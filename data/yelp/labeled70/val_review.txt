little wisco knows it ' s food . i ' ve had dinner here before which was good , but my late monday lunch was much more exciting and worth yelping . my friends and i walked in around Nish before the kitchen closed and they happily accommodated us with a kale salad , N fried chicken sammies and a cold beet soup . it was all delicious . the kale salad will turn you into a kale lover . the fried chicken sammy was better than the late peel ' s fried chicken sammy . we lingered at the bar for an hour and sipped on wine and ordered some dessert and the server , whom was very friendly , ended up giving us the left over deserts for free . apparently any deserts not sold during lunch are given to the staff or in my case , me ! 
my friends and i went here for a book group ( meetup ) i belong to , the noise level was nearly deafening . i am not dropping a star simply because it was a friday evening , but i could barely converse with the members of our table . the bento box that i had was excellent , but next time i might scale down my meal as my eyes were bigger than my stomach . i couldn ' t even finish it , or come close . word to the wise if you ' re getting a bento box , do not order a separate appetizer . i forgot about the parade of soup and salad beforehand . their service was good , but slower as we finished which was a bit frustrating for the gals who wanted to split . 
ok , so i have been here twice in the last few weeks . first visit my fiance and i had the hummus ( boring ) but when my chicken pot pie came i was blown away . the crust is flaky with sea salt lightly sprinkled on it . the creamy base with veggies and chicken was the best i have ever had . my fiance had a burger which he didn ' t like but when i let him try my pot pie he ate the rest of it . drinks ? he didn ' t order any specialty ones but when i asked for a chambord or poma margarita and they didn ' t have either they muddled some fresh raspberries to accommodate me which was very good . i liked that they made an effort or the service . second visit on N N N ! we ordered the the charcuterie board that we added humbolt fog cheese to and the bbq french fires . i love cheese so no issues there but the fries were ok . nothing special . for our mains of course we both ordered the chicken pot pies - ) overall , will go again and try out some of the meat preparations which went by the table many times and smelled great but with the pot pie to share as our appetizer . 
loveee the food ! ! ! fast delivery too ! ! cheap , cheap , cheap ! ! list of our favorites -- special chicken wings with that yummy sauce -- sesame chicken --egg foo young cash only though ( 
anyone who says this place is not outstanding is looking for the impossible . this place time after time proves how genuine and good the food is . pizzas are always top notch , meals are great , grinders to die for . hit it right and get the italian wedding soup , the best around , hands down . i wouldn ' t go anywhere else . thanks artie and john and the whole staff . you are all the best ! ! ! 
the spinach and artichoke pizza here always hits the spot . the serving sizes are large too . lines are typically long , especially as the night goes on , but it ' s always worth the wait . for seating , just go next door ( or two doors over ) . 
service is still very slow during lunch hour , good luck if your lunch time is limited to N hr ! finally , there ' s is wifi by time warner cable free for N minutes . really ? you can ' t install a router and provide free wifi ? ? ? or will it cost that much to provide N-N mind wifi ? ? the sign about the wifi service is so small and it seems so complicated . ( they have N ssids and each of them has a different way to log in ? ! ? ) f orget it ! i am so stressed out just trying to figure it out . maybe next time when i wait N min for my lunch special . ( food is still good ) 
i never write reviews unless it was really good . . . or really bad . there was nothing that i tried that i didn ' t like . the kindness of everyone that works there is a rare find . the atmosphere is nice . it ' s not noisy like you may imagine it would be . the food was excellent ! i highly recommend the blood orange margaritas ( these are the only margaritas i ' ve liked ) and el vez cake cannot be neglected from mentioning . excellent choice for anyone looking for good mexican cuisine . 
we had to book gramercy tavern a month in advance to get a reservation and apparently it is always fully booked . everything that needs to be said has already been said by previous reviewers and there is no doubt that this is a great place to eat . i do think that it is far too expensive and whilst we had a great meal , it isn ' t ' special ' . if you want really good food in a lovely setting then it ' s worth a try , but i wouldn ' t return . i also ate at their sister restaurant ( union sq cafe ) , which i actually thought was much better value . 
unbelievably delicious chicken and sides in this bright casual brooklyn restaurant . they have a great lunch special where you can get a half-chicken , bread , and N small sides for N . the jalapeno mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower were outstanding , but nothing compared to the chicken . i had a side of chutney which was also great . the owner was at the register and was very nice and helpful . . . . if i lived in brooklyn i would come here regularly . oh , and they have wifi . 
a few days ago i was craving for some korean food and decided to try goong for lunch . it was almost Npm when we reached this restaurant . i personally din ' t like the location of the plaza as it looked so isolated . this plaza is right opposite to aldi of east hartford . so we enter the restaurant and see there were hardly two tables occupied . the staff took sometime to seat us even though it was so relaxed . the menu had a lot of things . but i personally wanted to have some soup and i ordered a veg noodle soup and along side my husband added a hot veg pot . the lady then got a huge number of small cups filled with so many variety of food . the usual traditional korean culture . it had some eggs , sprouts salad , kimchi , cucumbers , zucchini , etc . . . the soup was disappointing so was the veg pot . i din ' t see any flavors in the soup and hardly there were any veggies . however the soup quantity is really huge . my husband wanted his meal to be spicy and had previously told the same . so the lady said , " yes i will make it spicy " . however the outcome was disappointing , no spice at all what so ever ! not sure if we want to dine in here again . the ambience is okay again nothing fancy and the staff is not friendly . the service was slow even though the restaurant was relaxed . i would not recommend this place to anyone till i give another shot . good for large groups too . parking is on site , you don ' t have to worry about it . 
the raves on this place , contrasted with my experience , has me further convinced that people eat for hype and truly do not understand good food . our small party of N placed orders for N different dishes , accompanied by N different sides . i kid you not , our meal arrived in N minutes , before our teas and coffees arrived . there is something unappetizing about eating a meal plated that quickly , especially when you realize that it ' s because everything is precooked- ever eaten stale thick-cut bacon ? don ' t . for the first time in my life , i left bacon on my plate . the mushrooms were rubbery ( understood- this happens when mushrooms are stale ) . fyi , an egg dish should not be served on tough to cut sourdough . think a biscuit next time . for people in the area , take the N minutes and walk to sweet chick . much much much much much better . 
ambiance - very ny , exactly what i would expect from a finance district restaurant . tall ceilings , great lighting , perfect place to impress a colleague , date , or go with a group of N-N . definitely a good lunch dinner drinks spot . food - great presentation , very flavorful and true to the menu descriptions . appetizers were good portion sizes , and the wait staff was clear about how many servings were appropriate for our group . the shrimp dish did come out cold , but the rest of the apps were very tasty , epically the vegetable samosas . my entr e the lamb vindaloo was one of the tastiest i ' ve ever had and someone else ordered the lamb chops which were equally as delicious . long story short - go with the lamb ! as for drinks , the house wine was a food network approved sparkling white that complimented desert perfectly and it ' s clear that the mixologist they had create the cocktail menu is an ace . all of the cocktails were unique , delicious and made just perfectly ! drink up ! service - the wait staff was excellent , very attentive , polite and eager to make the experience top notch . our waiter in particular knew the menu well and made several suggestions as we moved through the courses . in general , great place i will be back ! 
this is a really great place to go for a casual dinner . the beer selection is stellar and the burgers are fantastic . they even have a trivia night during the week which adds to a fun and casual ambiance . i give it two thumbs up . 
unique , delicious organic foods excellent presentation . i would go back in a heartbeat . when i went , i ordered a bison burger . it ' s something that isn ' t typically offered at many other places . i prefer eating organic , and bare burger shows that healthy foods can be tasty . the only negative thing was that the place was hard to find because their sign is difficult to read . 
i have to come here every week because it ' s so delicious and cheap . start feeling hungry when writing this review already ! ! ! 
we tried this place on a friday evening before attending a bonnie raitt concert . the food was quite good , but the real high point for us was our bartender , keith . he was attentive despite how crowded the bar became . he was knowledgeable about the menu , and made our entire experience a very pleasant one . we would eat here again , possibly even on a non show night . 
i had lunch at this place during soho shopping trip . small space yet cozy . food was served fast and staff was very friendly and nice . good pasta and pizza . 
salt fat . let those N words sink in deep . does anybody know if the chef is single ? cause i fell in love with his her food , i ' ll be fat forever , i dont care . starting in october they ' re open after N Npm . mary g . and i got there at N on the dot and were seated right away . cute place , simple decorations , me likey . luckily there was no calorie count on the menu ! food we started off with the famous popcorn popped in bacon fat , sinfully delicious . i ' ll never look at popcorn the same way again . we ordered this amazing salad with prosciutto , sweet walnuts , pears and goat cheese delicious . the sweetness of the pears with the salty prosciutto and creamy goat cheese was out of this world . if i can make salad like that i ' ll be sure to eat it everyday . we tried the scallops with roasted carrot puree , truffled golden beets . the scallops were cooked just right and the puree was so tasty . you only get three small scallops but this was by far my favorite dish . " crack " cheese was okay . not my favorite . the bacon and cheese were really good but i ' m not a big fan of gnocchi . hampshire pulled pork sliders were reallllllllly reallllllly good and flavorful . i love the happy face on the buns , nice touch . the pork was so juicy and tender , i like the fact that the bbq sauce wasnt overwhelming . i downed my food with an ice cold root beer ( they dont have coke which is a bummer ) dessert heres the thing the entrees were really tiny but the dessert was a huge . mary had the cucumber sorbet , really light and refreshing . i ordered the rice krispies , marshmallow ice cream , good god ! so damn good . you get N huge warm pieces of rice krispies with this amazing scoop of icecream that has the texture of a marshmallow but the flavor was really mild ( good thing cause i ' m not a big fan of marshmallows ) our waitress was the shit . she was really funny and attentive . after our meal we were given this yummy smoothie to help with the digestion ( didnt really work but it was really tasty ) the calories . what can i say ? the place is called salt fat . my love handles hate me right now . the portions are small but thats how they should be because there is no way you can consume a huge plate of anything on that menu ! i ' ll definitely be back . . . . . . . give myself a good month or two but i ' m looking for ward to it . 
i dont know what the other people are talking about , this place is as good as or maybe even better than sagami ( plus no tolls ) . i went with three other people and two bottles of wine ( its byob ) . we ordered about N pieces of sushi and sashimi , plus miso , seaweed salad , a few appetizers and an entree , i believe . the sashimi sampler was so fabulous ! the lime tofu sauce with the tuna and the octopus ( or squid , cant remember ) was so delicious . miso was a hit . salad was ok . beef negamaki and its accompanying side was yummy . the live scallop app was superb . after two bottles and the first round of food , we wanted more . we ran out for two more bottles of wine and reordered the sashimi sampler and few other favorites and added on the paridisio roll , and it was spectacular ! ! all in all , in was wonderful and our faux-japanese server was adorable . too expensive to go every week , but we will definitely be back , within the month
i don ' t think i ' ve ever even had any of their pizza but hey , you ' re in nj , you want good pizza you should know where to find it . we used to order junior ' s at all hours , they deliver until like Nam . i ' d get stuffed shells and manicotti bc i ' m a glutton like that and it ' d only cost me like N , i ' d get some bread with it , and i ' d get it delivered to me after midnight . what ' s not to like ? 
i went here a couple of years ago for my birthday with a groupon . i loved it here ! excellent belgium beer and mussels and my handsome waiter was very attentive and kind . great food , great service , and nice intimate and comfortable ambience . definitely not pretentious . 
even after i was full , i wanted to keep putting more of it inside me . but there was no more ( this place more than exceeded my expectations on what a good dining experience could be . they pull it off . the vibe , the food , the service , the drinks , etc . . . i want to eat everything they have . new personal goal . 
the most delicious , romantic pizzeria in town . the ingredients are always top quality and fresh , and the pizza is a bit fancier than at your typical corner pizzeria , but without pretension or sacrificing a traditional feel . the service is friendly and prompt , the wine is good , and the atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic . only thing that would make it better is more dessert options ( cannolis please ) and coffee ! 
they raised the prices of the buns to N ! grrr . . . . N . N per bun is outrageous , yet i sadly still ordered them . they have a new shrimp version ( N ) that i want to try next time ! i also had the samurai spareribs , which was soft and tender . . . . but a little over-sauced so it made me super thirsty . 
we went for the weekday buffet but upon paying , we found out that the restaurant is now charging the adult price for children of all ages . only babies and toddlers charged at children price . we all know how much babies and toddlers eat , and to charge any money at all is a ripoff . this restaurant is scamming families with children with maximum possible pricing for all guests . even N year olds are being charged the adult rate . if you value your money , do not support this greedy restaurant . 
i went to eli " s with my friends for a casual few drinks after dinner . withing N minutes of being there , they deemed myself too intoxicanted to order anything else . . . . because i was the only one in the bar to actually dance to the dj playing . i will never come back to this bar because they take a group of N girls and tell them that this is not the type of establishment they should be having fun at . and i am N . and extremely insulted . i recommended never coming to this bar . 
what makes this diner stand out from the rest in new jersey are the servers . in particular , counter queeen ( darlene ) and her team debbie and gg . these woman are an absolute delight and provide exceptional service . the rest ( food , atmosphere , cleaniness , etc , etc ) are pretty much the same as diners go in new jersey . 
so where do i start . . . . . this place was so laid back . my boyfriend and i went after a friend recommended it . . . . we got to sit in their backyard which was so peaceful . it was the perfect start to our date night . we had several happy hour specials which were awesome . the sever was good she was the only waitress for the back area and did a good job on checking on everyone . the food is amazing ! ! their huge on organic local foods including their ketchup ! ! i have recommended this place to other couples price is great too ! ! ! 
you can throw peanut shells on the floor . . . gotta love the place just for that ! good menu , good bar , good neighborhood feel . decent prices . 
it was worth the frigid walk to greenpoint to try out anella for brunch . we waited a bit at the bar before being seated . that plus the walk made us hungry so we started with a basket of pastries . all were good , but the banana muffin was excellent . for the main course my three friends all got the smoked whitefish salad . i wanted to be original and got the ricotta frittata . even though i was able to steal some whitefish salad from my friends , i actually wish i ordered it as well ! not that the frittata was bad , quite the opposite , but the whitefish salad was that good . smoky , salty , delicious . this experience , coupled with the fact that the dishes were all about N , makes this a good choice for a regular brunch spot . 
the sheep ' s milk dumplings with pine nuts , spinach , and spicy lamb sausage ( N . N ) was my pick , thanks to the photo submissions by yelpers . it ' s on the salty side , but the savoriness seemed to be sourced from the sun-dried tomatoes . the sheep milk cheese is soft and melts in the mouth . it ' s very filling for N i had leftovers . my friend got the N . N N-course dinner special . you have maybe N-N choices of each course . the greek salad was put together well . the tubular pasta is an excellent choice for marinara-loving individuals . the rice pudding dessert does not impress me much . the staff took care of us well . i would return the next time i pay the museum of natural history a visit , and try the lamb shank . 
i don ' t even know where to begin . from the moment we were seated at our table till the moment we left , we were treated so well by marcello and his staff . the menu , though limited , is exceptional . everything is prepared to absolute perfection . the service has always been excellent and the food has been invariably good and innovative . the waiter also knew the dish in and out and gave us a few alternatives . when the staff presented each course , they never mixed up our dishes and they describe each one in detail . our wine and water glasses were never empty . someone would notice as you stood up and showed you the way to the restroom . awesome service . we enjoyed every second of experience at gramercy tavern . of course it was not inexpensive , but certainly great value for money . 
i ' ve driven by and walked by this place before , and finally decided to give it a try . i was able to place an order quickly . i asked a question about the pesto sauce that was listed as part of one of the sandwiches . i wanted to know what was in it . first person , stared at me blankly . second person , told me parsley . i volunteered that it was most likely basil , and that i was interested in whether or not it was pine nuts or walnuts . finally someone from the kitchen overheard , and the pesto is made with pine nuts there ! i ordered the avocado dream sandwich . in the time it took to prepare my sandwich , N people ( i counted ) who ordered after me received their orders . the sandwich is described as grill vegetables , avocado , cheese , and pesto sauce . the grilled vegetables were very inconsistent in terms of size , so that green pepper was only on one half of the sandwich , and zucchini was only on the other half . the sandwich was also very greasy . i do not think this was exclusively the fault of the pesto sauce . i might try the place again , but i would try something else . but , i ' m not going to go out of my way to eat there again . 
the samizen lunch special is the best deal . for N you get a nice assortment of sashimi , tempura , soba , and some other dishes . consistently excellent . wish there was a greater range of appetizers . but they know what they are good at , so i can ' t fault them for sticking to their strengths . 
so great ! ! i love this spot so much . the food is amazing , and even though they are stellar at pizza , there are plenty of gluten free and less starchy items on the menu . the cheese from eastern district is the best , and the chickpea pancake thing is a treat . the mimosas are fresh and delicious , and the pinot grigio is really good and affordable--especially by the " litter . " the record evening ( tuesday ? ) also seems amazing , with way better music than you could expect from any restaurant or bar , although i have only wandered into it once . in general the music is dope . the servers are really cool and nice . 
i had brunch here with a friend and liked it a lot . it ' s got a nice cozy bustling atmosphere , not too loud . the food was very good , unusual and fresh . we had the dips with pita , which is a great way to try things . the service was excellent for the first part of the meal but did fall apart when the restaurant got full later on . 
great food , great prices , with great friends . i needed a place that was near union square , not too pricey , and good for groups and one of the results was de andrea ' s . i ' m a little skeptical about italian because form past experience , it ' s either really good or really bad . i was just hoping that it was decent so i wouldn ' t be embarrassed in front of my friends . luckily this place exceeded my expectation . first , half our party arrived really early , but the staff was very accommodating and seated us even though the other half wasn ' t go arrive for another N minutes . when everyone finally arrived , we finally got to ordering . we all decided to split le tigelle ( prosciutto appetizer ) and cozze ( mussels ) . the prosciutto was very interesting . the meat itself was pretty tasty and not dry , which often times happens . it was served with flat buns which hot to the touch and made for a delicious sandwich-like treat . the mussels were okay . unfortunately , they weren ' t cleaned out too well and a couple of mine still had sand in them . however , the wine tomato sauce was amazing . we ended up asking for multiple baskets of bread to soak up the sauce , which is another reason why i loved this place . we ended up getting four baskets of bread and the servers never batted an eye . and the focaccia was so moist ! for an entree , i got the cavatelli . italian restaurants are always just okay for me because pasta is just pasta . da andrea ' s was so good i had to write about it . first , the pasta was cooked perfectly , very chewy but still having substance . and another thing , the shrimp was also cooked perfectly ! normally , shrimp in pasta is overcooked and tough , but da andrea ' s shrimp was very tender and " bouncy . " the salmon was also cooked well . altogether with the pesto sauce and seafood , this made for a very hearty , tasty , and overall enjoyable dish ! i came here on a whim and came out loving this place . it was a monday night , but the place was packed with people , so i guess it ' s not a huge secret . also , it didn ' t break the bank . i was more than satisfied and actually took home leftovers for under N ! whether you ' re with a large group or looking for a place for an intimate date , da anrea ' s great for anything ! pros attentive and courteous service , taste , quality of cooking ingredients dishes to try le tigelle , cozze , cavatelli
good food great service ! ! ! ! 
amazing , amazing . i went here when it first opened and have been a fan ever since . lots of great , tasty options . only problem is how popular it has gotten , which makes getting a table a nightmare ! 
service is quick . food is decent . this place gets an extra star for it ' s convenience . it ' s open very late , ( i think around N a . m . ) so when i ' m around the area , i know this is the place to go to fill you up . you ' ll find the most random people late night though so don ' t be alarmed . 
went to lunch here with a girlfriend today and the experience was perfect . the service was exceptional . our server was a tall gentleman who was very kind and helpful . we got their signature calamari appetizer , which was recommended by our server , and it was delicious ! ! ! my friend got the penne vodka which she requested without prosciutto ( she ' s pregnant ) and added grilled chicken . out waiter obliged kindly . i got the three cheese stuffed eggplant lunch and it was yummy ! ! great experience . i will definitely be going there again ! ! 
i came to ippudo with high expectations after hearing it was the " best ramen in nyc " but left slightly disappointed . the wait time to get seated here is insane ( N hours ) and to top it off the hostess accidentally put us down for N instead of N , which resulted in an even longer wait . if the ramen was amazing i would not have minded but honestly , it wasn ' t worth the price or the wait . i had the akamaru modern and although the noodles were perfect and the flavor was good , the broth was very salty making the ramen hard to enjoy after the first couple of bites . others at the table tried the tori ramen which was not as salty but also not as flavorful . the star of our meal was definitely the hirata buns . the buns were perfect and the spicy sauce complimented the pork really well . service here was also pretty good , our waitress was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed . overall , probably would not come here again but might be be willing to give this place another try if the wait time was significantly reduced . 
not bad for the price
i thought this was going to be a N-star place but the a la carte food just didn ' t live up to the expectations in terms of taste and each plate was tiny for the price that you ' re paying . i would have gone with the N-course but someone in my group correctly pointed out that N for ( fusion ) korean food is ridiculous . the decor is beautiful and the wait staff was amazeballs . food amuse of sesame chip with yuzu compote , tofu , fried chicken , slider - nothing really stood out . the slider was awful . the sesame chip with yuzu was decent and the fried chicken was ok but a little soggy for me earl grey tea brioche - pretty good octopus - just a few bites of vegetables and a few small pieces of octopus that were slightly fishy sea urchin with seaweed and rice - sea urchin wasn ' t of the highest quality but it was good but the seaweed and rice underneath was a bit bland bouillabaisse with regular shrimp , octopus , enoki mushrooms , fish , scallop , mussels - N for a couple of scoops of seafood ? overall , it was decent but this isn ' t something i would order again . lobster with raspberry sauce - good lobster but nothing special the sauce wasn ' t overly delicious or anything wagyu ( N N portion - N little pieces ) - the marbled pieces were very chewy and actually good but the kimchee sauce did not complement them well galbi ( N N portion - N little pieces ) - very chewy but decent ginger with fruits palate cleanser - this is one of the best parts of the meal strawberry cremeux with spinach sponge cake - this was very good
i wish i was allowed to swear on here , because i don ' t know how to express my absolutely awesome experience here without using some forceful expressions . as i showed up with my girlfriend for our Npm reservation we were greeted warmly and seated promptly without a fuss , even though the restaurant was pretty busy and bustling at this point . we started with a mini seafood tower that wasn ' t very mini at all , and absolutely delish . some other reviewer wrote about the shrimp , and they are that good . next up rib-eye for two . probably one of the best pieces of steak i ' ve had in a long time . sides were also really good , but were kind of left in the wake of the the main dishes . there was this cauliflower gratin though , which was good enough on its own as maybe an appetizer or so . we skipped dessert this time , but our server caught that me and my girlfriend was celebrating a promotion , and discreetly brought over two glasses of sparkling dessert wine on the house . how ' s that for attentive service ? i am hard pressed for negatives it is a cool bar scene , but even if it looked busy over at the bar , our table in the back room was quiet and secluded . this one of my new favorite spots , and i think it is great either for a date , or maybe a medium sized group of foodie carnivores ? f k yeah ! 
i often entertain clients here for lunch as it quite close to the biotech ' s i work with and i have never been let down , i have even brought a few of their salads home for dinner . it ' s a simple atmosphere , great service , attentive staff and easy parking . 
this restaurant is tarnishing the name of jamaican jerk chicken restaurants and its about time someone speaks about it . my wife brought me a plate and th food tastes like brown carribean suger , what happened to the jamaican jerk spice ? are the cooks really from jamaica or from china cuz from what i know chinese put alot of sugar in their food . if i needed a sugery food i would have ate cereals at home . ya need to do ya home work and give the people their moneys wealth . a word to a wise is enough . 
pretty damn good burgers . talk about yum at Nam . the burger meat crumbles so perfectly in your mouth . the N stars are because N ) before Nam , i ' m sure there are better burgers around . . they are in noway just decent though . N ) you have to persevere through an almost nauseating line just to order these burgers . 
i recently took a trip to nyc and we needed somewhere quick to eat because we needed to catch our bus back home . i asked siri where the nearest pub was , and it led us to rattle ' n ' hum . first walking in , i was a little iffy about how things would turn out . but let me tell you , i am very glad we ended up here ! the food was fabulous . ( i had a cheeseburger slider and their mac and cheese ) and their beer list had close to N beers , maybe even more . i definitely recommend this little pub ! 
took my son there today for lunch , what has happened to this place , first the waitress was to busy takeing care of her kid instead of taking care of the customers . i ordered the chicken with shiitake mushrooms , " which is on the menu " when she brought it out it was made with button mushrooms . i told her that this was not what i ordered . she went back to the kitchen and then told me they were out . i asked why did you serve me something i did not order . she had no answer . i hope the owner reads this and can explain to me why they served me this
one word amazing ! 
lupa ' s food has impressed me in the past . but never its service . and tonight was absolutely embarrassing . my boyfriend made reservations for a Npm table for two , and we were turned away at the door told that " you aren ' t in the system . " of course , there is little we could do to argue with their apparently infallible " system " ( and the people who use it ) , and the smarmy attitude of the boy at the door and the woman on the other end of the reservations line insinuated that we were trying to pull a fast one . thank god that this city has plenty of excellent italian , so we won ' t have to bother with the attitude at lupa again . 
we were N people , seeing a show across the street , and needed a place nearby . i admit expectations were limited , but i have to say , we had a very good dinner here . ambiance is bustling and hectic , and we had a large round table that was plenty roomy . server was friendly , attentive and efficient . knowing about the large portions , we were careful not to over order . we started with the fried calamari -- while the rings could ' ve been fried a little darker , it was perfectly good , crispy and hot , and neither greasy nor rubbery . next up was a caesar salad , also a pleasant surprise -- the romaine leaves were very fresh and crisp , and the dressing lightly applied tableside with a fresh lemony zing and not too salty . we only ordered two mains -- chicken scarpariello ( whole bird version ) and linguine with shrimp ( subbing garlic oil for marinara sauce ) . we opted for the chicken with roasted potatoes , peppers and italian sausage , and it arrived on an enormous oval platter -- we couldn ' t finish it , but it was delicious hot , flavorful and garlicky with juicy meat , good sausage , charred peppers , crisp potato chunks and a nice , winey sauce . the shrimp tasted fresh enough and formed a nice , lighter counterpart to the hearty chicken . we had a rutherford cab to wash it all down and were out with time to spare for the show . a very good alternative to trattoria trecolori ( which i also like for pre-theater ) , especially with a larger group ( say N ) . 
i used to order the pies from ginos only when alberto was making them , i would literally call and if he was not working not order , now he has his own pizzeria and honestly its the best pizzeria around period . . never a hickup . . 
pio pio has the best rotisserie chicken in the city . it ' s tender , moist , and flavorful . make sure to use a good amount of the green sauce , which has a nice tangy , spicy taste . the french fries , avocado salad , and tostones are other hits . be careful as the portions are huge . a single entree can feed at least two if not three . great ambiance and service as well . waiters are friendly and attentive . good for birthday dinners ! last but not least , their sangria is awesome - sweet but strong . 
the take out was great . we ordered the mozzarella di bufala and chicken parm , both were delicious and the packaging for delivery worked well - the mozzarella basil tomato stayed in place . definitely will be ordering again . 
it ' s a preserved historic landmark for a reason . the prepared foods , fish , and meats , and poultry , and baked goods are fresh , the prices are inexpensive , and the selection and variety are without compare . i found it too crowded at lunchtime , but greatly enjoyed breakfast there . 
i ' m a little afraid to write this review . with all the N- and N-star reviews , how can i give los tacos only a N-star review ? well . . . . the tortilla is thin . it ripped once i picked it up . the meat is dry - both the adobada ( pork ) and pollo asado ( chicken ) . the flavor is a little underwhelming and the texture is inconsistent . some pieces were meaty and some pieces were a little like jerky . understandably , i went at Npm during a Npm closing day . perhaps because it was near closing time , the food wasn ' t the same caliber as it would be during the lunch and dinner rush . but an establishment shouldn ' t let that affect the quality of the food . for a spot that boasts to be no . N , they sure didn ' t serve no . N food . 
this place is awesome ! food is cooked just right . . . the fish ? amazing ! place is small but if you go in alil later in the day . . . you will get a seat almost immediately ! prices are a tad bit on the high side but well worth it and really not that significant ! they don ' t sell pork if you like that . but the turkey bacon is good . ( i love pork bacon ) but don ' t notice it missing when eating here ! it ' s a good and bad thing that this place is literally N minutes from me ! 
absolutely loved this place from the moment i walked in until the moment i left . everyone was incredibly welcoming and warm . the hostess and the owner introduced themselves to us and encouraged us to let them know if anything was less than perfect . our waiter was very knowledgeable and recommended some great wines and tapas . my friend and i had had the sauteed mushrooms over garbanzo polenta , which was wonderful . the mushrooms were tender and rich and the polenta was so silky that we wondered if they had a special food processor or something to grind the garbanzos . we also had croquetas which rivaled the ones i had in spain when i studied abroad crispy and salty on the outside , creamy and delicious on the inside . finally , my favorite were the crujientes with mahon , thyme , honey , and sea salt . i had read about these on smitten kitchen and had been looking forward to them ever since i had made my reservation . unfortunately they were not on the menu , but our very accommodating and kind waiter made a request in the kitchen and the chef very nicely whipped some up for us . they were absolutely fantastic crunchy , sweet , salty , and such depth of flavor ! for our entrees ( yes we ate more ! ) we each had fideos , a small spanish pasta . i had mine with lamb and my friend had " de la huerta . " i could not really tell what was in hers , but it looked delicious . mine was wonderful and the perfect size to follow all the tapas . this place is gorgeous and somehow strikes two perfect notes with atmosphere it is both cozy and intimate but the close tables and music that is just barely a little too loud create a great vibe and energy . i had a wonderful experience here and cannot wait to return ! 
awesome rotisserie chicken . so good with the avocado salad and the mojo sauce . i don ' t think we needed the fries -- total filler . but the shrimp dish ? the one everyone else is talking about ? the one i don ' t remember the name of ? the one that made me end a question with a preposition ? that is so good . i would like three of those with a side of rotisserie chicken covered in mojo sauce , please . to go . 
yummy ! ! ! super delish ( what i think ) is authentic nyc pizza . service was fast and right outside my hotel . i also had the lentil soup which came with a delicious side of sourdough garlic bread ( yum ) will definitely be recommending this place ! 
we ate here for the first time and had a great experience . the food was great - we had the trout salad , duck salad , lamb with red beans and rice and chicken wings . the spicy beef jerky was also really tasty and just spicy enough . recommended ! the wait staff were great and attentive in just the right way . 
i have been here only N different times . once was out to dinner with my boyfriend and another was for a party . as soon as you walk in the aroma of all their specials , being cooked instantly takes over . my boyfriend and i went on a weekend night , the place was packed ! the menu is outstanding . the variety of specials offered to us for that evening were amazing . there was such a variety to pick from . the waitress was pleasant , but busy . i have many younger years experience as a waitress so i knew her pain that night - but that night as definitely a good night for her as well ! timing of food brought out was perfect . my pasta special was amazing . when i went back for a party i loved how the entire left dining room can be rented out for parties . again , a variety of choices were presented to us for each course . that side room is nice and private and food was once again amazing ! ! ! highly recommend this place ! 
this place is yummmm-meeeeee it has a nice romantic vibe to the restaurant , except for the countless number of times you ' ll hear a table or four sing ( completely off tune , i may add ) the " happy birthday " song . ( i literally counted N times in my dining experience ) . i also came here to take my date ( now bf ) to celebrate his bday here but no belching of the happy birthday song from this table . i figure all the diners got their fair share of the happy birthday already . i ' m big on any tapas place , why ? . . . because of the variety , of course ! " they " do say variety is the spice of life , and by " they " i have no idea to whom " they " are referring to . brussel sprouts are amazing here , but i ' m sure you ' ve read that already . the only other place i ' ve enjoyed the brussel sprouts as much is at cleo in hollywood , ca . i would recommend trying to get a seat upstairs for a more intimate dining experience with your dining companion . . . . ( all the big loud birthday parties are usually at the tables on the first floor ) unless of course you are looking to be one of the big loud birthday parties . they only take cash here , so be prepared . also , best not to get too tipsy here , i accidentally did the math wrong and ended up tipping N in cash ( the drinks are pretty strong here ) . ouch . . . now i know why they call it " tipsy " ! 
i went to dante ' s for first time in a serious long time about fifteen years ago ( i . it made me sad as it used to be such a gloriously shabby place . back in the day , we were waited on by the same guy for about N years . shady characters hanging out in the bar . the manual typewritten menus . the cash only policy ( this before atms ) . the place now is fine , food is good , it tries a little too hard to be " authentic " , the old formica tables were somehow much more authentic then the current decor . sorry to be one of those guys who wish for the good ole days , dante ' s is fine , it just isn ' t magic anymore . 
my friend lives in brooklyn and within walking distance of roberta ' s . it was our first food stop on my trip to new york with my friendzz . i love that they have not-so-typical toppings . the ingredients were fresh and the dough was perfect . i love that they have vegetarian options that are effortless in the sense that i don ' t wish there was meat on it . ( fyi i ' m not a vegetarian ) . i had a pizza with corn ( omg , genius ) other veggies , as well as the margarita pizza ( ! ! ! ! ) . we had to wait , but there ' s a bar in the back , so time passed by quickly . do they deliver to california ? ? or can they build a pizza oven in my backyard ? ? i ' m about to make a very bold statement , but this is seriously one of thee best pizza i ' ve ever had and i ' ve eaten a lot ( like , no really . . . a lotttttt ) of pizza . 
i work in harford and get to " the steam " frequently for lunch . the beers are excellent , naughty nurse is a winner . i have tried many things on the menu and like most restuarnts there are hits and misses . the hits far out number the misses for sure . the service and consideration of the staff is excellent . i have seen first hand the caring and attention given to satisfying the customers . beer and homemade rootbeer excellent . they are ambitious and creative with the menu and come up with some serious flavors and combinations of sauces and spicing . i think they can be N . N or N . N cheaper , but the prices are consistent with downtown . no chili on the menu or on the nacho ' s ! ( small flaw ) the portions are solid . the steam is relaxed and casual . is it fine dining ? no . but for brew pub it ' s pretty darn good ! 
for anyone looking for that perfect outdoor restauran this summer for deliciously appetizing food , a nice selection of wine , and great service , this is your place . i came down from manhattan to visit a friend for the weekend and was very impressed with this restaurant ! it will be my first stop back on my next visit to the area . we only waited for about N minutes without having a reservation on a saturday night and were seated in the beautiful outdoor space . ( they have a chic and open inside area as well that we walked through which was beautiful too ) . for appetizer we shared an awesome pork dumpling dish that i couldn ' t get enough of- myfriend and i were talking about them all night ! i also really enjoyed the salmon with peaches for my entree . it was perfectly cooked and tasted so fresh- the perfect summer fare before a night out on the town . our server did such a great job recommending wine to go with our meal and was always there to top of our glasses . for anyone who has not been yet , i highly recommend N manning grill ! ! i can ' t wait for my next visit to N manning grill for another great taste of philadelphia ! 
make no mistake , the pizza at santucci ' s is excellent . however , on a recent visit we got a salad that was drenched with dressing and was uneatable . upon return of the waitress to our table , we notified her of the problem and the salad was taken off the table . upon receipt of our bill , we were disappointed the salad remained on the bill . we asked the waitress who said she did bring it to the attention of the owner but he refused to take it off the bill . the owner refused to acknowledge a request to speak about the situation and refused to come out of the back . this is not the first we observed rude behavior on part of the owner ( or manager ) . secondly , as we were waiting for the owner to acknowledge the problem , we noticed an abundance of cameras and perhaps microphones in the dining area . not sure why a byob would need such high security . it seems like from the reviews i have read that i am not the only person who has encountered horrific service at this establishment . personally , i will never patronize the poor behavior of this establishment . 
i came here based on what i overheard in town , the place looked pretty rundown . but i think that ' s what gives it the charm it has . you can tell this place is a boonton secret . i came in and had some random nice man pay for my meal . this place honestly revived my faith in this town ! i was feeling so down in the dumps - had my car keyed- thought i was going to fork over N to fix it - then i came here and it was a breath of fresh air . the waitress was so friendly , the food was fabulous , the patrons are so welcoming . it ' s an experience . a great experience . thank you ! 
this is the pizza that everyone waits in line N hours for ? ? ? 
comfort food . shepherd ' s pie was delish ! will be trying the burger next time . the irish breakfast was so-so or just maybe not my thing . blue moon on tap was a huge plus ! 
i enjoyed the atmosphere , for it was very relaxing especially when they have musicians come in to perform on saturday nights . however , it was very crowded so i would recommend coming in on a week day . the choices to personalize your ice cream are excellent . for you will get a taste of every candy you love and your favorite ice cream in their famous blend in . the employees are always smiling and willing to help . defiantly worth a five star review . 
came here on a friday night , with a N N reservation for two in the summer . the place was packed however our table was waiting for us to my surprise . we were looking for a sexy environment to romance in candle light and got it here ! the staff is laid back and knowledgeable about wines and dinner specials . it was nice not to feel hurried in any way and we did take our time . the drinks came quickly and we were brought complimentary crab salad on toast . i love unexpected complimentary stuff ! the kitchen is open , tiny and very busy and makes for some entertainment it looked like the cooks were putting on a show for us . they have a big garden patio that is an after work scene but closes early for the neighbors . 
delicious falafel , for a price . if you can get on board with the idea of spending N-N for a falafel and a drink at lunch , you won ' t be disappointed . 
what made me fall in love with crepes . i love this area , i love this restaurant . 
a great , family friendly affordable restaurant . yesterday i ate with my two daughters ( N , N ) . we were full and very happy with the service quality of food . my girls had the vegetarian quesadillas , i had the grilled beef burritos both delicious . the owner was very nice . i also tried the homemade salsa mild and hot , incredible . will definitely come back soon specially during this cold weather . 
best pancakes ever . . . . . . perfectly balanced ! d the rest of the food is great as well service is great , they are nice attentive . the space is a bit tight 
love the egg cake , and veggie steamed dumplings . seating can be cramped at times . staff is friendly . 
apart from their cheesesteak , i really liked the roast pork hoggies . 
good , consistent diner food . clean and predictable . best diner in the area . 
charming garden seating behind the store with friendly wait staff . it ' s a somewhat laid-back atmosphere , but service was a little painfully slow . we went for brunch , and the eggs nola was the winner . the cornbread was very tasty and the cajun-spiced tasso ham i could eat every day for breakfast , lunch , or dinner . the egg was perfectly runny . the bacon-latticed mac and cheese pie sounded promising , but the chef ' s choice cheese of the day was a type of blue cheese , which i am not a fan of . if there is a particular type of cheese you don ' t prefer , i suggest you ask before your order . if i liked the cheese , i would ' ve killed it . the orange juice was not fresh-squeezed , so i was a little disappointed . it doesn ' t say so in the menu , but for some reason i expected it to be so . french press coffee was decent . i ' ll be back for the paninis ! 
beware szechuan food is spicy ! ! but so good . . . real deal chinese food , better than chinatown . price is reasonable . lunch special menu is good and reasonable . 
maialino deleted my previous review , stating that they treat minority customers poorly . hey maialino , enjoy reading this and paying yelp to remove this review again . went here last week . worst service ever . terribly rude . white supremacy extreme . do not be fooled by the average of N stars ! ! ! if there is one think i hate more than maialino , is liars . maialino , you are a liar ! 
you guys . i think i ' m in love with a dinosaur . we came in on a rather chilly wednesday night . there was no wait and we got seated right away . now i am no expert on bbq , but i am an expert eater and bbq is one of my faves . to start off , one friend had the swag sampler and said he thought it was delish . i tried a really small piece of the fried green tomato and it was definitely flavorful and yummy . i ordered the tres ninos ( small samplings of brisket , pulled pork , and ribs ) with mac n cheese and harlem potato salad . let ' s start with my favorite , the brisket- so flavorful . i love meats that stand alone w o having to add any additional things to it and the brisket definitely delivered . the ribs were my next favorite . juicy , fatty . . . . yum . the pulled pork was just meh to me . i felt it was bland and definitely was nothing to write home about . now for the sides . i wasn ' t thrilled . they are more or less what you ' d expect . the potato salad felt like it was something you could get at a grocery store . not that there ' s anything wrong with that , just not breath taking . the mac n cheese was pretty good , though it seemed rather heavy . i felt more like i was eating butter macaroni than cheesy macaroni . finally , we got some chicken wangs to go to help us get through the winter storm thats outside right now , and my goodness . these wings are unbelievable . they ' re flavored really well , the meat is really juicy . they come with a blue cheese dressing but they don ' t even need it . to summarize brisket- you must try this . ribs- also good . pulled pork- meh . wings- try now or take home and try later . sides- also meh . dinosaur bbq definitely delivers as far as bbq is concerned . 
i always have a good time here . i love the cozy feel , affordable menu and good food . the bartenders are always a bit to relaxed but they are quite pleasant and get things right . you can watch a game but its not a loud sports bar . i happily voted for it as " best bar " for philly mag ' s best of list . 
i may be living in manhattan for too long and my sense of what ' s reasonable is shot , but you seriously can ' t beat N unlimited mimosas and bloody marys with attentive servers who arent stingy on refills . separate from that , the menu has a lot of variety and well priced - we did the N for N brunch items menu , and msot memorable for me were the potato pancakes ( freshly makde and not at all heavy ) and tropical fruit bowl ( diced up with a citrus dressing and dollop of cocount sorbet ) . overall , the food is thoughtful , delicious , and proportioned just right . the space is casual but modern , similar to the rest of its lic neighborhood . would come abck ( and maybe drag some manhattanites in ) 
i decided to revisit cafe ollin yesterday to catch up with a friend and had a wonderful experience yet again . this little family run gem is truly as authentic as can be . their service is prompt and polite , and their food is fresh and homemade . we split the nachos con carne and got N taco con todo ( " everything " ) each . i would highly recommend choosing anything featuring their spicy pork ( carne enchilada ) , which was my favorite meat of them all . the tacos come on double corn tortillas that are warm and soft , with heaping piles of meat , cojita cheese , avocado , sour cream , onion , and cilantro . i keep meaning to order the cemitas but the tacos are so good that i always resort to them ! east harlem is slightly shady and out of the way , but this place is worth the trek . solid N stars for food , service , and price . ( also used a N for N yelp coupon , which was accepted without a problem . ) 
the decor is very nice , the food is simple but good . service is good . i wouldn ' t go here without a restaurant . com certificate but with it the food is just really good value . 
jalapeno grits are worth the trip . packed loud young yuppie but down to earth crowd . fun to go with friends . 
went here last night on the spur of . i ' ve been going here a couple of times now and even went to their restaurant when it was still on franklin ave in hartford . i love love their eggplant with yogurt sauce on top and pumpkin puree . i usually get a lamb dish and spinach rice with the entree but last night i wanted to have their trout again . i was so looking forward to having the trout since i remember it being light , fresh with lemon and spices but sadly they were out of it last night . very disappointed especially we came when there were only three other people having dinner that night ( we came around N pm ) so i was surprised that they were already out . hmm . . . anyways had the chicken kebab instead and that was good . shared the plate with a friend and it was enough to fill me up . definitely if you also get an appetizer . im definitely still a fan but i hope next time i come , they don ' t run out of the stuff im looking forward to having . try it ! 
brunch is good ! even better with a window view of the hudson ! i would recommend their omelette and benedict . i ' ve tried their french toast and rib hash which are tasty but not amazing . next time i hope to try their special burger . their pastries and baked goods look delicious but i have yet to try . this place is worth a try of you ' re in the area ( high line ) but probably wouldn ' t go out of the way to see . 
i also stopped in on a weeknight , and basically can echo the previous review . this place looks great inside . i never saw it before the renovation . non-smoking is a major plus . i sat at the bar , which was very busy for a weeknight . fast turnover of customers . locals drop in , grab a burger and a drink or two , and head out . the atmosphere was laid back and friendly . lauren was behind the bar , and she is friendly and professional , without being over the top . my martini was perfect and ample . i didn ' t eat , but N of the people at the bar ordered burgers . they looked delicious , and no one complained . i stopped in a few weeks later early on a friday night and the place was jam packed . that is not my type of scene , so i left immediately , but i was impressed that they could draw that kind of crowd early . the continental benefits from its central location , ample parking , and the fact that probably half of yardley ' s population can walk to the place . no real competition is a nice factor in their favor as well . all they need to do is keep up the good work , and this is the place where people in yardley will go for a drink and a sandwich . the yardley inn is just a few blocks away , but it ' s a totally different scene . 
had been here several times . second time was a disaster . we came here on a weekend late noon , and ordered two ramen , one cake , and a hot tea . the server forgot the tea completely until we remind her . i mean . . . i understand this place gets very busy all the time , and i was fine with it . but . . . . . the ramen didn ' t come after N min . the tables next to us came after us , and their noodle was half finished . the server told us that the kitchen stopped our order because they were closing out . what ? ! but she said they are cooking for us already , and it will be out soon . so at the end , we got the cake for free , drinks are also on the house . i was here for many time before and after , nothing like this ever happened . so i believe it was a one time thing . . . and the server was super nice . i would definitely come back again , but just hoping something like this won ' t happen to me anymore s
this place was awesome . we did the all you can eat option fro N . the ambiance was spectacular - dark , swanky , and not too crowded . everyone loved the sushi as well as the standard asian items you could order . there seem to be more and more of these places popping up , but this is clearly the best in the area . this is , in part , due to the fresh and high quality food , but also the staff . they were more than friendly , attentive , and really made it a fun dining experience . byob too . 
great spot for what it is . cheap , no frills vietnamese with a few nepalese dishes also . the banh mi is a great deal for N . N- N . N . i prefer the chicken to the pork ( similar to bologna ) . the dumplings are simple and delicious . i especially like the salsa-like dipping sauce they come with . last time i was there , they had pyaji ( similar to pakoras ) N for N . i love the feel of the place . it ' s much smaller than pho dang and pho hong ( only N tables ) and feels kind of like you ' re eating in someone ' s home . will be back often ! 
the owner chef should be embarrassed . really not good . 
when you walk in you get a sense of a cozy environment . the lights are dim , the service is good , and you hear people chatting . the food here is good . i had the steak frites and it was good . it was tender and juicy with just the right amount of seasoning . i also had a piece of my friends pork chop . it was moist and cooked very nicely . my friend was complaining about his lamb being overcooked . i have to say the food was good except the desserts . i did not find them to be worth it . maybe because i just had some awesome dessert previously and was comparing . 
if you ' d like to visit france or tunisia , check this fun place out . authentic decor , great food and service . a gem . we had the couscous ( veggie version ) and the chicken baguette sandwich for lunch and finished it off with the tiramisu . everything was excellent , but the tiramisu is the best we have ever had , and we are like , tiramisu freaks ! worth going just for that for sure . 
we had an amazing time here last night . sampled a mix of snacks and small plates , and lauren the bartender turned us onto some tasty treats and the most original pickleback i ' ve ever had . this place is not messing around ! 
le parisien is a quaint bistro reminiscent of a small paris caf . start with the escargot and mop up the delicious green garlic sauce with plenty of bread that they bring to the table . i usually never order salads at restaurants because too many are uninspired and boring , but the endive salad was creative both in taste as well as presentation . can ' t go wrong with mussels here-- i have tried the parisienne and espagnole and both are delicious and large portions . the frites that come with the mussels are crispy and perfect for dipping in the sauce . the duck confit entr e was good but not great and quite a small portion , especially in comparison to the mussels . 
fabulous guacamole ! 
delicious ! five of us for dinner started with the hummus ( made from cannellini beans , not chickpeas ) and the ahi tuna bruschetta . both were different than expected -- the hummus very creamy and the tuna still warm from being seared -- but excellent . we gobbled up two bowls of delicious housemade chips as well . three of us had mac and cheese variations classic , mushroom and lobster . the lobster version had great chunks of perfectly cooked lobster meat , the mushroom one was delicious in its earthiness and the classic was the cheesiest mac and cheese i ' ve ever tasted . out of this world ! rounding out the entrees were the fish tacos -- i didn ' t try them but everyone else said they were great and a mediterranean salad with added chicken . no room for dessert . something for everyone and reasonably priced , excellent food . we ' ll definitely be back soon . there is a large parking lot that is littered with signs claiming it is only for the health food store we parked there anyway and according to our waitress that ' s no problem . also , they have a small wine list , but you can also byob . 
my kinda joint , laid back and tasty broiled burger served no frills and with prompt service . good value pub . 
the restaurant doesn ' t know the definition of fusion . the food was terrible . cold salad on top of warn and cold rice . the fish i had was overly fried , for an area such as rodin place where people are interested in healthy food this not the place , 
simple perfection , made with love , great service . . . . had brunch , came back later to eat again . always a nice crowd , people laughing , having a great time . sit at the bar if chris is bartending , teresa is also a great server . . . just good people with great hearts , an eye for detail , and amazing charisma . all around an excellent experience . try the dutch baby pancakes . . . . the burger . . . and work through the drink menu . . . all of it . 
big portions great service ! 
simply superb . i just came back home , its one of the best food i have experienced in new jersey . i heard good reviews from my friends so thought of going and traveled almost N miles to parsippany but its totally worth it . " a must go place " if you did not visit yet . 
delicious farm to table food in a comfortable setting inside the chelsea market . get the sausage with lentils . nom nom . 
nice place . i have ordered sushi from here N times and i have noticed that the special rolls are really good but if you get the regular ones like california or boston it ' s crappy . better spend a few more bucks and get a special roll . for a year now i believe they have chinese food as well which is really cool . sometime i get chinese and the miso soup ! perfect combination . do not recommend to eat inside . a bit weird atmosphere but they do deliver quick and the food is delicious . always get free soda d
if you follow the " there ' s a long line it must be good " mantra , then you ' re right . . . king of falafel shawarma is the best ! there ' s a line all the time ( but the wait it roughly N minutes ) . . . and if you ' re lucky , you ' ll get a free falafel just for waiting around . chicken and rice is N . it ' s enough for N N N meals for an average guy like me . the chicken is delicious and get the pickled veggies ! 
i love their chicken dish with vodka sauce . its like chicken parm with vodka sauce instead of marinara . why didn ' t anyone else think of that sooner ? ? its delicious and they give you a huge portion easily enough for two or N people so its a great value . i honestly don ' t love their pizza but all of the other food i have gotten from here has been great . ( there sauce is really fresh which makes everything taste good ) i also love the people who work there . they are always friendly which gives the place a great neighborhood feel . 
i love me some pies n thighs . a must go to when im in nyc . the butter pecan doughnut is to die for so are the biscuits and gravy . you must check out there brunch sooooooooo yummy ! 
i usually don ' t travel far past washington avenue for dinner but after the reviews i had to try this place . i went on a thursday night and it was unusually crowed but then again there was a net ' s playoff game going on . they allow you to pick your seats so we took a table by the bar with a good view of the tv . the first thing we were told once seated was that they were out of cornbread , sweet potatos and the jambalaya . yikes ! everything i wanted to try . so we settled on gumbo fil , and the shrimp creole . we also got an assortment of blue point oysters as the appetizer . they had a decent selection of draft beers and a decent cocktail menu . the draft beers came in giant chalices . the appetizer came very late , but it was worth it . they came with horseradish , cocktail sauce and creole mignonette sauce . they also served us N instead of N , not sure if it was a mistake or if they were trying to undo the wait time but either way , it didn ' t stop us from eating them . our meals came while we were still finishing up our appetizer . both large portions . the shrimp creole i found lighter and more refreshing , the gumbo fil was a little heavy and the sauce was bland . the shrimp in both dishes however was cooked perfectly . we didn ' t have dessert but i was intrigued by the special dessert ( not on the menu ) of key lime cheesecake . i would go back , but please have the jambalaya ! 
i have lived in the south for nearly N years , so believe me when i say that amy ruth ' s food is not only authentic , but some of the best that i have ever had . i had the rev . al sharpton fried . the chicken was very crispy and the waffle very light and airy . perfect . for a place in new york , their prices are reasonable . someone else mentioned the sweet tea being extremely sweet . that is true , but that is how sweet tea is supposed to be ( at least in the south ) . i also dilute mine too . the service was friendly , but a tad bit slow ( the restaurant was not busy at this time ) . that is my only real complaint . i did order the banana pudding , which was awful . they used store-bough banana pudding ( you should always make a vanilla custard ) , which tasted like banana-flavored laffy taffy . this is not how banana pudding is supposed to be made . overall , great place . i would go there again . 
i am a long time customer of this site back to when it was millenium from N and then brew ha ha . it is very comfortable there . the only thing is they should have varied pastries and additions and changes over time . 
carmine ' s is the best ! had dinner here last night on a saturday night . the place was rocking , they were very very busy our server was awesome enjoyed our meal thanks again , and never disappointed
first off , the food is really good here , and the happy hour is a steal -- you get lots of the best things on the menu for just N each , and the portions aren ' t even that small . the corn with coconut is a great combination , and the kobe beef slider was surprisingly flavorful and nicely charred -- and even big enough to share . but here ' s the thing about the happy hour . the sign says N cocktails -- yet when you actually order the cocktails on the happy hour menu , guess what ? they ' re not N ! the waitress , when asked about this , said there is in fact one cocktail that is N at happy hour -- but she had never mentioned it and it doesn ' t appear on the menu . wtf ? ? ? also , i ' ll confirm what others have said about the weird and diffident service . our server actually seemed to be on something , dazed and ditzy , couldn ' t make eye contact , big saucer eyes . she asked us about dessert and the check before all the food came , clearly didn ' t put in all our order and covered up by saying those dishes take a long time ( one tiny lamp chop takes N minutes ? ) . the food in cc has gotten so much better over the last N years , and the service just hasn ' t kept up -- it ' s an ongoing problem , and i wonder how to fix it . 
good f king sandwiches . need i say more ? 
always awesome food . always awesome drinks . it ' s not papa johns , so they aren ' t piling buckets of cheese on top of your pizza , it ' s not pizza hut so you aren ' t getting giant ice laden glasses of water . it ' s artisanal food , and is served as such . brunch there is especially delicious . 
i would say avoid this place . i met my girlfriend one night here for dinner last week . she got there before i did . . . and was standing in front of the place when i got there . i think that she had enough sense to know what we would be in for with this restaurant . anyway , we decided to go inside because the specials sounded interesting . this place is tiny . there basically N-N people crowded into one corner , with the other side basically empty with a reserved sign on the ' table ' ( which is not really a table , it is just a piece of wood next to the window . when the guy sitting inside there said to me ' it ' s all good ' . . . i knew it wasn ' t going to be . so we ordered the two specials , the lamb shank and black sea bass , which were both very tiny , inadequate , and not particularly tasty . the sea bass which my girlfriend ordered was wrapped up in a piece of paper and was basically tasteless . the excuse for lamb shank was very small and not too flavorful . we were basically through with the meal in N minutes and on our way home , where we cooked some tasty pasta . i would say it you are looking for a couple of snacks , and place to hang out , bring some beer or wine , and get cozy with a friend in some close-up quarters , this is place to go . . . but otherwise , this is not a restaurant . . it ' s just some weird hangout . kind of surprising also because when we got there they were cooking up a storm in the back , but nothing seemed to really come out . the burgers that people next to us ordered looked pretty good , with nice fresh chopped meat , but nothing out of the ordinary of standard diner fare . 
first time there was this monday . when i sat down i was a little underwhelmed by the atmosphere and by the prices . main fish course were N-N dollars . so , i was very skeptical . service was great ! the oysters were very reasonable at N . N each and were fabulous . the menu is very small , but that can work for you and against you . it is a sign usually that everything is fresh and prepared one meal at a time . well the food did not disappoint . my halibut and the vegetables that accompanied it were as good as it gets . i was told this is as good as it gets for fish and i have to agree . this place is as good as it gets when it comes to fish . my only other tip was to check the menu first . there isn ' t going to be something for everyone . but if you find something you like i am comfortable in saying you will love it ! 
the oldest nd best in south philly for roast beef sandwhiches ! over N years i have been eating thier and never got a bad cut of beef ! 
ate here in november N . the service was decent , but the food not impress . the foie gras and octopus appetizer were probably the best things anyone in my group had . the venison dish and autumn vegetable tajine were mediocre at best . the way that it also positions itself as a find dining option when the food quality is so low also grates . 
after witnessing a server ask a pregnant woman to get up so two young men could sit down , i will never ever go back . terrible . 
so we have been anticipating a trip to a . kitchen as we were looking to enjoy bryan sikora ' s food once again . we were wholly disappointed that while his name is still listed on the website , he apparently hasn ' t been employed there for N months . sadly , the food did show the lack of his direction , it was one dimensional at best , no depth . the mushroom tart was much too peppery . we also found the restaurant much too loud with too many hard surfaces . when i asked for another glass of the same wine i already had , by name , i was given the wrong wine , twice . 
sunday brunch at little owl location - great . ambience - fabulous . brunch menu - limited . food - mediocre service - unfriendly ( except at the end when our bill was presented ) would i go back ? - no . 
Nrd time and still great . had the sake box , would have been great if i had a square mouth , stick to the carafe ! 
N N N i love the decor of this resturant . they sometimes have a dj playing cool music the drinks are really good too . this place kind of got over populated so it is hard to just walk in on an evening and get a table . my favorite dish is the pak kraitum veggie dish . . i will order it over and over and over
recently took a business trip to philadelphia and a friend took me to the mcgillin ' s olde ale house . its located on a side street and easy to miss if you don ' t know where you going . has a great beer selection and the bartenders were friendly . if you in philly is worth going there for just one beer . 
sometimes , i don ' t wanna cross myrtle to go out to eat . f-it , sometimes i don ' t even wanna cross park . the food is great at il porto . whether for a slice , a pie , or an entree -- yummy yummy in my tummy . the desserts are hit or miss . sometimes they have live music , which i ' m not crazy about , but it ' s not a bad thing . i forgot to mention , brunch here is randomly awesome ! ! my mamma and i sat outside , it reminded us of old school carroll gardens red hook -- a very italian restaurant juxtaposed with the industrial . i love the outdoor seating , it ' s weird ! ! pro tip -- don ' t get brick oven pizza delivered . what do you expect ? ? 
thank god there was a long wait for the restaurant across the street which forced us to eat here . let me tell you , i ' ll keep coming back . the service , atmosphere , food , and wine is far superior than the other place . my only concern is that once people realize how superior this establishment is , there will be a long wait to get in . as a vegetarian the octopus dish looked and smelled so good i was tempted to taste it . the bulgar salad was to die for and the aged feta , that ' s was an omg ! the dumplings just melted in my mouth and my taste buds sang with joy . a must , must , must ! don ' t deny yourself of good really good food ! ! ! 
my favorite pizza in the city ! hands down great value , great service . i highly recommend delivery as well ! 
great pizza , every damned time . which explains those ridiculous lines . nb , when i got here at Npm on a weeknight with my kids , i walked right in and was seated , and was absolutely not rushed to leave to open up a spot for any of the N people waiting in line at N N when we left . compared to sally ' s , i ' d say pepe ' s has slightly better pizza and far , far better service . as in , they are actually nice to you at pepe ' s . 
had dinner here twice last time i was in the city . the grilled calamari is not to be missed . any of the pasta dishes are great , the sauces are fantastic also . 
it was good but i dont think it was truly great . many of the dishes seemed a bit to disparate - tons of different ingredients thrown together and not always working in total harmony . the dishes were properly cooked and served in a timely fashion , the drinks were outstanding and the service was good . i just think they reach a bit too high and dont let the signature ingredients speak for themselves as much as they should . overall i liked it but i dont think its quite N stars , but im glad i tried it and its definitely one of the better restaurants in the area . 
i have been to bocca lupo twice , and both times i was satisfied . i wasn ' t wowed by the food , but it did taste good . the first time i came i got the macaroni and cheese . it came with mushrooms , which i didn ' t see until it came , so that sort of annoyed me because i am not a fan of mushrooms . the mac and cheese itself was very good though the second time i came i got the risotto with roasted almonds . it was very good . the risotto was a little tart but because the almonds were there it was balanced out . the only thing i didn ' t really like were the very small food portions . 
i went here with a group of friends on a friday night . we made a reservation earlier in the day . it was a small , albeit cozy and energetic . we basically ordered cocktails and appetizers . i ordered the quiet storm which was a little sweet but pretty good . i also ordered the billionaire cocktail which i didn ' t like as much but the ready fire aim was my favorite drink . apps bacon-wrapped lamb chops-awesome . order medium well . i think we ordered N orders ( N of us ) . still tasted the lamb and the bacon didn ' t overpower the taste . bone marrow poppers- pretty good but a little greasy for my taste . the combo was interesting but good . steak tartare- my favorite . they made it spicy and it was probably the best steak tartare i ' ve had . fyi , the menu spelled " tartare " incorrectly . not sure if intentional , ha . charcuterie- standard , nothing special . burrata salad-very refreshing for the pallet . overall , good place for drinks and apps . i would probably recommend this as more of a happy hour place for apps and drinks but that ' s just me . i ' ll definitely return . 
i don ' t know if it ' s just mean , but it seems like whereever i go in greenpoint , the food quality is high , and so is the service ! selamat pagi means good morning in malay indonesian apparently . so you can find some nice indonesian and south asian specialties here . if you haven ' t had vegen tempeh before i highly recommend you try it . theirs was marinated in tamarind which i have tried at thai restaurants before and didn ' t love . but here it is really delicious . out of this tasty . the decor here are these nice wood benches , sliced out of the length of a tree . the walls are painted this soothing white , and the ambiance is really chill . music was a little dfa goodness from lcd soundsystem . friendly staff . definitely will go back . 
this place is a gem ! ! they have the cutest backyard ! ! ! im more upset that they just opened up and summer is almost over . . . the owners came over and introduced themselves and made sure we were doing well - its cozy , and feels like home - and the food is good . . . what more can you ask for ? things you must order N . fried green tomatoes . . . seriously . . . beyond delicious . . . i thought fried green tomatoes was an urban myth . . . . comes with a creamy garlic dipping sauce . . . N . mac and cheese balls- amaze-balls ! ! ! also comes with some yummy dipping sauce but they are just pure perfection- we loved them so much we had N orders of them . . . N . hush puppies - theres nothing quiet about these puppies- they are so bold in flavor - perfectly seasoned and cooked . . . N . tuna tartar- what ? seriously ? so random- we were more interested in what we were gonna be served . . well , im happy to report , it was a five star tar-tar ! ! so fresh - a few ingredients that i wasn ' t expecting in a tartar like an egg , but the flavors fused perfectly ! ! 
bottom line it sucks . . . owner is racist . . . food is not that good . . . wait time is too long . . . not enough seating area . . . did i mention the owner is racist
food was ok , service delivery was terrible . ordered carry-out in the store ( N plain fingers , N general tso , N buffalo maple , N salted caramel , truffle fries and N sauces ) . when we arrived home , the N plain crunchy fingers were missing from the bag . called to request they be delivered ( i live N blocks away ) and they promised to send them . over an hour later , nothing has arrived , no phone call , no refund . the N fingers we did receive were ok , but not amazing . way better cheap eats in the area ( is it still cheap when you pay for two meals but receive N ? ) with better service--highly recommended to look elsewhere . update manager contacted me the next day to apologize , commiserate and offer a refund credit for next visit . two more stars for great follow-up ! 
it suppose to be quick lunch place . but we ordered our food and waited for N min to get our food , its not like they were super busy or something . finally the food came and it lacked all the aroma and punch and didn ' t taste good . their new slogan in the front says fresh menu may the menu might be fresh but the food ! don ' t waste time at this place
the food is amazing in this place . starting with the tortilla chips with guacamole , to the sea bass tacos - taste , presentation and service is great . the environment is sophisticated with reasonable prices . be sure to visit if you are in downtown pa . 
this place was amazing . we live very close but never thought to try it . i was checking out the reviews for another local restaurant and came across the yelp reviews for thai stories . the food was fresh and delicious ! our waitress was lovely and the food was so reasonably priced . ( we left a N tip to make up for the cheap prices ) . we will definitely be back ( and soon ) . 
i guess their prices could be a bit lower , and the ridiculously bad customer ergonomics of the space - waiting in line is an acquired skill , as you have to know when to push to the front and order , and then how to hover just close enough to hear your order without blocking the other customers ! but the box lunches more than make up for it all . the best fries in princeton . and so friendly . 
just called to place an order for takeout , was told they do not do takeout . possibly a great place , but i won ' t be finding out tonight . please change the info on the page . they do not do takeout . 
couscous was no good . 
too bad . . . was a great place once , but since this summer food has gone way down . . . ie . pizza delivered half-cooked and cheese topping comes watery . phone order takers incompetent and rude . moving on and searching for new place . . . . i hear ruthie ' s in montclair makes a yumo coal-oven pizza . . , yum ! ! 
as good as it gets ! 
i love this place ! the food is fantastic and the menu is updated frequently . i enjoyed bluebird at their previous riverside location and am pleased they made the move to a more convenient location downtown , even if they sacrificed a little of the ambiance of the old location . we ' ve been in for their sunday brunch , new lunch , and dinner and have enjoyed them all . . . not to mention the oysters ! 
we went there last night for my son ' s Nth birthday . the place was nice . staff was friendly . Nst off . . . after we all got there and ordered our drinks , we then had to call the waitress back to order our apps . . . we had to wait a while and then she comes back to say she ' ll take our order after our apps get to the table . well that never happened . . . our apps arrived and then N min later she comes by to take our order . . . but midway says . . . hold on and goes off to get something for another table . . . she comes back to finish taking our order . . . now we were not in a rush , but to take someones order after the apps were brought to the table , eaten and cleared away . . . we had to always find someone to refill our drinks . . . and the food was just ok . . . not the best that we had , just ok . . . we will not be going back there anytime soon . . . they need to work on their service . . . 
what a fun place . weekends are crowded and noisy . food here is very good . the gelato is the best i have had . bought fresh pasta which was excellent . the variety of prepared and packaged foods is first rate . the energy for a foodie is simply fun . 
probably my most favorite restaurant on the east coast . you have to plan in advance to get a seat here ! 
geno ' s is so gaudy it makes me sick . the neon lights do not belong in south philly . . . or maybe even the east coast in general . geno ' s is a little cleaner , in both sandwich and establishment , but like caitlin said , a philly cheesesteak shop should be unassuming . . . like pat ' s . i do not care how long the line is at pat ' s , i will never cross the street and enter the " passyunk strip . " 
there ' s always a line here when i come but it ' s always worth it ! come with a group of friends so you can share the order and not feel bad about finishing the whole bag of frites . for the sauces , i personally like peanut satay , sweet mango chutney mayo , and sundried tomato mayo . they make the frites even better . but it ' s always fun to try new flavors and see which ones you like . 
i have been here a few times since moving to nyc over a month ago . up until my visit today , i loved this place . the food is consistently great . i decided to bring two friends from out of town here for lunch . it took about N minutes just to get water and we had to flag the waitress down for it . i let it slide because we were in no rush . the service was quite average for the rest of the meal . the total bill ended up being N . N after tax and we left N thinking that a N tip on the pre-tax amount was reasonable . once we got outside , we were rudely confronted by our waitress who proceeded to educate us about tipping etiquette in front of a crowd of people lined up outside . this was embarrassing and completely unnecessary . hope losing a repeat customer was worth the extra N my friend tossed her so she would stfu . 
good food ! basically a bit better than chipotle next door . the only difference ( hence the Nstars ) is the ear bleeding hip hop music . just consistently and aggressively loud . 
love the fact that i can add my soy milk without paying an additional . N or whatever it is that many other cafes charge . and i love the N N price goodies after Npm . 
one of my favorite spots to bring clients and friends . stephen starr does a great job with this restaurant . my only knock is it can be quite noisy , and at times is hard to get a reservation . i would go back anytime i get a chance . 
everything was amazing ! ! ! from cocktails to apps to dishes sides . we were too stuffed for desert ! our waiter , craig , was outstanding . he has been with the restaurant since it opened and knows the dishes inside and out . his presentation was impeccable and enthusiasm clearly apparent ! all in all , an awesome dining experience ! 
my favorite sushi place in the area . chef o is friendly and great , the food and atmosphere are great as well . our department from ccsu comes here often to have get togethers . definitely eat here ! 
a-ok is exactly how i would describe this . probably N . N stars ( i round down because it ' s just not as good as my N-star places ) . i love the concept . it ' s really nice to be able to go out to a restaurant and have legitimately healthy and wholesome items on the menu . their ingredients have always seemed to be of quality , which i also appreciate . i ' ve had a lot of their vegetables and their salmon sandwich , all of which have been great and taste just like a home cooked meal . however , that ' s what it is , a meal you could ' ve probably made pretty easily at home . as much as i love eating out , one thing that always detracts from a place is when i feel like i could have made it at home . and i ' m not talking about making it at home in the sense that anyone could make a michelin-worthy meal with the right equipment , time , and recipe or even that the recipe itself is easy . i mean home cooked in the sense that it ' s a weeknight , i ' m exhausted , so i just throw some veggies in the pan with some sauce and call it dinner . 
two stars for service . food was way too salty . two of us spent N for lunch without drinks and had to have lunch again . 
tourist trap ? yes . worth the wait ? no . the pizza here is good , but not amazing to justify waiting over an hour . i ' ve been here a couple times and generally , their pizza dough is soft , but also a bit burnt and ashy on the bottom . tip if you get too many toppings it will get soggy . pizza comes out hot and fresh from the oven , so be careful not to burn yourself . i like to take my tourist friends here for dinner then along the promenade at night to see the manhattan skyline while enjoying ice cream . 
it was cold , rainy and miserable today , so a hot bowl of steaming ramen was the perfect pick-me-up . i don ' t know why almost all the japanese ramen in manhattan has to be sold in a hole in the wall , but this joint did not deviate from the standard so try not to go with more than N people . the minca siu ramen i got was okay for the N it cost . it ' s difficult for me to appreciate N ramen when i can make the instant version at home for N cents . but the fatty pork was totally worth it , buttery and melted in my mouth . my friends got the whole wheat ramen noodles which were the first i ever heard of , and they were quite tasty . if you like spicy definitely get the spicy ramen broth , N times better than the regular . overall , not a bad place to go to if ippudo or menkui-tei are busy . 
my boyfriend and i went there last saturday . we had no idea how packed it was going to be . we had to wait for N hour and N minutes . the wait went by quickly because we had delicious white wine sangria at the bar . the red wine sangria wasn ' t too bad either ! we ordered the pork and fish tacos . the fish tacos were amazing . cooked perfectly and served with two very yummy dips . the service and staff were very friendly and always checked in to see if we needed anything . overall , N stars ! also , there is very cute outdoor seating in the back . great for a date night or girls night out ! 
dare you to find a better joint for fried dumplings . triple dog dare you . 
great place for a romantic setting ( although ' romantic ' wasnt my intention here , it could be ) . also , excellent place for attentive service . good place for a quality dish but avoid the shrimp grits ( bitter , too spicy , disappointed ) . my friend ordered this and she didn ' t finish it . she enjoyed a lot of my meal because of it . i ordered the rum soaked duck breast which was great , the creamy yucca turned me ( and my friend ) to addicts of it . my only complaint was the waiting time . you ' re likely to wait N minutes past the time you reserved . the overly crowded bar will be offered to you as you wait but you ' re better off standing . however , calling has its perks . you ' ll receive better seats . 
been there several times and each time the food gets better ! the staff is beyond professional . can ' t wait it take friends and family there . 
the tasting menu was amazing , every dish was quality . the egg and red snapper dishes were highlights but considering the level of quality here , any dish could arguably be someone ' s favourite of the night . the service was very attentive and made the whole experience comfortable . the dishes were well-paced and sized perfectly to make you satisfied but not exploding , something lots of tasting menus get wrong . other people correctly noted that there ' s very little korean influence despite the restaurant ' s genre . i can understand how others could be disappointed , the room ' s decor and the food felt more like le bernardin than korean . . . until they get the food and it ' s so good it transcends that concern . 
good stuff , i say ! a warm , inviting room ( it ' s that georgian brick-colored wall behind the bar that does it all ) and a delicious brooklyn pennant ale were a great beginning to what was a wonderful meal . the cold spring pea soup is delicious ( if a bit overpriced for the quantity served ) , and the dandelion greens salad , with its citrusy vinaigrette and serrano ham , is fantastic . my boyfriend had the salmon and quinoa , and it was a nice piece of salmon - the quinoa was very good . i had the rabbit leg with the mushroom and ricotta ravioli - my boyfriend was jealous at how awesome it was . the rabbit was perfectly prepared - juicy , flavorful and a crisp skin . so good . staff is great - attentive , but not fussy . ( that ' s a good thing ! ) they ' re the kind of people you want to know . 
delicious food and great service ! pizza is amazing , great beer selection , and awesome and friendly staff especially chris she rocked ! liked it so much i returned two days later with my roomies . also love the fact that they dont allow strollers in their establishment ( the one place in park slope to escape the bitchy stroller mafia ) 
food service was very paced as well . nothing came out to quickly , but these are definitely dishes you need to eat slowly and savor . the ambience of the restaurant reflects it earthy , wood panels , dim lights . the food was excellent . even though it lacks the ingenuity of some of the top-end restaurants , everything was delicious . 
pricey , stuck up , unfriendly . didn ' t stick around long enough to give our hard earned money to a rude atmosphere . 
love genos ! best cheesesteaks i ' ve ever had ! 
was so great to discover this place . it ' s right next to where i get my hair done . they have an amazing lunch special soup and half a sandwich for around N ! so worth it . food is super healthy , filling , delicious and place is casual and quiet . i will definitely return for dinner when i ' m in the area again . 
amazing wine selection
always a long wait but absolutely worth it for the delicate , melt in your mouth deliciousness ! 
not a michelin star restaurant but everything about pies n thighs is N star . although the biscuits , the fried chicken and the mac and cheese are heart attack city , you must have them . like a fiend . 
i would say this is a ok place to grab some cantonese style chinese food and dim sums . nothing too impressing though . 
okay i ' m a filipino food novice , but the combo of service , attention to detail in preparation , and freshness makes for an outstanding dining experience to my admittedly " white boy " boy palate . try the sisig , the all day breakfast . . . or my fav the sinagang ( with prawns salmon ) . tasty . 
love this place . the owners are so effin cool and super nice . the food and baked goods are always so amazing and super fresh . ive been here several times and im never disappointed . 
awesome crew working here ! food was great and prices were fair . perfect spot for date night or hanging out with friends . authentic dominican food is just what the doctor ordered . outdoor seating during the summer months completes the package . 
great , intimate date spot . quiet music and low , attractive lighting . prices totally reasonable . i had the red cabbage salad and my bf had one of the sandwiches . we also had a pretzel . the salad was awesome . various beers on tap . loved it ! 
nice and old fashioned staff service good pizza ! prices are good and although the size is small the pizza is tasty
haven ' t been there but highly recommend it based on the reviews . i will say that the pork buns can be a bit dry but the ramen more than makes up for it . good for a romantic evening or just a fun night out with friends
we come here for sandwiches a lot , and they ' re always good ! it bothers me that lettuce , tomato and onion dont come standard on all sandwiches ( you have to ask for it ) but otherwise deli meats and bread are always fresh ! bagels are good here too . the bf always gets their coffee cake ! 
just like miranda . . i also had the pleasure of walking in and was greeted by ms jay with a smile and she asked for my order and i told her this was my Nst time here and she went thru with well we got to let you taste a few things ( smile ) i then made a order for my husbands Nth bday which was on dec N N and i ordered penn vodka with spinach . . . bbq chicken wings . . . . honey garlic chicken . . . . mixed vegetables which consisted of cabbage . . brocc . . mushrooms . . carrots . . it was delicious . . . and the potatoe salad was awesome . . . her food is very spicy and my guests loved it . . . i recommend the grilled chicken palace and i will be using them for other parties in the future . . . thank you ms jay . . . . job well done . . . . . . . 
i ' ve passed it several times and it always looked interesting . clearly someone with deep pockets spent a lot on the interior so finally today i stopped in . the interior was beautiful and i loved the fireplace . the crowd at the bar was a bit salty for the downtown area but i decided to pull up a chair and get down to eating and drinking . the bartender was really helpful in helping me to find a beer i liked - she poured a few samples and that ' s something i really appreciate . i had the calamari , which was almost certainly sysco , known for its frozen , pre-made , edible but uninteresting food . then i decided to try something new and got the guinness pot pie . it ' s basically a guinness beef stew with a pastry crust baked on top . after getting past the crust i found a bowl of gravy ( which was pretty good gravy as it goes ) and small chunks of extremely tough , flavorless meat . i think there may have been a few onions in there . it was pretty terrible basically and for N . N , i dunno . downtown cash-cows are common enough so i ' m not that suprised , and i ' m fairly sure that i ' d get the same level of food ( and probably almost the excact same menu ) at black bear , wicked wolf , or cask republic ( all within a block ) , but , the term gastropub drew me in , thinking i ' d be getting something better . oh well , duped again . bartender was nice though ! 
invited by friends to this amazing place with lot of vegeterian dishes on the menu . . very innovative , palatably delicious and visually very attractive dishes . . busy busy super busy all d time speaks abt d ambience of d place . . i love the roasted carrot and avacado salad . . 
my friends joel and lela have been raving to me about alyan ' s , so when i was recently in the area i decided to swing by for lunch . the restaurant is basic and no-frills , a great spot for lunch or a quick dinner . i had the chicken kabob platter which came with a small salad , some grilled veggies , hummus and pita . i asked to sub tzatziki for the sesame sauce but they didn ' t have any made up , so i asked for a side of hot sauce instead . good call there , because their hot sauce is homemade and very tasty . the chicken was juicy and flavorful and i enjoyed stuffing it into the pita with some hot sauce and hummus . the side salad wasn ' t anything exciting . i would have preferred a side of tabbouleh . still , when all was said and done i was stuffed and had no guilty feelings since everything was relatively healthy . next time , i ' m hitting up the fries everyone seems to rave over ! 
had a very nice , pleasant dining experience . my date ordered glazed chicken with rice and asparagus , which he enjoyed , and i very much enjoyed my pasta penne with vodka sauce , peas and mushrooms . we ordered dinner early - about N p . m . the spikey-haired waitress was lovely , friendly , accommodating and wished us a happy new year . we were given good service , but not rushed along and asked if we needed any alternatives to what we were given as well . a very well-rounded dining experience . i would return . 
this is the best sandwich shop in the burlington and surrounding burlington areas around ! do not be fooled by the posers around . . . the vermont sandwich company has nothing on this place as it uses presliced bread and not homemade bread and still can ' t get the red onion sandwich right ! try the honey oat bread with the namesake sandwich . . . sundried tomato mayo , house roasted turkey , bacon , apples , onions , smoked cheese . . . heated ! and it doesn ' t stop there . . . all the breads are home made and if you can roast a meat it is done right on the premise . all salads , soups , bake goods , cookies ! ! ! ( try theml ! ) are made and baked there ! critics be warned , often times bakerie ' s say items are baked there , but are they actually made there ? you need to go here not only is the signature sandwich always perfect , but the " normal " sanwiches are too ( and the red onions " normal " sandwiches are still sooo phenomenal and large ! ! ! ) . 
our favorite place ! ! we will be back soon ! ! ! wait is very long but food is delicious ! ! 
i used to love this place but not anymore . last time i was here i realized that the product is lower in quality . as i was eating the chicken n ' rice their was a lot of yucky ligaments and bones in the food . i cannot recommend this place anymore although i used to be a big fan . 
the cerviche here is the best . large pieces of squid , octopus and scallop over a fresh salad with fresh avocado and coated lemony spicy dressing . it could almost be an entree , but then you wouldn ' t get to try the roast chicken . this hell ' s kicthen location is reasonably close to nearby theaters , but quite a hike from the subway . the interior looks like the inside of a crate and barrel catalog and peruvian alcohol pairs very well with the cerviche and roast chicken . 
new york offers so many different restaurants , how is one to choose . i want to eat at them all ! somehow i think " all " is almost impossible , especially since i ' m not a local . with that said , i ' m sure going to try for " all " ! a girls gotta have goals after all . my first night in new york and bf treated me to a night out at gramercy tavern . i knew reservations were full since i did my research the week or so before . i was pleasantly surprised that around N N on friday night we were able to snag one of the last tables on the tavern side . we started with cocktails and i opted to start with the jalisco pear with herradura blanco tequila , pear liqueur , allspice dram , and lemon . it was perfectly balanced and had the right amount of sweetness that kept me craving sip after sip . we were on the east coast so i couldn ' t resist the oysters , and we had to try both preparations , two iced and two roasted . both preparations were exquisite , the iced ones were served with a flavorful mignonette that i wanted to drink as a single shot . the other two oysters were lightly roasted and were served warm with a pesto like sauce that made each one sensational . next was the fluke tartare with radish , kumquat and trout roe . since we were sharing all the dishes for the evening they split the dish for us , a nice touch if you ask me . the fluke had a wonderful citrus essence throughout and was complimented by the thinly sliced radish and trout roe . we kept on going with the appetizers and shared the duck liver mousse with pickled vegetables and grilled bread . we received a generous portion of creamy duck liver mousse with crispy grilled bread . we enjoyed each bite as we slowly spread each piece of bread with the luscious mousse and varied each bite with a different pickled vegetable . we kept the evening moving and made our way to entrees . we opted to share the cobia with king trumpet mushrooms an oat risotto and bok choy . i was curious about the nontraditional use of oats to make a risotto and how the whole dish would come together . the cobia was flaky and moist and the king trumpet mushrooms added an earthy note . the oat risotto was a stand out and was a wonderful vessel for the entire dish . the whole dish was well thought out and executed with every detail in mind . we couldn ' t end the evening without dessert and thankfully we both eyed the same dessert on the menu , the lemon pudding cake with pinenut nougatine , yogurt and rosemary . i want and need this recipe so badly , the lemon pudding cake had a moist cake texture with a rich lemon flavor . the pinenut nougatine added superb texture to the entire dish . i cannot emphasize enough how tantalizing this dish was . we scraped the plate clean wanting to find every last morsel of cake . the menu and the food are sensational and that alone would keep me coming back here for years to come . the service was impeccable with everyone working in unison and taking care of each patron as if they were part of large family . 
once in a lifetime experience - unless you go back for more as we did ( provided you can navigate their less than intuitive facebook page to buy tickets ) as others stated , this is not just a meal it ' s an experience way beyond that , including participating in a performance . the courses add up to a trip half time travel - half trip inside into your limbic system . you don ' t need to follow my advice , but i recommend skipping the wine pairings they are very good but i enjoyed the trip more fully sober . 
my friend and i really enjoyed dining here . it was a great vibe , really huge bar scene . we went around N N and were seated promptly . the nachos mama ' s were amazing ! ! ! a must try . they had a variety of food to choose from . i also got the enchilada ' s mixtas . it was delicious and huge . i recommend sharing this entree with two people . my friend got two different taco platters , he loved it ! overall great experience . they even had a black white photo book that you can take pictures in . really cute touch ! definitely give this place a try if you ' re in city center . 
my cousin was raving about these all day . . . so after a dinner in chinatown , we decided to try these as a second dinner . . . and even though we were stuffed from wohop ' s deliciousness , we still managed to pack in N each ! N dumplings for N . . you really can ' t beat that ! they also sell them frozen , and i got N for N . . i ' m pretty sure that ' s the cheapest most convienent dinner i bought in the city . . if you don ' t feel like cooking theyre great to throw on a pan with some sauce ! 
maybe the best dining experience i ' ve had in nyc in years . service was beautiful , friendly , quick , noninvasive , and elegant . the food was well presented , well described , well executed . i had the goat cheese gnocchi ( perhaps a touch salty ) , and blood-orange duck entree ( perfect ) . very , very good . the chocolate bread dessert is not to be missed . i love the whole farm-to-table thing . you feel good about eating there . and after a good bottle of wine , a very nice cocktail , apps , entree , and dessert , tax and tip--we all spent less than N per person . i would have expected it to cost N more . and would have paid it gladly . ( especially since it was my birthday and mollie paid for me ! ) ha . 
it ' s great , but a little too much of a tourist scene for me . i prefer verde coal oven in bushwick . pizza is just as good , and it ' s not so much of a wait . . . 
overrated ! these guys were good at one point , the grandparents created a big name , but as the place got handed down from generation to generation so did the quality of their food . too bad , i used to like it as a kid . 
i went here opening week with two other people - it was a warm , slightly humid evening , and they were very accomodating . we got seated by an open door , so we could people-watch and enjoy the occasional breeze . the food , for the money , is excellent . portion sizes were just about right . grilled menu items were good , as were other main dishes . there is a predominance of porcine items on the menu , as well as several bacon-wrapped items . i ' ve never met a bacon i haven ' t liked - mine was darkly charred ( in a yummy way ) , wrapped over prunes stuffed with walnuts . delicious . the red pepper dip for the bread was also very good - similar to the red pepper dip at scottadio ( in park slope ) , but fresher tasting and chunkier . vegetarian dishes were generic . i think the only main they offered was vegetables with rice . it wasn ' t filling for my vegetarian companion , but he was able to eat several appetizers . there are a few items on the menu featuring " creamy spread . " get the creamy spread . it ' s a thick , very light ( almost white ) colored spread that tastes like it would make a very awesome mac ' n cheese in another form . mmm . 
we went for an early dinner - N people N N . wait staff is friendly and attentive . we started with cocktails and appetizers . the fried olives , hummus and grilled octopus were terrific . the oven fresh pitas served with the hummus ( which tasted freshly ground ) were perfect . the fried olives are surprisingly great bar food . do not miss the cauliflower ! we had the kataif salmon at our waiter ' s suggestion which was perfectly cooked , well balanced and absolutely delicious . others at the table had skirt steak -also a winner . the food is put together thoughtfully and plating was inventive using some slabs of stone for example . overall we were all really pleased with balaboosta . every dish plate without exception was excellent . my only complaint was with my N martini . it ' s not listed on the menu ( and typically standard drinks - gin martini straight up with some olives - aren ' t listed ) so there is no way to have known about this . i really can ' t imagine how a standard size martini could go for N . glad i didn ' t have seconds on that one . 
would potentially be N stars as this place is super adorable , and bonus , is in my building . but as someone who likes my bread and croissants toasted . . . i ' m scewed . the first time i came here and asked for a toasted croissant i was immediately told that it would ruin the integrity ( seriously ) of the croissant and it wasn ' t going to happen . not only did i not get what i wanted but i felt like an idiot who wasn ' t classy enough for this joint ( and i am ) . a couple weeks later , when a friend of mine was singing le pain ' s praises , i quickly went into my rant about croissant integrity . he essentially called me a liar , and in an attempt to prove me wrong , took me to le pain that morning to prove they would in fact toast my croissant . i ' m always right , so it ' s no shocker we heard the same " integrity " story from the sweet waitress who had no idea what she was getting herself into . he is pushier than me , so he told them they were going to do it because they toast their croissants for their sandwiches , so he would like a sandwich , less the sandwich . ( yes the convo got that ridiculous ) . they obliged , but we got a fair warning that it wouldn ' t happen again and they were doing us a favor . a part of me originally thought i was being a d-bag and i ' m the only person alive who wants their croissant toasted , but as we sat there for over an hour we counted N other tables who had the same request ( two for croissants , one for rye bread ) . all patrons were told no . as it appears . . . i ' m not crazy . i do like the feel of this place . i enjoy the coffee . my omlette was wonderful . but you guys have got to relax on the toasting thing or else i ' m gonna have to head next door to starbucks for a sub par croissant just so i don ' t get reprimanded for wanting to heat it up . in fact , when i order a croissant from starbucks they ask me if i would like it toasted . the answer is yes , yes i would ) 
great food and great atmosphere . really friendly waitstaff helped me and my wife on our anniversary dinner . food is really authentic and tasty . falafel and baklava were my favorites . my wife said the salad she had was excellent . 
don ' t let the long winding line drive you away , it moves fast and the food is worth it . my steak burrito was so heavy , and so spicy and tasty , it was unreal . staff was real friendly and the industrial look is cool . 
pretty view , ok food n service . 
bob , i have been a long time fan , patron , and unofficial spokesperson for c . o . jones . however , last night and was met with the horrible realization that parrothead , peach or love potion N margaritas are no longer offered . it appears that nothing else has changed on either the bar menu or food menu . i enjoy the food , but go to c . o . jones for the above mentioned margaritas . please bring them back , i do not even care if the price is doubled . thank you ! 
a very schnancy , fancy korean place . service is impeccable , maybe even suffocating . they are there to fold your napkin if you leave your seat and always around . although we had a problem finding someone to get our check at the end of the meal . ordered a la carte and all the dishes were excellently prepared . skip the cremeux dessert . a lot of attention to detail and they will even print you a special message on the menu if you let them know what you are celebrating in advance . 
i looooooove lucali ! ! ! ! for ambiance is just perfect ! candle lit , old-school italian , with a clean rustic appearance . the chef is often there cooking with his staff right in front of you . you can see them spin the pizza doe and gracefully spread the pristine sauce and decadent cheese on the pie . they also have all of the fresh produce they are using for toppings that day laid out and ready to chop for your individual pizza . i for one am not the biggest calzone fan but i will have at least two servings of theirs ! ! ! it ' s just the best pizza experience i have ever had and you should go ! ! ! 
best bagels in jersey ! seriously , you can count on cleanliness , speed , taste and freshness . one things i love about it the shop is there enormous selection of bagels . bagels like the waffle bagel or the apple cinnamon crunch bagel though they also have the originals as well . their wraps and panini ' s are made fresh and delicious as well . a great breakfast lunch choice ! 
this was one of the worst meals we have had in a long time . slow and inattentive service ( after telling our waiter at N N that we needed to be out by N N to make a N N concert , we were chasing him around trying to give him our credit cards at N N ) , disgusting food that was greasy , overcooked , tasteless and unappealingly served , dirty wine glasses and flies , we decided never to return . there are too many other wonderful restaurants in new haven to waste any time or money at this lousy one . 
everything that i have tried off of their menu has been nothing but top notch ! i am not from the area , but do drive well over N minutes out of my way to get my poor henry ' s fix . i completely understand the charm and quality of this place that locals have known for years . i love how they have a constantly changing beer and food specials menu . i still dream about the sliced steak sandwich with garlic butter on a brioche bun they had as a special a few months back ! all in all , i highly recommend poor henry ' s ! ! 
simply the best , great atmosphere and friendly staff
terrible experience . the owner chef needs to learn about appropriate behaviour with his guests . 
i used to love this place about N months ago , and sent all of my family and friends there . the last time i was there the portions were smaller and the quality of the ingredients were better . it ' s gone down sadly . last two times i have eaten there were a year apart and both times i have thrown up . the servers are nice but the kitchen is unforgivably slow . N down the drain literally . 
great food . owned by the same people who have penangs over in the nassau park shopping center . don ' t ever order delivery from here . they have only one delivery person and they are not familiar with the area . my apartment is a few blocks from the restaurant and the driver spent N min trying to find my place while on the phone with me giving directions . eventually they drove back to the restaurant where i had to pick the food up . 
this byo is my go-to place for italian when friends are in town . the owner and staff make you feel like you are eating at their home . the food is delicious and the portions are generous . i can bring my friends with dietary restrictions here because of their gluten free offerings and i have never had a bad meal here . i strongly recommend . 
great subs ! 
i cannot believe we didn ' t find this place earlier . great atmosphere , with gorgeous wrought iron and antique colored glass bottles . great drinks , with innovative combinations and old classic renditions , offering every spirit under the sun . great food -- we had the bacon-wrapped dates and they were like heaven in my mouth . the thing that ' s really special is the bespoke cocktails . you talk with the bartender about your tastes and preferences , and he makes something just for you . i had a strong , bourbon-based , cardamom-scented drink that was great , and my husband had an incredible drink with rum , frothy egg white , and spices ( nutmeg and cloves , i think ? ) . we ' ll be coming back soon . 
wanted to hit a starr restaurant while in philadelphia and alma de cuba fit the bill for being open on sunday night and having food not to be found at an up-scale eatery in washington dc where i am from . went with a friend after visiting the philadelphia flower show . we were not disappointed . we did the N ceviche dish tasting . each was delicious but i think having individual order of one each ( which would have been larger ) and then sharing would have been better . we did not think they were different enough . we did the yellowtail , scallop and rainbow . my friend had the rum cured duck which was outstanding ! ! ! the side of slaw was rather bland and not " cubanish " in our estimation . i chose the arroz con pollo . best dish i have had in a very long time . very copious and might best be split between two people . the yellow rice w . peas and red peppers was spiced to perfection . the roasted chicken skin was just crispy right . and the egg , well done to be stiff but also allowed to drizzle . the service was excellent . one of the nice things done in this restaurant is on the left hand side of the menu . the entire staff is listed . what a compliment to them ! 
so disappointed ! recommended by u of c friend of my son ' s . it was supposed to be a special treat . chicken overcooked and greasy . service terrible . room manager was very rude . young manager the restaurant was sweet and almost . try sylvias in tears because other girls were giving her so much difficulty
quite a lunch today at escape ! i arrived hungry , having skipped breakfast , and at the advice of my dining companion , we both opted for the prix fixe . at N , it ' s quite a value . the maitre d seated me upon my arrival , and i sat and waited in what was an otherwise empty dining room until my dining companion arrived . while that was a little strange--to not be offered so much as a menu or a glass of water while i waited--it certainly wasn ' t a deal breaker , as it gave me an opportunity to wonder around a bit and snap a few photos . i was surprised that my friend had brought a bottle of sparkling wine that was quickly served , with the remainder put on ice to chill . we were given menus , and were delighted to see a few new additions , such as a hanger steak and a pulled pork . i opted to start with mussels , served in a delightful light broth with just the right seasoning topped with a hint of shaved onion . a delicious change of pace from the usual serving in a white wine or a tomato broth . i followed with a skillet fried chicken--all dark meat--that was seasoned to perfection . the skin was super crispy , while the meat was juicy and tender . i seldom get to enjoy fried chicken that is not simply deep fried , and this was a real treat . the breading , the spicy seasoning , i ' m starting to get hungry for it again as i type ! even the slaw strayed from the traditional mayo base . it was done in a spicy aioli type of sauce , and it packed a bit of a punch--an impressive slaw to say the least . my only regret is that my corn bread side was served as an ap rather than with the chicken . the corn bread was sweet with just the right amount of salt , served up in a basket of about N-N almost a two bite-sized pieces . the only thing that would have been better about the corn bread were if it were to have a bit of fresh corn kernels in to add a little texture . the word i got on the pork belly grits is that it was a dish of rich , buttery goodness , with a nice flavor and consistency . the pork looked to be done just right as well , with a soft , tender texture . they had fried okra today , served in a tempura style , with a spicy remoulade dipping sauce . just the right amount of snap in the okra with a very crisp breading but not overtly oily . good modern take on southern style eating today . a vanilla root beer float in a mason jar , and a sugar coated fudge browny with a coarsely ground mixed nut capped off with a little whipped cream . the fact that we were the only diners at noon does not take away from the fact that the service was friendly and attentive , without being overbearing or intrusive . the only minor hiccup being the corn bread side being served ahead of the apps , rather than along side my chicken , but may just have been my expectation rather than a faux pas . with the changes additions to the menu happening rather rapidly , and the quality of a meal they ' re offering for N , i ' ll be sure to return for lunch , and i ' m excited to try dinner as well . 
the best chinese food around woodbridge-edison area . every dish i ' ve ordered that contains meat comes with a lot of meat . you will def . get your money ' s worth . not to mention that the staff is on their game . they know their customers ( i just got a christmas card from them for crying out loud ! ) and delivery is prompt . 
blue ribbon is ok , just ok . i would not go out of my way to eat here again . the staff was gracious , but i found the timing of the food to be lacking . the food is nothing more than ok . the mixed salad seemed like a handful of the stuff from the box . the steamed artichoke was pretty bland . one of us ordered a steak that was good , but salty . the other ordered salmon , tasty once i found it on the plate . truly it could not have been more than N ounces of fish . the mashed potatoes and fried potatoes were good , but the dish should have been called carbs with salmon on the side . and ok , i know i am not a N something , but it was so damn dark at my table i had to ask for a flashlight to read the menu--and i wasn ' t the first since they in fact had a flashlight . oh and no booze , coffee or dessert , no bottled water and N apps and N dinners was a hundred bucks with tip . 
the best spot for a casual night out . the food is great and the restaurant has kind of a homey vibe . i would deff go back again . byob if you want to drink any alcohol . the beverages they have there though are yummy . the hot ginger tea is great for a winter night . 
the soy milk chili mayo in my roasted cauliflower sandwich is what made my sandwich so tasty . the sauce had a hint of spice and the cauliflower didn ' t even taste like regular cauliflower . the sandwich was of a great individual size and it was very fulfilling . they also use the same sauce for their corn on the cob . so that means , a great side dish to order . 
waiting for our order of N samosas since half n hour now . . . . . and noticing the hygiene around this place standing by their kitchen counter . we see people touching and preparing food without any gloves . a man is eating and serving the dish for the guests at the same time . good luck whoever is being served by him . this place has zero tolerance for take-outs . . . should put a board that ' we do not treat our take-out customers with courtesy and neither will we entertain them once we have billed them ' . people coming after us are being served samosas . . . . but we are still waiting . and finally it arrives in N good mins and we dont want it anymore . 
if you want to taste the best roast beef sandwich ever made then you have to come to nick ' s roast beef in south philly on the corner of Nth jackson sts . slow roasted simmering beef like grandma used to make . it is tender , juicy , delicious , and outrageously great ! just give me a roast beef combo ( roast beef provolone ) xtra wet ( dipped in au jus ) with insane gravy fries ( soaked in au jus ) with a side of broccoli rabe and bammmm ! an explosion of juices in your mouth . my family and i have been going for more than N years and its like home sweet home . trust me when i tell you , when you eat the first one you will not leave without another one to go or eat it right there . they also have a roast pork combo and roast ham combo that are also equally delicious . 
as i parked the car and sent the wife in for a table , i got a text alert that my table would be ready in N minutes . not bad for a sunday brunch . we were sat in N . i always appreciate an overestimate on the wait time . the decor says " ikea " to me , but not in a bad way . i couldn ' t tell if they were seating people at communal tables , but we were lucky to get a great little spot , nestled in the corner . we split the grilled cheese and tomato soup , the meatloaf sandwich , and a bowl of grits . the grilled cheese was a little underdone , but delicious none the less . we payed the extra N for the slab bacon , and it was worth every penny . the soup , while flavorful , was luke warm at best . i can see that this would be stellar if it was piping hot . i would have dunked the gc right in there . the meatloaf was good . a gravy side would have put it over the top . sweet potato fries were well seasoned and delicious . i loved the grits . cheesy , creamy , with " scrapple cracklins ' " fantastic ! from the hostess and who i assumed the owner , not even a " hello " or " thank you " as you walk in or out . our service was spotty at best . would describe it as " melrose-esque " for those of you in the know . our order was taken , our food was dropped , we were given the check . i would have appreciated a check in , or a correct drink refill . ( i had sweet tea , and was given unsweet that i couldn ' t get sweet with the sugar cubes . ) the bussers were the best thing going , as they seemed to be taking drink orders , clearing plates , wrapping food , and thanking people . overall , i liked green eggs . i plan on going back . counter service may be the way to go if you like interaction or refills . 
it ' s mexican food less than a five minute walk from my house . of course i love it ! while there ' s nothing particularly glowing about this place , the food is up to snuff . i ' ve only ever gotten take out from here , but you can sit down and have a typical dine in experience ( for being as good as it is , it ' s never busy which doesn ' t seem good for them , but good for your peace of mind ) . they also claim to have free delivery . i would take advantage of this but considering it ' s so close i ' d feel wrong not getting that short little walk in . i ' ve gotten their veggie burrito ( with lots of delicious vegetables like zucchini in it ! ) and their tamales . they have a great chipotle sauce , too . i can actually finish a whole meal here feeling satisfied , not ready to lapse into a food coma . everything is delicious and fresh and they have it ready to go all wrapped up for you pretty quickly . never had a problem with this place , hope i never do ! 
after hearing amazing reviews from friends , a foodie friend who wanted to experience , joined me in taking my mum who was in town visiting . an innovative and diverse cocktail list started our dinner the celery gimlet was refreshing and smooth . they were able to make an odd cocktail at my mum ' s request to her liking . started with the mushroom pot , which was smooth , creamy and earthy and the hamachi - beef and yellow tail - both fresh , tender and melted-in-your mouth goodness . entrees included the tile fish special , pork chops and filet all perfectly prepared . the brussel sprouts side was delicious , though a tad heavy on the oil and sauce . desserts - the donuts were the big hit airy with a crisp shell , that held up and went perfectly with the vanilla and chocolate sauces . the s ' mores , while fabulous in presentation and concept , tasted like propane ( or what i imagine it tastes like ) , and were disappointing , having been recommended from our waiter . i ' ll definitely go back if not for just grabbing cocktails in the bar area . 
very good meal , excellent service , and skillful wine pairings individualized for our winter tasting menu experience . we were most impressed with the level of knowledge and service coupled with the decidedly unstuffy attitude . would that all fine dining venues valued the simple reliance on quality food and attentive service , and lose the uptight snobish approach . 
pretty good food , the portions are normal sized . i don ' t think pickles are their standout offering even though their name says " pickles " , and there are a variety of pickled items to choose from . i had the fried chicken which came with grits . it was boneless , but the meal was full and satisfying . 
i would have to say pulcinella ' s is by far my favorite restaurant to visit ! the staff is always nice professional prompt . can ' t ask for much more in a restaurant . if you ' re looking for a place with some heartwarming food for the soul then you ' ll have to make a visit here ! i ' ve been quite a few times and i ' ve never left with an empty stomach , and a happy mouth . i had elisabeth as my waitress and she was great from the moment we sat down until we left . the whole restaurant feels kind of like sitting down for a family dinner at a good friend ' s house . i ' ll be sure to be going back soon ! 
love love love jack ' s wife freda , the food is divine , affordable , light and super tasty ! the atmosphere is amazing , young , happening and laid back in the evening , great place for brunch with kids , great place to bring ppl who want to see what a real new york place feels like , love it , too bad im all the way uptown ! ! 
damn you new york city , your ramen is way better than what we have in the sf bay area . you broth is packed with flavors but your portions are smaller and you charge a whopping N a bowl . but man that broth was so good . you are on par with ramen in vancouver . the decor was really modern and a bit too trendy for a ramen house and its close to the ny metro . a definite must try if you are on a quest to try every ramen noodle in the world . next up tokyo , japan . . get ready cause the big one is coming . ok not funny . 
i ' ve been hearing about peaches for the entire year i ' ve lived in the neighborhood and just now made it over there . had i known how good it is , i would have been there first thing . i ' m from the south , so good southern food is important to me . and holy moly is the food delicious . grits grits and more grits . i had a hard time choosing which to get- but i was not disappointed with the broccoli grits . only N and it filled me ! i did have a slice of the cornbread as well , which came out piping hot and fresh . the perfect sweet and salty ratio . i was wishing i had more . i also shared some mac and cheese with my friend and that too was rich and creamy delicious . lastly- try one of their cocktails ! i ' m not a big drinker so one cocktail had me a bit tipsy and it was so so good . ( the rosie p ) i can ' t recommend this place highly enough and i can ' t wait to go back . i went on a friday night so the service wasn ' t super fast but they were busy so i wasn ' t even bothered ! yummmm . 
i can ' t say enough about this place . where to go when you don ' t want to go into new haven , but are still looking for good food ? ibiza . the tapas are absolutely amazing . comparable to tapas i ' ve had in spain . i have been to ibiza several times and tried various tapas each time , and i have never been let down . they are all delicious . the staff is great , with good suggestions . the manager makes it a point to come by and see how your meal is . small and cozy , sometimes a bit loud , but all in all , a fabulous place . oh , and how can i forget the sangria ? delish as well . 
the falafel balls are tasty , the toppings are o . . k chopped lettuce tomatoes , the tahini sauce seemed spliced with mayo , or just kinda bland . i ' m spoiled , i ' ve eaten falafels in the middle east , where pitas are warmer , toppings are more varied . but it really is a deal in this neighborhood , and the island at large . 
the lemongrass chicken is delicious and one of the best values you ' ll find in all manhattan . great service and excellent , flavorful dishes . 
i have never had even close to a bad meal at this lovely northern italian restaurant . from the simplicity of its decor , the knowledge of their staff to the menu of perfectly priced dishes . . . . i love this place . don ' t let yelpers be the judge though , i just read in travel leisure that this restaurant was named top N in the country for italian restaurants . doesn ' t surprise me ! the bolognese is by far the best i ' ve ever had and the duck is done to perfection . 
my family and i have been frequent patrons of raymond ' s for almost N years . our party of N was there for brunch on sunday N N . we first noticed that the menu ' s format had been changed and some familiar dishes were no longer listed . all three of us ordered the migas egg dish and it was inedible ! it was smothered with N cheese on a N egg omelet , chopped up peppers , onions , soggy strips of taco shell and diluted salsa . i was very hungry and made the mistake of eating a little less than half of it , but the other two members of our party immediately complained and asked to have their dishes returned . one of the two in my party had lost his appetite after tasting his dish and passed after the server asked if wanted something else . my girlfriend did take the server up on a replacement and ordered the " safe " french toast . since the migas was prepared so differently from the dozens of times that we had ordered and enjoyed it , i asked the server if the restaurant had hired a new chef ? she confirmed that they did . so i guess that partly explains why the food was so awful . . so about an hour after i consumed the the migas , i started to feel a rumbling in my stomach and sparing ya ' ll the gory details , let ' s just say that i spent the rest of the afternoon dealing with severe abdominal distress in the bathroom ! over the many years that i ' ve frequented this restaurant , the food had been consistently been above average ( for the exception of the over ambitiously prepared mediterranean burger ) . the only consistent complaint that i ' ve had with raymond ' s was the ear bleeding noise level . since the restaurant was designed by the same firm that designed keith mcnally ' s patis and balthazar in nyc there is an abundance of sound reflecting hard surfaces tin ceilings , ceramic tile floors , bare wooden table tops and acres of mirrors lining the walls , the cacophony enabled by all of the sound bouncing off all of these flat hard surfaces is enough to drown out a conversation between people sitting across from each other that in turn causes everyone to end up shouting at each other thus increasing the sound level even higher ! i would also like to take this opportunity to make a suggestion that the owners do something to isolate and reduce the sound of crashing glasses , plates and silverware that occurs just outside the kitchen where the bus station has been set up , as this only adds to the sound level turning it up to the level of unbearable if you happen to be seated anywhere near the back of the restaurant . 
five leaves has the best summer salads in greenpoint . it ' s always a delicious experience when we visit . all year long this is our go-to date spot
actually had my birthday dinner here and i have to say even though i wanted it to be good , in hindsight i just don ' t remember it being good . only memorable dish was the olive cake for dessert ( e . g . , had the ' famous ' suckling pig dish but wasn ' t impressed ) . i also been a couple times after that for brunch and service was atrocious . i wished i had given a zero dollar tip and told management because that ' s how bad the service was there . overrated for the food , service , and price . deserves one star - maybe two for the olive cake . 
food is excellent but the staff is extremely rude and dishonest . our waitress charged us N extra for a beer and when asked why we were charged that much for a beer she rolled her eyes at us . extremely rude employees . if the owner was smart he would speak to his employees asap . 
great ownes good food nice staff i can eat at devina evry day
this place is so good . everything i ' ve had has never left me wanting more . the only thing that would make this better is if you could make reservations , other than that , solid food , solid service
this place is fun ! however , why is everyone so glum ! ? ! ? ! i thought italy is eataly , and last time i checked italy is about eating and celebrating life ! the employees here look like they all just scolded and told they were not getting paid for the year or something ! i swear , not one person had a smile on , even the waiter at the salami and cheese sit down station was moody . he tried really hard to add some inflection to his tone , but i could tell he hated his job . got the cutting board with all sorts of proscuitto and cheeses on it , it comes with a little plate of fig , honey , and candied lemon peel strips . i had no idea what to do with those so i just lapped up the honey with my fingers , classy i know . the bread is extra delicious , and they were ok with giving me extra . i would love to come back and shop , but all the employees just makes me sad ( oh yeah , i also don ' t understand why you can ' t eat something from one station at another station ! 
outstanding prix fixe value . friendly service . terrific arugula salad , roasted char , and tiramisu . i hereby declare paprika as my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood . 
very good sandwich , reasonably priced . i haven ' t tried any drinks yet , but i ' m sure i ' ll be back . i suspect that what a previous reviewer called ' rude ' was a certain brusqueness that people from the country of origin of the women behind the counter are known for . i found them to be perfectly friendly . 
it ' s a bar with food . N stars for beer selection . the food brings it down a star . the food was very salty . the burger was typical pub burger . cooked medium rather mid rare that i asked for . the fries were a bit dead and very salty . ceasar salad was dead as in put under a heat lamp . the guiness stew was reminiscent of stew from a can and was very salty . 
pho thoung lai is definitely a hole in the wall type of establishment . the people here are hard workers who don ' t really understand the key elements of operating a successful pho restaurant that will attract people . i met up with a friend on saturday for a quick bowl of pho . the man who helped us was nice in a cute way . i think he thought i was vietnamese because he supplied us with reading material . now onto the pho , the bowls were huge . tons and tons of broth and meat . the broth was okay imo , i didn ' t like that it was salt based . when i make pho myself i don ' t add salt , i use roots and spices to season the broth . broth that is heavily salt based isn ' t made with care . another thing i didn ' t like about the broth is that i had to put effort into dressing it up before it tasted decent . any pho place knows that if an asian is out having pho they are too lazy to dress up the broth themselves . the broth here reminds me of the pho broth you serve children , bland and uninteresting . the meats were all pre cooked . i have no major gripe but i prefer a mixture of fresh and cooked . bean sprouts could have been a tad fresher . i ' m particular about the freshness of my sprouts , they ' re so cheap at N cents a lb any good restaurant should be able to afford to stock up on fresh sprouts- even if you have to make a daily trip to adongs each morning it ' s essential . i had limeanade and well i think she didn ' t mix it well enough for me because on one side all i can taste was sugar . next time i ' m keeping my N . total bill came out to N a person . not bad but i didn ' t feel photastic afterwards so i won ' t be adding it to my rotation . as much as i like to distribute my earnings evenly amongst the pho joints in the area this restaurant will be low on the list . 
this little bar restaurant is a bit of a speakeasy , if you didn ' t know it was there you might never notice it . i went for brunch on a saturday morning , the meals where delicious , but a little small , pricing was affordable , meals are N-N dollars , coffee is N but there are no free refills . mimosa was N , wine was N-N . the service was really good and the decor was awesome , the bathrooms downstairs make you feel a little bit like you are in a ships hold . it ' s a good place to take a date ( i took my girlfriend ) probably a decent place to go alone , but probably not the best place to go drinking with your buddies . 
don ' t be fooled by " ugly kitchen " because their food and service is anything but ugly . my first time having filipino cuisine and i was in for a pleasant surprise ! the fried pork belly and beef dish ( forgot the names ) were absolutely delicious . the garlic fried rice they serve is too good to be true -- i had to order a second plate of just the rice . the overall atmosphere and vibe here is enjoyable , and the staff here are great . the only downer is that the drink selection is very , very limited and the drinks could be better . but considering they offer happy hour til Npm ( even on a saturday night ! ) , it ' s no biggie . i will definitely be back to try out their burgers ! 
nice place , good service and really good food . . . . the ropa vieja is sooo yummy ! ! 
brunch was quite good . i tried the pumpkin waffles and the omelet . the waffles were good but i wished they had a little more pumpkin flavor . the omelet was excellent . the cider mimosa tasted mostly of champagne . i ' d go back but be sure to get there before N because that ' s when the crowds come . 
everything about this place was great , the restaurant itself is beautiful and very unique i like how the drinks were served in cool little mason jars with homemade toothpicks made out of strands of wicker . they have very interesting appetizers along with small vegetable dishes and an assortment of cheese plates to choose from . we chose to get the secret stash cheese plate which is an assortment of five cheeses and meats that the chef chooses and they were all incredible , every single cheese was described to us in great detail by our server who was incredibly knowledgeable about every single food item it really seems like the kitchen staff make sure that the servers know exactly what they are talking about . we also received a gift from the chef they were caramelized onion rolls with sage butter on top and i actually couldn ' t believe how good they were i was so impresses by this roll it blew my mind . we also had an amazing appetizer which was smoked applewood sausage with a delicious cooked cabbage and with some kind of sauce to go with it . i have to be honest almost every dish on the menu had one or two ingredients that i had never heard of however everything was so good that i just put my trust into the chef and it was definitely a good choice . our entrees were amazingand all the portion sizes are just right , they are not too small as to where you feel ripped off but not too big so you can order several different things and really enjoy everything and not ruin your appetite . the desserts were also incredible my girlfriend had a lemon pudding cake and i had the cookie collection although they were both very small the portion size was perfect because we were both already full but we were so glad we chose the dessert . the ambiance in this restaurant is great it is a great place to bring somebody on a date or a romantic evening . i have told many people about my visit and i plan to tell more ! a ! ! i will definitely return here in the summer for the outdoor seating
the chicken platter is hands down the best lunch deal in midtown . the wait is worth it . 
absolutely delicious ! we ' ve been three times for their southern menu and i really look forward to seeing what the chef comes up with next . as a southerner , i can say the chef ' s interpretation of " mac cheese " called " crack cheese " is some of the best i ' ve ever tasted . the bbq sandwiches , pork sliders and tacos are all perfection . it ' s best to go for an early supper if you have children because there will likely be a wait after N N p . m . so good ! 
generally a very good urban market of its genre , can compare favorably to similar markets in other cities , if not quite to similar markets in l . a . or san francisco , but i wouldn ' t really expect it to . as with any urban market of this kind , it pays to know your food , take your time , and expect some bumps in the road . do not assume that the most popular meat , fish and produce stands ( as measured by the lines ) are the best in quality sometimes that ' s because they ' re running a special , sometimes it ' s just one thing ( one of the meat vendors has great sausage and so-so everything else ) . prepared food in the market is very good to fair , sometimes relative to the region . ( the Nst street cantina , for example , is very good mexican cuisine for the mid-atlantic , but if you ' re from the west or southwest or mexico itself , you may not be that impressed . ) gets very crowded after Nam on weekends or at lunch , especially if there ' s a big convention at the hotel . 
stay away from this place ! very very disappointing ! ! not worth your time and money . terrible service and food . nothing great about the menu items . the pancakes . . . nothing special . my cup of coffee came with red lipstick on it . . . . . gross ! the mexican host was clueless . the place is a joke . it ' s not run by french people . on that note , you can imagine how serious they are with the business . 
the smell of fresh bread when you walk in is amazing . they offer free samples of bread cut at least N " thick . try the cinnamon bread . ordered a chocolate brownie it must weigh N pound . 
do ' nt know what the buzz is about . the server was not very knowledgeable about wine choices , saying an italian supoer tuscan was from napa . appetizers were okay but the mushroom onion soup was overwhelmed by the onion . the big sins ? the main course took just under N hour from order to the table during which time , after appetizers had been served , our server spoke to us only once and that was N minutes before the finally plates came out . the roast chicken was good but not memorable . the veal piccata was simply not good . although the veal was thin and tender , it was overbreaded , and the piccata sauce was dark and heavy , rendering any flavor of veal nearly non-exisitent . we won ' t be going back
cool location . 
i don ' t understand how any one gave less than N stars . this place was awesome . the king roll , one of the special rolls , was amazing . i will definitely be back . 
we finally went to check out pho N today because it was storming and what better rainy day food is there than pho ? ( well , ramen , but you can ' t get that in ct ) . it was about Nam , so we were the only two in the restaurant . we got seated promptly , and upon noticing that my menu didn ' t have the fun food pics , the server replaced my menu right away . food we ordered pho tai , bun bo hue , and egg rolls . the pho tai broth was clean ( not oily ) , but underwhelming . it may have been because we were there so early in the morning , but the broth didn ' t have the complexity depth like other pho broths in the area . the tai ( beef ) amount was fair , and the noodles were perfectly cooked . i also like my pho broth to be super hot , and this was not . the side vegetables were clean , fresh , and a decent amount . bun bo hue also had a simple taste , but there were tons of vegetables to add which helped to deepen the flavor . it even came with a pig ' s foot -- which evidently , my husband likes ( yuck ! ) . the egg rolls were not memorable , but the mushroom taste was overpowering -- but they were perfectly crispy and came with some greens to eat them with , which is something i miss about the west coast style of egg rolls ! ambiance again , we were the only ones in there , but it would have been nice if they turned on the lights in the restaurant for us ? dim lighting for lunch -- not a fan . service simple efficient - they sat us right away , gave us our menus , food came out promptly , checked on us once . value pho tai bun bo hue egg rolls N glasses of iced jasmine tea N including tax . pretty good for ct . we also ordered a banh mi to go , but i haven ' t eaten it yet ( saving it for my husband ' s dinner later ) . while the banh mi was being prepared , we heard the death march bells the sound of a microwave . would i go again ? probably not . decent food and service , but nothing makes me feel like i want to go back here . 
hot damn ! momo exceeded all of my expectations . i showed up alone , expecting to sit at the bar , but there is no bar . it ' s all communal tables at momo . luckily , this wasn ' t a problem at all . the host took care of me and even remembered my face , after i sat down to wait on the benches outside . i really didn ' t know what to expect when it came to the food . based on the menu and the pictures , momo ' s is clearly not a traditional sushi joint . this usually means you ' re dealing with a place that caters to people who like the idea of sushi , but in practice , just order shrimp tempura and california rolls . i quickly discovered that my concerns were unfounded though , as my first dish , a hotate ( scallop ) hand roll , blew up my taste buds . the scallop was fresh and delicate and the preparation worked perfectly in hand roll form . i think i also remember some shiso and a little spicy mayo , which added depth and a nice mouth feel to the dish . i should have ordered N more of them ! every other dish hit the mark as well . i has the kinpira ( braised lotus root ) , the spicy mc bomb and the salmon sea urchin . i would have liked a little more urchin in that last one , but having lived in santa barara , i ' m still getting used to the realities of sushi in a place that doesn ' t produce the best sea urchin in the world . either way , everything was delicious and i wouldn ' t hesitate to order any of the dishes again . the staff was friendly and attentive and the host even offered me a taste of some special salt-cured , marinated and then lightly blow-torched mackerel that he thought would go well with the sake ( suijin ) i ordered at the beginning of the meal . they were perfect together , by the way . it ' s that kind of attention to detail that will keep me coming back . thanks for a great meal , momo . see you next time ! 
gorgeous ambiance . friend had a kale salad and i had the garden omelette , two drinks , coffee , and dessert . bill around N . perfect for brunch . the staff seemed inexperienced , but friendly . 
the pastries are consistently very good , particularly if you get there early for a good selection . they have a cool row of seats facing out the window , with a view of the park across the street , and a nice selection of books to read while sipping your espresso . my wife and i paged the whole way through a book on chinese antiquities while sharing sandwiches and pastries one snowy day , and it was a slice of happiness . there ' s also an art gallery right next door , and some interesting shops nearby . this is a terrific addition to westville . when i want to bring a friend a little treat to say thank you for something , this is where i go to get it . 
can ' t go wrong if you can snag a table . probably the best italian for the price . i ' ve never been disappointed here
catfish tacos and queso dip ! ! yum yum yum ! 
i read previous reviews and i must say i was pessimist . i came into the garden state diner on christmas day and may i say awesome ! i had fresh oatmeal with blueberries and banana ' s and the coffee was excellent . bartender paul really made me feel at home ! portions coming out of kitchen looked humongous and menu is fairly priced ! second time in newark and another great time at gsd ! 
supercilious waiter and day-old croissants--cannot fool a couple of new yorkers . used to like this place for its ambiance , but even ambiance cannot cancel out such attitude . no excuse with its own bakery next door ! 
i appreciate the response . mad props for responding . i think this shows that whoever is making decisions cares about who is in their line if customers . giving more stars for service . look forward to trying . 
great little local place for delicious sandwiches . 
the place is always crowded with tourists and i always find something special for myself in eataly . i love this place . specially pizza counter guy mario - such a sweety . he always treats us with complimentary thngs
we placed our order online and was told N-N minutes , with a price of N . N . when called to check on the order , we were told that they never received the order and would just be starting it now , N minutes after we originally ordered ! when receiving the order finally an hour and a half later , we were asked to sign for N . N . when questioned , the delivery man informed us that if we sign he will honor the N . N because that is what we originally signed for and were told the price would be . when calling the store , the lady was extremely rude and told me " whatever , " you signed for it already and you got your food . i told her this is no way to speak to a customer , and she repeated " whatever , bye . " and hung up on me . i will never be ordering from this restaurant again . there customer service is terrible and they will charge you more than you originally are being asked to pay after you receive your food . disgusting ! 
i have been to park central a few times but not since the recent menu change . tonight i was delighted to see a fresh new menu full of delicious options ! i couldn ' t possibly resist the lobster roll with hand picked lobster meat , and the server let me switch out the fries for a caesar salad ! after enjoying a few glasses of wine i got a bit hungry again and decided to take another glance at the menu . i ended up ordering the date and goat cheese flatbread and let me tell you it was the best decision of my night ! it was absolutely delicious , a subtle lemon vinaigrette with fresh arugula . really great ! i will be back soon ! 
N . N lunch special , good deal , however the main dishes we got ( standard fare , pad thai and drunken noodles ) were not seasoned and very subpar . song is waaaay better , even sea is better . redeeming qualities lunch special includes a drink , i got the coconut which was cool and delicious and usually costs around N-Nbucks on its own . also the tom yum soup was heavenly . 
i ' m a vegitarian and came to americana along with some friends . i was amazed with the ambiance and the service . since i had limited choice i ordered their veg . panini and loved it . just the right crunch and perfect to fill you up for lunch . 
generally solid food and service with a great atmosphere . knocked a star off as i felt my striped bass entree was a little tough . short rib appie was delish though . mushroom and leek side was too mushroomy and not enough leeky for my taste . chocolate brownie dessert good but not out of this world . fairly small portions all around but i ' d go back for the scene . 
delivious restauraunt . the only thing i personally didnt like was the lamb hamburger , it was seasoned with too much black sauce . but apart from that it was great . i loved the kafta and the babaganush
unbelievable beer selection here . they even have an iphone app for their patrons to keep up on the tap list ! unlike some of my other favorite beer spots , its a little more spread out so it wasn ' t ridiculous to move around in there when it got busy . they have alot of tvs so its also a great place to go for sports . if i lived in nyc , i would be here way too much sampling the ever changing tap list . . 
first , the owner came outside while my friend and i looked at their menu . he offered us a N discount . my friend and i agreed . our table was extremely wobbly , causing us to deal with it often throughout the meal . our vegetable pakoras appeared to be only one vegetable , onion . they were over-cooked and tasteless . the chutneys that came with it were in extremely small portions , as if tamarind chutney is worth its weight in gold . and the traditional onion chutney was replaced raita . however , raita isn ' t a dipping sauce or chutney , so that made no sense . and again , it was maybe a single tablespoon of the stuff . our waitress , who i must admit was incredibly cute and a total sweetheart , was very inexperienced , noticeably so . our entree ' s , chicken tikka masala and madras chicken , were fairly good . better than the other indian restaurant just up the street to the west . we ran out of rice , and they offered no refill . the garlic naan was soft but lacking in flavor . our mango lassi ' s were bright orange , but strangely tasteless , as if either cheap mango pulp or food coloring was used . we also ordered a lamb biryani . but what we got wasn ' t really biryani at all . it appeared to be just lamb , rice and whatever basic masala gravy they had around in the kitchen . it had none of the whole spices and fragrant , intriguing flavors of a good biryani . and in the end , the owner did not give us the N discount he offered outside . not a great experience . 
amazing ! ! for a quick bite , i would definitely recommend mac attack . the staff is incredibly friendly . they made sure that everything in our order was perfect and we were satisfied . i recommend the reuben mac and the smoked chicken mac . if you ' re looking for grilled cheese , the manchego and apple was super tasty . i will definitely be back ! ! 
the lan zhou soups are decent- but not better than other chinatown spots specializing in the same thing . i was not fond of the beef noodle broth- had that chinese parsley flavor to it . the roast duck vermicelli had a different soup base that was tastier . the actual duck pieces were pretty minimal and were mostly fat bones- not much meat . the ambience sucks big time- i would only go here for take out and o nly if in the area . 
went here last night for the first time . this place is all style and no substance . i had the mac attack as my entree and overall , it was pretty mediocre . the one w the truffle oil wasn ' t bad , but the other two tasted like standard mac cheese you can get elsewhere . i also had the apricot arnold palmer drink and that just tasted like bad lemonade , not at all representative of the description on the menu . and as for service , our waiter was rather snooty and never bothered to check in on us to see how our meals were . so cafeteria is wayyyy overhyped and way overpriced for what you ' re paying for . this place definitely tries too hard to maintain a certain " attitude " and tries to be this hip , upscale-ish type of place when it just comes across as pretentious and inauthentic . it ' s hard to believe that people would actually line up to eat at this place . do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for better food and service and doesn ' t try to pretend to be something that it ' s not . 
i finally had the opportunity to have dinner at north end grill and much like my lunch experience - it did not disappoint . i took a group of N clients and had a great table in the back of the restaurant . the atmosphere was upbeat and energetic , but still wllowed for conversation . the dinner menu has many of my favorites from the lunch menu - with some wonderful additions . amazingly all N of us enjoyed all of our courses , so much so that we were quickly sharing bites and swapping plates . i ordered the louisana shrimp ( perfect grilled with yummy punchy seasoning ) as an appetizer and the halibut ( served in a delightful broth ) with clams and turnips as an entree . i am not a huge fan of turnips or clams , yet i found myself scooping up every bite . i also tasted the lobster , lamb ( which had no gamey-ness ) and salmon . two people ordered the bone marrow appetizer and both them commented on how unique and delicious it was . every single one of our plates was almost licked clean and the entire table kept sharing the favorite aspects of the meal . just when you thought we couldn ' t be any happier . . . we ordered desserts . again , there was lots of sharing and tasting . all the desserts were nicely sized ( not too endulgent ) and were presented beautifully . i tried the apple tart , chocolate pecan cake , salted caramel gelato , butterscotch pot de creme ( i strongly dislike butterscotch and couldn ' t stop taking bites . . . ) and the cheesecake . simply delicious . all of this was topped off by stellar service which was attentive without being intrusive . my clients also comments on how nice the open kitchen was which was absolutely buzzing with energy . 
pretentious , overprices , frankly ridiculous . there are dozens of better restaurants in this city . we were a party of four , ordered appetizer and main courses , all different . there was not a single dish which was exceptional in any way , other than the price and in a few cases and size . his restaurant is a case of the emperors new clothes and the chef must be sitting in the back laughing at how easily fooled his customs are . it was a disappointment . the service was patronizing and slightly obnoxious . we wont be returning . 
i was ready to experience ants pants cafe on friday afternoon only to find out that they closed their doors at Npm on weekdays ( Npm on weekends ) . talk about the wotrst coffeehouse cafe hours ever ! feeling like the coffee gods have smited me i stammered around south street in search of the nearest house . fortunatrely this spot wasn ' t too far away . la va had plenty of my usual coffeehouse requirements in check . good atmosphere with free wi fi and interesting art on the walls . check ! plenty of inexpensive pastry options and a good variety of caffinated options . check ! great music playing . uber check , especially since listening to tom waits version of " love stinks " made me feel giddy inside . all in all i ' d say that it ' s definitely a spot thats worth adding onto my list . 
krug ' s is great , it ' s a real dive bar cheap drinks loose , friendly people . highly recommended ! 
loveee drinking here ! small space , but fun with the right people ! the food is okay ( regular bar food ! ) i do recommend the spinach dip ! ( yumm ) 
this place is an emblem of my adolescence . now , many years later ( and much more mature ) , i am still transported back to those days but enjoy their delicious falafel , wrapped in a warm pita bread with lettuce , hummus , tahini and hot sauce just as much . 
a lot of my college friends raved about this place , saying that it was all you can eat at a pretty fair price . naturally , i took their suggestions and decided to check it out for myself . i was thoroughly disappointed . the service at sushi palace makes the service at mcdonalds look professional . me and one of my friends asked about the menu , since it was our first time eating here . our waiter couldn ' t help us , since she knew next to no english . she didn ' t bother to try and get someone else to help us-she just ignored us ! after figuring it out ourselves and ordering , our food took forever to arrive . when it did , it was presented in a lackadaisical manner . for a few strips of chicken katsu , ( yes , only a few ) it looked like they were thrown on the plate with the least amount of care possible . the sushi was fine , although nothing spectacular . this was a let down , considering how long we waited . if you like quantity over quality , this place might be for you . however , i can say that i won ' t be coming back . 
the halal cart is one of those things i have heard so much about but being in la i can ' t find anything like it . i pounced at the change to try it and it was my very first meal when i got to ny . the most popular thing from the cart is chicken over rice ( or if chicken isn ' t your thing there ' s lamb ) . turns out halal is not a food but rather dietary rules restrictions . thanks google ! the chicken is seasoned and cooked on a griddle and the rice is originally held in a white plastic bag like you would get at the market . scary i know . it put into a big foil boil with some salad and a piece of pita bread and covered with white sauce . what ' s in the white sauce ? apparently its just mayo vinegar and not some magic sauce invented by the gods . even if you ask for a little bit of it . . they will douse it . there is also hot sauce but if you love spicy . . it should be no problem . portions are large . maybe its because i ' m not a new york native . . but i felt sick after . i didn ' t care though . . the food was worth the pain . since there are so many carts trying to capitalize on the popularity . . it ' ll be hard to find which one is the correct cart . i simply looked for the line . there seems to always be a line . if that fails . . look for a mamma mia umbrella . 
i have been here twice . the first visit was at least six or seven years ago and i remember it being a good experience all around . a recent visit had both positives and negatives . the food was uniformly excellent . our group of four had starters that included a wedge salad with a fantastic blue cheese vinaigrette , a beet , asparagus and stilton cheese salad , clams casino and oysters rockefeller . all were pronounced delicious . entrees included a filet mignon , two ny strip steaks and a veal chop . all were perfectly cooked and the steaks were accompanied by fantastic roasted garlic that we could squeeze right onto the meat . sides were all excellent , as well truffled creamed spinach , some sort of cubed , brown potatoes with a parmesan crust and saut ed wild mushrooms . desserts were huge and delicious . they included a caramelized banana tart and a gigantic slab of cheesecake . so all in all , great food . so why only three stars instead of four or five ? one of our group is a wine enthusiast . we always defer to his expertise as he has never steered us wrong . he ordered the N dry creek zinfandel , which as usual turned out to be a great choice . we polished that off quickly and ordered another . he was never offered the chance to see the bottle , and as were engaged in conversation he didn ' t ask to see it . we were not offered new wine glasses and the waiter poured it . wait , this tasted different . called the manager over and asked if it was the same vintage . the manager got really defensive right away and said he would go check . sure enough , this was a N and it really was a different year in terms of quality ( apparently ) . he said he always checks for vintage changes , blah blah blah . no apology , no offer of something else , nada . my wine enthusiast friend was emphatic that it would have been nice to have been informed of the change , but said it was not the end of the world . the manager just continued to blather on like a defensive ten-year old who was just caught doing something he shouldn ' t have been doing . we were not impressed . at these prices and at this quality of cooking , what a disconnect in terms of service ! they need to train both their servers and their managers how to deal with both vintage changes and customer service . they brought a free fifth dessert we neither wanted nor requested . it was rather lame , all things considered . it isn ' t about the money , it is about maintaining a level of quality . we decided that we much prefer byos where we can control what we are drinking ! 
ordered N . pork buns appetizer- decent for the price . tasty pork . N . i don ' t remember the ramen names but we got their specialty with pork which was good . i liked their ramen better than shin sen gumi which seemed al dente . the thicker than usual broth with garlic flavor was tasty ! i ended up splitting a Nnd order of ramen with my friend for N . it is added to your existing bowl of broth . ambiance cool place for parties or even a date . semi-dark . . enough light to see everyone and menu , but dark enough for a lounge club feel . waited for N minutes for N people to sit at the bar . enjoyed watching the chefs cook . didn ' t eat the cucumber appetizer but it looked tasty . 
honestly the sandwich tasted great my only issue is the lack of meat ! my god for N there was barely any meat just filler . . . onions , mushrooms , and that big ole hot pepper in the fire steak . i ' m not the least bit happy . 
had the ' penny cluse ' biscuits and gravy and wasn ' t impressed . i think it is vegetarian , and i am used to the rich , southern sausage gravy . i do like their homefries though . the turmeric and onions make them unique . taco salad was solid . simple , tasty , and filling ( big salad ! ) . go early for breakfast otherwise there ' s a terribly long wait . 
this place is pretty ok for brunch with groups of less than N . the wait is usually short , especially compared with penelope ' s ( this was N minutes for us ) . however , the food is pretty average in my experience . i ' ve had the grilled chicken sandwich and croque monsieur before and both were pretty bland tasting . however , they do serve a pretty mean french fry . 
i eat here almost weekly and food is consistently excellent . one of the best malaysian restaurants around ! try the roti , dumplings , rendang . . . and one of our favorites , the salted fried rice . 
arrived at N N . they only have N tables for two and both were occupied . we were told it would be an hour and a half so we chose to sit at the bar . we started with a half bottle of pinot noir N that was very good . appetizer menu is small , my wife chose grilled clams and i opted for scallops from the entree menu as my appetizer . N scallops arrived , great seasoing however they were undercooked , two of my wifes clams were raw as well . for our entree ' s we both ordered the hanger steak medium and they were cooked to perfection . flavor was delicious . for our sides we chose to share the scallions , green beans and mashed potatos in truffle oil . all were very good . our bartender server was extremely friendly and the service was great . sitting at the bar wasn ' t a bad experience either , actually in this setting i think i would prefer it . they do o not rush you out even though they could use the space . for dessert our server treated us to the salted caramel creme du pot and it was great . overall i enjoyed the experience and the food . i would definitely return but i ' d probably skip ordering seafood at a place known for their steaks . 
mussels were not fresh . service is beyond poor yet they try to sneak in a mandatory N tip without even telling you . they still give you . they do not write in the tip . they try to be sneaky
what a hidden gem ! it ' s located right next to the famous grimaldi ' s but what most people don ' t know is that this place is owned by patsy grimaldi . thus , you can skip the long lines at grimaldi ' s and come here . i went on a sunday at N pm and there was no wait , unlike grimaldi ' s which had about N people lined up on the sidewalk . our server was extremely friendly and attentive . we ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious . although they should technically be the same , i enjoyed it a lot better than when i ate at grimaldi ' s , which is still good also . 
this is the real deal . awesome tacos . amazing robust flavor . tried the cactus ones and was not a fan but all the meat ones are phenomenal . . . 
pat ' s is the true philly cheesesteak place . i was glad to have lived right down the street from the iconic eatery . great stuff . 
this is a good spot for some lunch and italian food . nothing earth shattering , but good . we had reservations , but we were put at a tiny table and it was very hot outside , and for some reason the restaurant inside was also very hot . i agree with other reviewers about the noise , it was loud as well . food was good , not the most memorable meal , but good . i would return in the winter , i am sure it is a great spot on a cold day ! 
our server carlos was great . really engaged with us , made recommendations on both drinks and food . they have some good craft beers on tap i ordered a brooklyn blast while my girlfriend ordered an allagash white i built my own burger half pound on a brioche roll with american cheese , a sunny side up egg , and the usual fixins . medium rare . the burger was cooked to perfection and every bite melted in my mouth . my girlfriend turned her ahi tuna burger into a salad ( super cool idea ) and she loved it . and her side was this ridiculously awesome grilled veggie skewer . the only star taken off . . . overall value . when burger joints stop charging N a burger i ' ll give great food and great service the full N stars . but when my pocket burns at the end of the meal , me as i prob won ' t be back too soon because N for two people is a lot . 
i came here for a surprise going away party for a close friend . it was N of us and we had a section of this intimate restaurant to ourselves . the decor was lovely , and our waiter , william , was super charismatic . he brought me a whiskey drink which was amazing ! food was just ehh . no one left impressed . the menu is different at the perry st location ( which i love ) . all in all , we had a great time . would come back for drinks at the bar , and to try some of their apps instead . 
this place was the perfect choice for a romantic birthday dinner for my boyfriend . i knew his standards of latin cuisine would already be high since he is dominican and enjoys great food at home , so i was hoping this place would be up to his standards . when we got to the neighborhood on a monday , the whole block was parked with cars , it was impossible to find parking , i definitely did not see any valet parking unless im blind , so N mins later after finding a parking spot , we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who had us take a seat on the couch for N mins before finding us a table . in the summer they offer indoor and outdoor seating , but it was already chilly out so i chose indoor . the outdoor seating there looks gorgeous , you literally see the empire state building right in front of you , but sadly the tree blocks some of the view . what was really nice about this place was that the menu lights up , very cool touch to this place , and all the windows around you are glass so you can still see the city lights inside too , and the place with dimly lit with lots of pretty candles so it was very romantic . the furniture in the place is very sheek and classy , and the place is literally spotless , even the bathroom was super fancy . anyway , for a monday night it was super packed , so i already figured that if a place like this is packed on a monday night , that means this place is the real deal . the menu was pretty much latin peruvian with some american options too , with options like fresh guacamole , arepas , some seafood options like shrimp and fried fish , or you can do a combo like steak and shrimp surf and turf , they also offer sides like maduros , yellow rice , rice and beans , mashed potatoes too . for the appetizers we decided to go with wild mushroom flatbread , which my boyfriend gobbled up in less then two seconds , it tasted just like pizza with a perfect touch of garlic and oil , to die for , super cheesy too . ( N ) i was also drooling at the mac and cheese appetizer , it was a huge portion with tons of cheese ! -did i mention i like cheese ! - there was many delicious entrees that made it hard to choose , including pork shank , a stuffed burger with cheese and fries , chicken with rice and beans , and of course since its peruvian they have churasco , which is something my boyfriend and i chose right away , his done well mine done medium . the portions were huge , they give you two large pieces of skirt steak , with N tostones the size of your head , along with sides of rice and beans all for N dollars . the steak came with oil and oregano garlic which i poured a generous amount of , it was the perfect , really made a difference in the seasoning , and the meat itself was pretty juicy . the beans also had a lot of flavor and the rice was cooked perfectly , the tostones were crispy the way i like it . the service itself was a bit slow , i know this place was packed and hectic , and perhaps understaffed , so we only got two glasses of water that night , i asked for ketchup and never got any , and the waitress only stopped by twice , to take our order and to give our bill , but at least she was friendly . the drinks in the place are really good , i really recommend their margaritas , not too much sugar or alcohol , there was a perfect balance , it was a little tangy , i got the skinny version and it still tasted just as a good , but they did put a too much ice in the drink so it got watered down quick the table behind us had a large group of girls who were loud and rowdy , and i feel like the crowd this restaurant attracts certain clientele that tends to be ratchet , but that ' s noneee of my business the table next to us did find another persons hair in their burger , and the manager gladly took care of it right away with no charge making a new burger for my boyfriend they gave him a dessert on the house , between flan and chocolate or tres leches , we chose tres leches tasted ridiculously good and they sang him happy birthday , he was super embarrassed but we had fun , this place made my boyfriends birthday very special , and for N dollars entrees range from N-N , it was totally worth it . 
refused to accommodate a large group of paying customers hoping to watch some scN . horrible bar , horrible management , never ever go there . 
we had the foie gras and the kamapchi tartar to start they where magnificent . the halibut was great , which was my main dish , but do not order this if you do not like hazelnuts . the cheese plate was the ending all was well done , the flavors where great i would head back to this restaurant in a heart beat it was truly exceptional . the starters are around N to N bucks and the main dish will set you back N or so on up to N for the steak . 
great subs ! catered for my children ' s birthday party for N people . . . had a great variety and great tasting . the prices were reasonable and they were very accommodating to our specific needs . great experience will definitely use them again . 
a nice little quick place for all your sushi and karaoke needs . the food was above average but then again nothing truly life changing . 
solid joint . truffle fries are killer . staff can be snobby . small smace , and sometimes the tables are so close together , it really ruins your time . however , i ' m still going back , and will continue to do so , so i guess it doesn ' t bother me that much . 
superb . it ' s hard to get a table , but if you can get there first thing ( Nam ! ) on weekends , the breakfast brunch food is unbeatable . also a terrific spot to drop by on saturday afternoon for a glass of wine and cheese . one of the nyc ' s best places ever . 
i love their steaks ! try to get there at least once a month ! 
i feel like i am in seoul again at this place . something about the ambience , staff , and the food ! i was honestly really surprised to find such high quality in a city with little other competition in terms of korean food . it ' s better than anywhere i found in boston , where there is more competition . we also brought our young toddler and the staff was very kind , bringing her plain tofu cubes and other mild things she could chew . i love everything about this restaurant , always a treat to go . the pa-juhn is particularly masterfully done . the kim-chee is excellent too . 
the best bbq beef banh mi ! 
wonderfully inventive pizza . great salads and solid beer selection . plus a brooklyn vibe that doesn ' t quit . met pauly gee too and he is a gracious host . i would come back in a heartbeat . this place has all the ingredients for a memorable meal . 
i admit the first time i came here , i left a little underwhelmed . hamburgers without ketchup ? ! plain white bread ? ! ? also , the claim to invent the hamburger strikes me as a little dubious , but i ' m not a history doctor over here , so what do i care . however , a foodie friend of mine recommended this place late one night after a few cocktails ( when else ? ) , so i decided to try to keep an open mind and taste the burger for itself . and i have to say it was pretty fucking amazing . there ' s something very classic about the combination of tastes . the way the toasted bread , the beef , the onion , the cheese , and the lettuce . . . it strips the cheeseburger down to its essence . and i must say , what ' s left is savory . something simple and yet tasteful . is it my all-time favorite burger in new haven ? no , it isn ' t . but as far as late-night eats goes , you could do a whole heck of a lot worse than louis ' lunch . if you haven ' t tried it , i highly recommend giving them a chance . you won ' t regret it . or maybe you will . what am i , your mother ? 
once you ' ve had this pizza , there ' s nothing else that will do . fabulous thin crust . great cheese . the white pizza with olives and red onions is my favorite . not cheap pizza , especially , when you add the extras , but totally memorable , so much so that as i write this i ' m beginning to crave it . a great place . 
wow - a great place , with really good prices . sliders are N , or N . N with bacon , a huge portion of shoestring fries ( twice as much as a probably needed ) is N , and a good beer N ( i had a spaten lager ) . next time i ' ll try one of their milkshakes . the atmosphere is hip but friendly - i ate the the bar and had a good time . they also have tables in the back . the burgers themselves are very good for burger lovers - not overcooked thank god ( pink in the middle ) and you can really taste the meat and the grill . the onions probably could have been a little more cooked or a little less stringly , but that ' s a small point . they ' re served on potato rolls , my favorite . 
absolutely love this place . whiskey bourbon , beer and classic cocktail selections are excellent . this place is cheap , fantastic pub food . a limited menu , but everything i ' ve had on it is basically perfect . the village burger is , huge , juicy , and one of the best burgers in town , and the bbq pork sandwich is fantastic . i also highly recommend the deviled eggs . wish they took reservations , b c the place is small and the wait is usually extremely long . fortunately i live close by ) 
this is my second time here and it definitely did not disappoint . so far the two sandwiches i have had , echo-ella ' s flight and their signature flying meatball sandwich , have been very tasty and , contrary to other reviewers , left me feeling very full and satisfied . if you haven ' t been in yet , definitely worth the trip . you won ' t be sorry . on a side note , be ready to buy more than just lunch . somehow each time i have been in there , i always walk out with some extra goodies that i definitely did not need , but they are too good to pass up . 
venice the restaurant has a soap opera ambiance filled with drama , arrogance and disrespect . the management team is in a constant battle for power . they show no respect for customers or their current or past employees . their famous venice bar pie is now tissue paper thin and very greasy . their prices have gone up while the portions have gotten smaller . so i ask is this where you want to be or find a different establishment , , , , , your call fyi there are no buy backs ever at venice , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
given that it ' s home to the american burger , i think louis ' has built up a hype that it can ' t meet . but if you just take it for what it is , a small shop with good , cheap burgers , you ' ll enjoy it ! go early because waiting in line can be a pain and will probably make you grumpy . but once you do , grab a burger and sit at the end of one of the very crowded tables and just savor each bite . if you like burgers or are a generally hungry person , get two burgers because one probably won ' t fill you up . they ' re tender and juicy , and it ' s one of those places you just have to eat at to say you did , but will also enjoy . 
very simple , delicious chinese food at really reasonable prices . fast service and the food was much less greasy than typical chinese restaurants . all food was served steaming hot and fresh ( wonton soup , shrimp and broccoli , shrimp in lobster sauce , chicken chow mein ) . will definitely return . 
this place is always great ! N stars ! ! good pizza . 
gogocurry is a fast food chain in japan , this location is the companies first in the us . here ' s the entire menu in a nutshell huge scoop of white rice covered in a thick gravy-like curry sauce , topped with your choice of crispy fried pork ( aka katsu ) or chicken , sausage , or shrimp ( a combo plate is also available ) . each plate is served in N sizes ( N-N mostly ) . the procedure here is once you order pay you grab a seat and wait for your number to be called . surprisingly if you ' re eating there ( it ' s small so only a few tables are available ) you get a proper metal plate and silverware ( they also have a serve-yourself water cooler ) . i thought the food was pretty good and i was most surprised at how crispy and non greasy the meat was ( the batter wasn ' t thick at all ) and how they used actual pork ( like a really thin pork chop ) and not some cheap fake meat product like any other fast food chains in the us would use . if you ' re not a fan of the full plates you can also buy just the curry sauce and or the meat ala cart . it ' s not the healthiest food in the world but the quality and prices are good enough to bring me back sometime in the near future . 
i am so happy to have found this excellent korean food option on south and Nth . the bibimbap is excellent not overly spicy or greasy , and made to order very quickly . the vegetables are fresh , and the meat is high-quality . there are only a few items on the menu , but the bibimbap is so much better than rice mix ( which is just an awful bastardized american version of korean food ) . i always see korean people in here when i come to eat ( which is an important indicator of its traditional authenticity and quality ) . also , the korean owner is so cute and courteous -- he usually includes bits of " service " when you decide to eat-in ( e . g . extra rice , more sauce , kimchi ) . i always feel so good after i ' ve eaten lunch here full and satisfied without the food comatose . it ' s healthy , it ' s cheap , and the owner is so friendly ! go here ! 
we had dinner there this evening . we were kind of up in the air on where to go and i heard this place opened . wanting to drink some wine on a rainy night , a few of us opted to stay out of queens and hope for the best with this new place . i feel like i read or heard it being mentioned somewhere , most likely just an acknowledgement of its opening on brownstoner . my hopes were kind of high as it seems to be an easy formula . meaning , even when it ' s a mediocre place , enough garlic and wine can smooth things over . after a brief view , this seems to be their second location . the first being on Nth and Nnd . we ordered the garlic shrimp and the morcilla to start . six shrimp sat in a soup cup in light broth of garlic , butter and wine . next to the soup cup lay one limp and barely charred thinly sad piece of bread . the morcilla came mushed onto another sad thinly sliced soggy piece of bread . accompanying the blood sausage was an undressed salad of leafy greens . our waiter was pretty honest with us . when we first sat down . we asked if there were specials . he replied , the chef is not in town so , maybe next week there will be specials . one would hope , the chef normally prepared the appetizers and this was not the norm . we ordered the mix grill for two . on this sizzling cast iron grill pan , came beef short ribs , some hangar type steak ( miss k attacked that steak before i even made my way over to that side of the platter ) one sausage , one pounded piece of chicken breast . it was large platter of food , mostly consisting of short ribs . we asked for it to be cooked rare and it came out medium rare to medium . it came on a sizzling pan so , how could they be so accurate . the meats were very tender . however , they needed salt and flavor besides just a heavy beef fat taste . the chimichurri sauce was rather tasteless . there was no acid or salt so it was more like an oil . so , you were adding oil to the greasy meat . it ' s like , i come to an argentinian steakhouse because of the chimichurri sauce . so , don ' t f up the chimichurri . normally , there is this huge either gravy boat or some sort of plastic container filled with the sauce on the table . even before you get water , they bring out the sauce . but here , it ' s almost like they were embarrassed . they served it in what looked like , little japanese soy sauce containers . seriously , they provide you with less than a shot glass chimichurri . fries while normally something to look forward to at an argentinian steakhouse , these were average and saltless . the menu is pretty big . the kitchen is super tiny . consisting of like an N inch portable deep fryer , a salamander , a small oven , maybe an N burner range , i looked for a grill but did not see one . . the menu is way to big to be doing so many things well . it ' s a steakhouse , i think they can get rid of their N salad offerings , N menu items and just focus on the grill part . this isn ' t rocket science , everything seemed like an easy fix , perhaps tonight was not their night . place was crowded . i enjoyed how the seating was roomy . they could have thrown another N or N diners in the room . 
best gluten free bakery in new england . ) i recommend the black bean brownie and lemon bars ! ! simply amazing organic ingredients to make truly unique flavors ! 
love it here great food service and they also have the best margaritas ! 
wow these guys can really cook a mean taco . . . gotta have their tacos aztecas if you want to try something new . 
this spot is slammin ' ! cheap , delicious , fast food . the best falafel and shawarma i ' ve had in nyc . free falafel while you wait ? yes , please . 
the stars are for the mojitos best eva love the raw sugar cane that you can chew on that absorbs all the booze ) super authentic touch - overall strong and robust flavor - tons of mint . made with passion ! oh ! the food is great ! plentiful ! the tapas the brunch the lunch . one of my go to places . 
gumbo and any of the fried shrimp po boy are to die for . i can ' t get enough . the beignets are okay but the banana pudding is amazing creaming with little bits of bananas . don ' t forget to try the sugar honey iced tea , its dangerously delicious . the atmosphere well make you feel like you are sitting the french quarter
robataya is like the flashy guy who dazzles you with his fancy sports car and his big hair . ( insert reference to glee ' s recent episode on " hairography " . ) at first you ' re super impressed--but eventually you see through the smoke mirrors and realize that he ' s not really boyfriend material . 
fork is fine american dining . but at this price point , there are so many better options in philadelphia . i loved my meal here , the game hen was the most tender and delicious chicken i ' ve ever had . the service is on par with the food as well . my biggest annoyance is that the cocktail menu doesn ' t have names for the cocktails . instead of being able to order by name or number , i have to point to the menu , or say something foolish like " can i have the one with champagne and orange bitters ? " and hope there is no confusion . bottom line great food , not great using of dining . 
just okay banh mi and summer rolls . the summer rolls were filled with N rice noodles , a couple shrimp and some flavorless iceberg lettuce , not a herb to be seen . the sauce seemed watered down . the banh mi bread is nice and crusty , but the tofu , which was supposed to be spicy , didn ' t have much flavor at all , and what herbs were actually in the sandwich were unchopped so you would accidentally pull out some giant stalk you had to chew up with your mouthful . nothing special , lack of vietnamese flavor ( cyclo kills this place , but then again nyc isn ' t a great place for se asian food unless you find the few spots in queens ) . my biggest problem was the waste . they serve everything in plastic takeout containers which they do not recycle . imagine the waste from every couple that comes in to order a bowl of noodles or an appetizer ! get some plates , nam nam . 
the pretzels are divine . the food is completely out of this world and made here on site . i love the ambiance and the people who work here are so helpful . it ' s on the very chicest block of the lower east side right across from pilgrim ( best vintage chanel in nyc ) so i call this my pilgrimmage -- i go look at chanel and then come here to eat and then go back after thinking if i can afford a chanel bag or not and on and on it goes . i know it ' s a bit crazy but the food is good and after a few drinks , sometimes i walk back over across the street to pilgrim and score some fashion or a great chanel bag ( if i ' m really drinking ! ha ! ) 
grew up in the area and have always gone to frank ' s pizza . it ' s def one of the better pizza spots in newark , despite it being a little pricey . the neighborhood is a little sketchy , especially later in the evening but it ' s a small deterrent from some good pizza ! 
ask for the pizza well done in order to get that crispy , chewy crust . the crust has a nice flavor . pepperoni pizza was the best . . . the pepperoni was nicely charred and crispy . our server had an attitude . . . a bitch actually . . . the faces she made and her responses were downright rude . my husband , who is a very friendly person , wanted to tell her off but refrained for fear of her spitting on our pizza . 
very quaint little country store with souvenirs , fudge , ice cream , sandwiches and snacks . 
wow ! went for a birthday dinner and everything about it was wonderful . great reception and service , food was delicious and the wine perfect ! loved this place and will be back ! 
i ' m one of the few people who are simply not impressed . the dogs are good , but nothing to write home about . the service is actually pretty sh tty . i guess when a place is talked about so much , the wait staff doesn ' t care about being nice , since the money just keeps rolling in regardless . overall , it was just okay for me . 
pepe ' s is epic . a true new england legend . search " N best pizzas in america " -- N ? right here . deservedly so . 
guaco taco is excellent . awesome staff . 
stellar mac and cheese . . . . and at N am . . . the energy in the room was amazing , young , hip , and trendy . . . what more can you ask for ? the service isn ' t really that bad . . . patience is a virtue people ! 
brunch was terrible . bland oily food , no bottomless coffee . totally disappointing . won ' t go back . 
i love this place . the food is inventive and delicious . i would never order chicken in a restaurant , but here , it is incredible . double for the cauliflower and the fried olives . i don ' t love eggplant but even this girl enjoyed the bruschetta . wine list is unique in that all wines are at minimum organic . well thought out across the board . happy to return time and time again . 
visited the restaurant twice . the bar is nice and most of the staff is pleasant . however i feel the restaurant buys into its own hype . our last visit i ordered redfish entre and had about three pieces . the lady who served the cheese was unable to relax and was upset when i asked her question more than two times . you would think the staff especially in such an exclusive atmosphere would show some patience and modesty . . so when i go there again have the bread at the bar with the beer ( although it the bread is not free ) , the cheese is excellent no need to look at the rest of the menu . 
wonderful service . food was sub-par . this was my second time lunching at cooperage , a bar restaurant located in the curtis center . the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable . the food was alright , i ordered a cup of the tomato bisque and a half-sandwich of the french dip . the tomato bisque was standard - server said it was homemade . nothing out of the ordinary . the french dip came with gruyere and au jus . it definitely wasn ' t the best i ' ve had and also wasn ' t the worst . it lacked a lot of flavor . it was unappetizing and so i wrapped it up not to waste it . i ' m sure the dogs will like it . the beer list was decent for center city , i ordered the lagunitas brown . if i come back , it will be for the happy hour . 
tasty soups , great sushi rolls , what more can you ask for . 
worst italian food we ' ve ever had ! extremely overpriced food is not made to order . . . . everything came out within N minutes and tasted like canned ragu . horrible . 
fabulous place ! its cute , little , but you really feel like you ' re part of the family . the owner welcomed us right away and talked with us as though we were friends for years . the food , fortunately was not pretentious and was very satisfying . great portions , great atmosphere , really personal . i would def go back there . only thing - there aren ' t too many vegetarian items on the menu . 
come here if you like to get insulted and to learn some thai curse words . we came here on our memorial day vacation . we came here at around N Npm . i asked the guy at the front desk if they were still serving lunch . he said yes . me and my family came in and got seated . we ordered N lunch specials . after the food arrived we realized that the quantity of N dishes was barely enough for one person . the pad thai shrimp had one shrimp and the chicken was hidden under the pile of vegetables . we asked the server to get the menu and he responded that we have to order from the dinner menu since it was close to N . i said we are already here and are in the middle of the meal , besides its close to N N and not N . he said he will check with his boss . the boss came with the menu with an attitude , rolled her eyes and said she was doing us a favor by allowing us to order from the lunch menu in her thai accent . she may have cursed when she left . we ordered one more dish . while we were eating our last dish , the boss came right back with our check and said we should finish quickly since the dinner quests are coming . the place was empty . there was one couple besides us . i paid her promptly but did not give her a tip . she then came right back and rudely asked me why i did not pay any tip . i told her tip is for customer service , not to be treated like beggars . she said i did you a favor by allowing to order from lunch menu . i told her i don ' t want to argue with her . i just wanted to finish my food and leave as fast as we can . while we were leaving i could hear the boss and the waiter murmuring ( cursing ) . never ever will i come here or recommend anyone to come here . there is thai place on every corner of this street . if you have any self respect avoid this place even if they are serving free food and you have been starving . 
one of the worst sushi experiences ever . found a beetle on my friends lettuce right next to her rolls and brought it up to our waitress and the only thing she said was " i don ' t know how that got in here . we wash our lettuce every day " . didn ' t offer to comp our meal or anything . she took off the appetizer and that was it and acted like it wasn ' t a big deal at all finding a nasty bug in the food . . . i wouldn ' t come back here if you payed me to ! ! 
we visited this place again saturday dec N , it was packed , but the service was smooth , people were raving about how exceptional everything was . my girl friend ate almost all her grilled seafood platter and that plate is huge , i have to help her a little bit . on the other hand , i will recommend some christmas balls hanging from high ceiling . we enjoyed our visit and definitely will visit again . good job done by the new management ! 
great sights , sounds and smells . the amish breakfast is awesome ! the bakeries in the back as well as the roasted chicken wings are to die for . fresh cheeses , sausages , etc . you have to be prepared to eat something at this place . love it ! 
we ordered a bottle of red which was pinot noir , it was great ! ! one of their segnature dish " fried chicken . " fantastic ! it was very good fried chichen ! fresh oyster clam were also good ! steak was ok . only i did not like was onion ring . it was very oily not crispy . overall , it was great dinner , i will going back . 
this is their best location . spacious and everything on the menu is good . la playa is my favorite arepa . their sauces are fantastic . try the micheletta spicy beer . love it all their cocktails . nice corner table in the back if you have a special birthday dinner . 
great place . we moved to the neighborhood recently and decided to check it out and were not disappointed . 
- the fig and speck pizza is my favorite ! it was surprisingly good as it was the first time i had tried fig on a pizza but the combination with speck was amazing contrast of textures and flavors . - the salmon gravlax was very flavorful but very salty -- maybe less added salt on the pizza since there ' s capers added . - ambiance great patio area for summer time and nice comfortably dim indoor seating . really cool entrance way through the alley with the art piece by swiss urban artist felice varini that stretches onto the parking structure neighboring the restaurant . - service could improve speed and personability
ordered N sandwiches for N people . N the original , N the chicken , N the bbq pork was a N mins wait so i ordered N the beef bulgogi instead . gotta say , i ' ve had better of the N and N before ( in manhattan ) , but the bulgogi was pretty good . the chicken was a bit on the dry side . the bread was nice and soft and i loved that they do not cut the bread open all the way at the end so that the fillings do not squeeze out . i also ordered the spring rolls and summer rolls , but they stated that they don ' t make the summer rolls anymore . . . ? ? ? the spring rolls were tiny and they did not taste nor have ingredients of the normal vietnamese spring roll . . . disappointment . also ordered the vietnamese filtered coffee , this was the authentic coffee . i will have to try their so called famous fries and bbq pork sandwich next time . 
it is pretty unassuming from the outside . except for the big colorful sign , it looks like a dive bar ( which according to my father-in-law , it was , up until a few years ago . ) the menu is pretty diverse , from fresh seafood , to giant sandwiches . from all the food i saw coming saw out the kitchen , they handed all the variety quite well . we started with appetizers , fried calamari and a nice bowl of clear clam chowder . it was all clams ! , with a good mix of potatoes and other vegatables . the calamari was nice and crisp , with a good sauce . jen and i had the seafood ( i had the sauted scrod , jen had the lobster . the scrod was nice and flakey and the sauce was quite tasty . jen enjoyed the pulled lobster ( disclaimer , lobster is not my thing . i know every one loves , but its just not my deal ! ) my father-in-law had the corned beef rueben . the sandwich was on the verge of a dagwood special , grilled panini style . the meats are all roasted on premises , from the piece was given , it was quite tender . no complaints at all ! service wise , you need to take into account this small place is mad busy , with only N waiters you can run into some issues . ( we were there N Npm on monday night , and peeps were still waiting to sit down ) . we ran into usual busy restaurant pitfalls , they were out the special jen wanted , and mixed up my drink order , but they were quick to replace the drink , and gave jen time to make a new choice . all and all the staff was polite and courteous . 
we had some awesome plates- the salmon tartare on toast , the mushroom and fava bean app , and some not so great dishes . for example , the sugar snap peas salad was good but not great . and the raw scallops were quite boring , which was a big disappointment . we enjoyed our fried chicken over chard . for dessert we had the chocolate cake which is okay , the marshmallow topping was bland . we also had the salted caramel ice cream , and we couldn ' t taste the salt or caramel ! i had the rhubarb royal cocktail , which was pleasant but not fabulous . overall , the meal was over priced for just ok food and beverages . it also felt pretty pretentious , which i think is ok if the food was amazing . too bad it wasn ' t . 
good is mediocre at best , been there three times but won ' t go again . waste of time and money
totally awesome place ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i was here a couple of weeks ago and left a five star rating . i decided to try again and it gets better and better ! i happened to be hanging out reading the paper when the chef came over to my table to photograph the daily special , which happened to be fish and chips . after he took the photos , he very kindly offered me the plate for free ! ! ! ! not only was it delicious , and by far the most creative interpretation of fish and chips i ' ve ever had , but it was all sustainable and the potatoes were local . please check this place out ! ! ! ! ! it ' s becoming my new favorite in all of brooklyn . 
if you want good italian food do not eat here
awesome food , awesome service ! came in for dinner on a monday night and enjoyed everything that i had . the burnt ends and pulled pork were unbelievable . the mac and cheese was great , as we ' re the sweet potatoes and mashed . everything i ate was phenomenal , , , the atmosphere was relaxed and our waitress , sarah was great- she was sweet and helpful , making helpful recommendations . . . definitely a spot ill be frequently visiting . . this place is michelin recommended and definitely well worth it ! ! 
what a wonderful place to go to ! i came here for dinner with my best friend as a start to my birthday weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed the place . it was packed , so you should have a reservation around busier times . we shared the clams as an appetizer and ordered the halibut and the artic char . everything was delicious and came right as soon as we were finished with one course . we ended the night with the panna cotta and the sweet potato smore . i cannot express how fresh and wonderful the food was . the service is definitely what gave it N stars however . our server was polite and paid just the right amount of attention to us even in a packed restaurant . the check came with a little notebook for compliments , so cute ! will definitely be coming here more often . 
everything we ordered was doused in chili oil . they said it was the style of food from the origin it was targeting , but i am pretty sure it was just an excuse to put mediocre quality of food and preparation in a " foreign " sauce to americans . . aka chili oil . picture this . . . take out food with chili oil . the end . sorry . . . . 
i am definatley going to say that i never had a bad time eating here . the service was nothing but friendly and the setting was very nice and clean . i do think for what theyre doing there the food is great as well . also their desserts are really good as well . green tea creme brulee ? yum . 
went last night - love the decor . it ' s nice to have a cool place to get a drink and some good food in bloomfield . we live near the center so we can walk there - very west hartford-centerish - ) i had a flatbread that was great , bf had the inside out burger which he said was good but maybe not N good . that said we really enjoyed ourselves - he was pleased with the beer selection and i enjoyed a " cold toddy " ( good but potent ! ) and we had the banana bread pudding . we ' ll be back ! 
great food , great ambiance . the dining space is divided into several rooms so it has a small feel , yet they haven ' t crowded the tables in there so it has a relaxed feel . service is reasonably prompt , the menu is diverse , and everyone at my table enjoyed what they got for lunch . it wasn ' t too busy , for lunch on a friday anyway . 
come for the cozy and modern atmosphere , but definitely come for the food selection ! you can either choose to share tapas ( small and large plates ) or get your own portion . i came with two friends and we decided on the former . we ordered the chips salsa , green goddess salad , sliders , and the braised short ribs . all were excellent choices . the ribs were , by far , the highlight of the meal . the flavor and sauce pairings made it a rich focal point . 
you will be hard pressed to find anyone that says this place isn ' t really good or the best for sushi in the city . for my taste at least , it ' s the best sushi on the island ! had a short conversation with guy vaknin , the owner , who was a contestant on hell ' s kitchen . he is super nice and explained everything . this place is vegan and even if you can ' t think of sushi without fish or crab or whatnot , you just have to try it out ! he makes it feel like you aren ' t missing anything at all . this place is a must try , even if you are not vegan ! 
great food ! and i love the secluded locale . honesty , some of the best sushi i ' ve ever had . it just seemed very fresh and good sake too - not watered down at all . i will be back ! i didn ' t order a wide variety when i was there , i really just had a tast for sashimi . the next time , i will definitely sample more of their menu . looking around at other tables , everything there looked pretty delectable . 
my stay in new york would not be the same with out the halal guys ! this late night grub food seriously changed everything ! i thought we had good late night food here in la but they changed the game ! i was shocked at how good it was when i first tried it ! the white sauce was so good and all the flavors really do competent each other ! loved it
i love this place ! the owners are friendly , the space is big and sunny , the coffee is always good and they make swell fresh bread and cookies . nice spot for a half hour before work . 
stepped in here for lunch with a friend . we were one of only three or four people at first , but it soon packed out with the lunch crowd . everything was good and decently priced . the decor was different , i felt like i was in a converted garden shed . i ' m not sure someone with claustrophobia would enjoy sitting for very long , there are no windows on the walls . there are some nice slots in the ceiling though . the waitstaff were very attentive and the food came quickly . i wouldn ' t say anything completely wowed me from the menu , but the overall experience was a pleasant one . i would go back and try some other items off the menu . 
we recently held our wedding reception brooklyn stoops and couldn ' t be happier with the service , space and food provided . leading up to our wedding , my husband i communicated all of our requirements to the owner ocian , he was prompt with his responses and followed through with all our requests . although i didn ' t manage to eat a lot that night , our guests said that the food was excellent ( i can however say is that the drinks we ' re great ) . if you ' re looking for a space to have a party or event , i would absolutely recommend brooklyn stoops - great place , awesome night ! 
completely love this ! great great sushi ! ! ! ! i will be returning ! 
wasn ' t sure what to expect on christmas day , but our meals and service were outstanding . five of us were seated , with an extra chair added to a banquette table , which was large enough to fit us comfortably . the baguette was perfect , crisp crust but supple inside . other breads also were excellent . the mushroom tart was the taste highlight , pungent with carmelized onions and cheese ( gruyere ? ) , but also the only off note as the crust was somewhat burnt , fortunately not enough to detract from the flavors . a warm shrimp salad was fresh , with the shrimp properly cooked and not overdone . a half rotisserie chicken on pureed potato with a deeply colored gravy was simple but wonderful on a cold day . steak frites was perfectly done with a generous dollop of sauce bernaise on top . we took a small bag of macarons back to our hotel room , but they were a far cry from the ones you can get at any quality bakery in paris . 
feeling for brazilian ? you can find some delicious juicy meat here
pitchers . mmmm . good pizza . good locals . can get costly when going hungry . dreamy . 
i wandered into the otheroom to meet a few friends just after i moved to the west village in the summer . i generally find the bars in this neighborhood to be boring and or trying way too hard , but this place is genuinely a gem . i ' ve become a sunday regular and even become friends with a few others who pop in regularly . the atmosphere is chill , drinks are good , bartenders are good looking , hilarious and attentive . but this place gets the Nth star because it ' s one of the few places in the west village where you can still meet cool , interesting people and have a great conversation without paying N for a cocktail and fighting some douche-y banker and his douche-y girlfriend for elbow room . 
lamb cumin is the best ! plus they serve alcohol now ! 
well , let me start by saying a great looking place . yes . . . they have a brick oven , but they only heat up the slices for you . they do use the regular gas oven to bake your pizza . i think they should bake their pizza more it is to uncooked for my taste as it ' s still white and hardly cooked . i know it ' s new i am not saying i wont try it again , i will give it one more shot . . 
we have been there a number of times and we are never disappointed . must try the rock shrimp , chicken valdanstano ( sp ? ) , and the chocolate canoli . food is delicious , service is great , it ' s on the top of our list of favorite restaurants ! 
one of the best pizza places in the area . they don ' t skimp on the toppings or the size of their pizza . only drawback is they don ' t deliver but still worth the trip . they also make really good calzones , subs and garlic knots . highly recommend the white pie with spinach and tomato and their special pie is also really good . 
great place for lunch . the food is delicious and the service is great . wish i could afford it everyday though
agree with many of the reviewers before me ! my brother and i spent our childhood in singapore , lived there for N years , so i can tell good singaporean malaysian food from the bad . . . er , maybe not so authentic . and the one thing we miss most about singapore ? the food ! i came here with my family at my brother ' s recommendation , and because we were both craving some good malaysian singaporean food . when we arrived , we ordered the fish cakes , char kway teow , beef satay , singapore laksa , hainanese chicken rice , and roti canai , and finishing off our meal with a helping of bobo cha cha . this place is authentic as it gets , and we have eaten at many a malaysian restaurant here in queens . nobody serves up authentic singapore malay cuisine like they do here . it is the first place i have been to that genuinely brings up fond childhood memories . absolutely delicious , and even though i live in long island ' s north shore , i would not hesitate to return here again and again , with both friends and my family . oh , the best part ? the prices are far from overpriced , as i have seen in many malaysian restaurants , almost as cheap as the hawker centers in singapore . highly recommended ! 
went there last sunday with my gf . we both enjoyed the food - especially the carpaccio and also the mussels were delicious . try the creme br l e - it was fantastic ! 
a great neighborhood staple . . . have been multiple times and its not somewhere to go when your hungry , but for a few well engineered bites and a good bottle of value wine its always a hit . . . 
i have been here at least half a dozen times , however never for brunch , the menu changes quite often which is great because i tend to get stuck in routine at my favorite restaurants . anyway i especially enjoyed the N rabbit dishes , i ' ve never had rabbit before and i was pleasantly surprised ! when i can swing it i always get the wag-yu steak , they have some secrete way of cooking it that the chef tried to explain to me but i ' m no foodie so i cant tell you what it was . the " ants on a log " desert is probably my favorite of all time , its just so friggin clever ! the rest of the menu is really creative and fun and i have never been totally disappointed in anything i ordered , i would always recommend the salumi plate for starters ! i think the food is quite unique even for brooklyn , and the booze selection is quite good ( i don ' t drink wine ! ) . don ' t tell anyone ! but sometimes on the weekends they have a free diy s ' mores bar by the fire pit in the back yard , hardly anyone ever ventures back there , but its a super sweet treat to end any meal ! especially if anyone in your group smokes . . . lol . my only gripe about this place is that they don ' t have a burger on the menu , ever ! and i ' m pretty sure they take credit cards now . 
it took several visits for me to stopping projecting what i wanted sweet science to be and enjoy the spot for what it actually is . it was hard not to have expectations by the time this place opened in the spring - i watched , day by day , as an abandoned laundromat transformed very slowly into a combination restaurant and bar with reclaimed tables , leather couches , and rooms separated by large panes of glass . in the fall of N , i snuck into - with three pints of liquid courage - a private event held after the first presidential debate . the cocktails on offer that night were tasty ( and free ) and the portrait of biggie over the bar made me think that this would be a tribute to the nearby marcy projects . licensing and logistics kept the place from opening for another six months - long after eastwick stole the bragging rights of first cosmopolitan eatery to open on this stretch of graham avenue . early visits ( this place is essentially downstairs , so it ' s easy to pop in ) were confusing . the beer list was sub-par , the menu fussy with entrees in the N range . it didn ' t feel like a neighborhood bar , but the sometimes deafening late Ns hip-hop meant it wasn ' t a terribly nice place for a good meal . and the food didn ' t justify the price tag . thankfully management realized the problems as well , parting ways with a chef and rolling out a new menu with twists on bar food . with the addition of the smoker , this is now a real food destination . my pulled pork sandwich last night ( with a tangy south carolina barbecue sauce ) was shockingly tasty . the pork is tender but had none of the sogginess that can sink but the bun and meat in this dish . the mixed green salad had a nice vinaigrette to balance out the bitterness , while the sweet potato fries came with a zesty barbecue sauce . the wings are also highly recommended , while the innovative specials change out frequently . prices have come down to N-N for an entr e . the beer selection is improving as well - although they have some distance to go before meeting the standards of neighborhood favorites like duck duck and the tradesman . now that sweet scicence has found itself , maybe the neighborhood will now have a better idea what to do with it . the place continues to be busy or not on a schedule that flouts reason . mondays at N pm can be packed while thursdays are quiet . saturday nights tend to pick up only very , very late ( like N am ) . i think there ' s a " final stop " mentality at work here , but the food means that more should come earlier . 
cool restaurant but creepy mirrors ! i recently visited friends in philly and they took me out to continental midtown . the ambience is awesome and feels somewhat like a trendy , retro spaceship inside . i ' m gluten-intolerant and in general i was dismayed by the lack of options ( there ' s a lot of hidden added gluten in their dishes , so check with your waiter ! ) , but then the manager heard about my concern and came over and literally sat down with me at our booth and went through the menu options and variations with me until i found dishes that i was excited about and that were gluten-free . and he continued to check in with me throughout the meal to make sure i was happy with the choices we had settled on . it was like having a personal shopper , but at a restaurant ! our waitress was really nice too . i highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes with red wine sauce . they were to die for ! the two-way mirrors in the bathrooms are totally creepy , though . everyone standing outside the restrooms can see you through the mirror but you can ' t see them . and unless someone is standing at the mirror as you ' re entering the bathroom , it ' s not obvious that you ' re seeing into the bathroom because you can just see the tiled wall ( i thought it was some design as part of the retro decor outside the bathroom when i first entered ) , so then you go about you business in the bathroom then go to wash your hands , check your teeth , adjust your clothes , put on make-up , cover up your zits , or whatever in front the mirror , not realizing that people ( often just men ) are standing on the other side laughing and staring at you . one of the staff even walked by as i was standing outside the bathroom after realizing that the mirror was two-ways and he laughed while saying that his favorite times to watch were when women adjusted their bras and pushed up their breasts . totally creepy . 
best brunch in the city . shrimp and grits- come get some . brussels sprouts with sriracha . boom . egg sando- yum . great coffee . 
la sirene was my " i owe a good meal to myself " place . i was introduced to the place by my ex-boyfriend , and i claimed the place as my own . i would recommend the goat cheese tarts , and if you ' re really wanting to treat yourself- filet mignon . 
empanadas shrimp chicken meat skewers jamon croquettes churassco - an absolute must ! ! ! ! one of the best pieces of meats i have ever had ! ! ! ! arroz com pollo seafood marinera everything was excellent . food , atmosphere , music , service . i would definitely go back . it did tend to get a little loud , so it ' s not ideal for a romantic talk , but definitely a more lively environment . to top it off , we had homemade cigars given to us as we left ) . 
great wine selection , amazing happy hour prices ! good french food at an awesome price . the waiter was nice and the atmosphere was pleasant . this was a nice wine bar find ! ! 
my love affair with buvette began when they seated my friend before i arrived . imagine . fabulous wine , lovely decor , spot on service . and the food ! inexpensive small plates like the absolutely divine pesto . awesome charcuterie and cheese selections . and i love that they only serve breakfast on weekdays . my new favorite restaurant . 
great place with a fantastic menu . i stop by every so often and always enjoy the friendliness of the staff , the atmosphere , and the food . always enjoy whatever i end up randomly picking from their large menu . luckily i live so close that if i don ' t have time for a proper breakfast i can swing by and pick something up from their baked goods section and enjoy . 
been here twice now and the burger and wings are some of the best you can find in the city . amazing flavors . can ' t wait to go back ! 
the catfish sandwich is so good . . . i ' ve been here a couple of times now , and its the only thing i get . the bread is perfectly toasted , fish nicely coated and fried , the sauce goes well with it all . it is a small place , with limited seating upstairs , just so you know during peak times . . 
very good food ! ! ! 
i don ' t patronize restaurants that steal from their tipped and non-tipped employees ! consumerist . com N N 
best corn ever ! fish taco was awesome . was disappointed with their burger . guess it was my mistake to order a burger in a mexican place . place gets packed even on weekdays so be prepared to wait . no time to sit around and hang , they will kick you out coz there ' s too many people waiting . 
huge portions . great dishes ! try the specials . beef filet dish had a little too much rosemary . small restaurant so it can be a wait . 
cleverly " disguised " by old west indian dishes storefront sign which still stands outside the restaurant , do or dine is a place that you hope most people walk by so that there will always be a table open for yourself . once you enter , you ' ll probably give a speculative look at the friends who dragged you there ( it very well could be me ) because the interior design itself is a large mismash complete with skull and cross bones mosaic on the floor , disco ball spinning above , and , if you ' re lucky , wu-tang clan coming from the speakers . while you may think the decor is a bit bizarre , once you start reading the menu you ' ll realize that it is actually an accurate reflection of the restaurant itself a complete mish-mash of things that don ' t seem to work but when placed together compliment each other nicely . is there any other way to describe a foie gras doughnut ? ( side note this is made in conjunction with bed stuy neighbors dough which is a favorite of this author ) the best way to experience do or dine is with N or N friends so that you can all order and share as many of the dishes as possible because it is the unique pairing of flavors and ingredients that makes the part greater than the whole . not to say the whole is bad but you ' ll find yourself saying " i want to try everything " . onto the meal itself , i ' ve eaten here twice now and can vouch for most of the menu items but please keep in mind that there is a lot of variation based on ingredient availability and season . some of the regular items not to be missed include -the foie gras doughnut ( best split between no more than N people to ensure adequate portions of foie gras ) -georges steak tartare ( comes shaped like a cow ! how can you beat that ! ? ! i ' ll tell you how , by putting a freaking quail egg as a cow spot ) -shishito quatre sel ( great for snacking between dishes ) -the deviled eggs ( cleverly name eNs ) of the entrees , i can definitely vouch for the fish and some chips as this dish has both a great presentation and taste as you get to pick the meat right off the fully cooked snapper . the other time i went we tried their strip steak special ( a whopping Nlb cut ! ) which was served with various veggies . the steak was well prepared and juicy but what my friends and i were fighting over was the last remains of the kimchi kale and yuzu chimichurri sauce that was served with it . so why only N stars despite this absolutely glowing review ? the achilles heel of do or dine is the dessert selection which includes only a snickers ice cream bar . unfortunately , this isn ' t some cleverly named original concoction ( which the rest of the menu would have you believe ) but rather an honest to god snickers ice cream bar . don ' t get me wrong . . . . those things are delicious in their own right but after having such an amazing meal you just want to end it with something a little more imaginative and original than something you can pick up from the near by bodega . overall , you are only doing yourself a disservice by not dining there . of note , it is cash only so come prepared and it will fill up later in the night . 
is this place worth the wait ? no way . is it good ramen ? yes , it is . it totally is . if you ' re in the area during an off dining time , this is your spot . the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious . i would never in a million years wait N hours for ramen considering that there are other places that can also make good ramen where you may have to wait ( like N-N mins ) , and they will suffice . now that we ' ve gotten that bit out of the way , ippudo is a place that i would always recommend visitors to try to go . the inside is chic ( though a little dark for my taste ) and the yelling kind of transports you to a different place . it is a little noisy , especially if you want to chat with someone across the table . food to order ? the wasabi ramen is one of my favs . for apps , the pork buns are a must and so is the tako wasabi if you like raw octo . anyway , go here and try for yourself . beware of over ordering though because they won ' t let you take it to-go . 
it ' s better for groups because their portions are just too much , even for me who can eat a Noz porterhouse . good thing i went with a bunch of guys and girls from work . yum ! 
food was great as usual . server was strange . with N customers in the place , his answer to a question about substitutions on the menu , he says " the kitchen doesn ' t like to do substitutions and i don ' t want to confuse them . " lol . smh . 
this place brought in the joy of pbc and other locally brewed delights . the food here isn ' t your normal pub grub . its a little slice of heaven rolled into my favorite neighborhood bar . the crowd is great , the service is great , and the food selection is always changing with every day . the friendly neighborhood adds character to the place , and with live bands on the weekend , the bar can really fill up fast ! the owners do a great job of keeping local by buying their beers and food items from local brewery ' s and businesses . their pierogies are hand make on site , and imo are the best in the city . add on the list of quality beers and the green rock is dangerously close to being the best kept secret in philly . you should do yourself right and stop in to check it out . you ' ll leave in good spirits and a full stomach ! 
man i used to come here every week until i moved out of state ! love all their salads ! the one with chicken pecans and goat cheese always hit the spot for me . their focaccia was always just baked and delicious . can ' t complain about the food here i absolutely love it ! 
we are two respected ( tenured ) professors in the yale new haven community . when we dine out , we consider it a special treat . for that reason , when we are disappointed , we feel the need to inform the restaurant . in our opinion , this is how businesses improve their operations . the few times we have been disappointed over the years , we have always been met graciously , and smartly , with appreciation , by the owner s or management . more times than not , they have all bent over backwards to apologize , offering free drinks , dessert , a discount future meal , and so on . we do not expect this ingratiation , nor do we desire it , but , we think this is the right behavior . especially in small towns like new haven , ct where words get around fast . respecting customers engenders good relations , trust , and motivation to re-patronize . normally , a negative experience ends there . we either return to give them another chance , or we move on . recently however , we had such a bad experience that we feel the need to share this story with our fellow new haveners , or anyone else passing through , who might come upon this thread . a recent saturday N , we reserved a table in advance at nini ' s bistro in new haven , ct . unfortunately , we were disappointed with our experience , and wanted to express ourselves to the the owner of the establishment , felix proto . we had two complaints one , in small part , was about the table we were unexpectedly given in the gloomy overflow room around the corner . the second , and much more significant complaint , was about our full double entree , which was supposed to be a rack of lamb for two , and for which , we paid a surcharge and premium price . everything about our entree including the sides , was poorly prepared and mishandled . essentially , this kitchen ruined what should have been a good meal . because the restaurant was closing for the night , and we were tired , we decided not complain or stir emotions by sending food back . we made the best of it , finished our dinner and we tipped our waitress generously ( N ) . she was perfectly fine and absorbed our very mild grumblings in stride . we decided to call mr . proto on monday to let him know our impressions . what followed was beyond the pale in our collective experience . my partner started the call by politely ( i repeat , politely . ) , and gently , attempting to express our disappointment with the food we were served . a disappointment , as paying customers , who spent N . N , plus a N tip to his waitress , that we feel we are entitled to express . instead of learning something positive about the restaurant and its treatment of customers , what we learned is that felix proto has a predisposition to unprofessionalism and insulting behavior . regardless of a business owner ' s personal opinion , the absolute minimum professional response to respectfully lodged customer complaints is to listen , treat the person with return respect , and acknowledge their comments about your business . apparently , nini ' s bistro does not believe in this concept . this man was unwillingly to even listen to us . mr . proto gave neither of us an opportunity to say anything . instead of listening to a single word from his first time paying customers , he launched loudly and violently into a slew of totally false , and bizarre statements about our reservation , and interaction with his waitress . we both sat there listening by phone to this demonically possessed man yelling crazily for three to four minutes uninterrupted about things that never happened . finally , we heard his summation , which was that , ultimately , we are not entitled to complain because we had a " cheap meal " . then , he abruptly hung up the phone on us , allowing neither of us a single word . not a single word . my husband and i are even tempered people . we always treat others with respect , but we have never been so mistreated as patrons to a business as felix proto treated us on the phone that day . this man has an anger problem at the least , and no respect for the people who pay his bills . his behavior that day was not that of a professional or responsible business owner . it was the behavior of an arrogant , rude and crude , borderline thug . he would do well to recognize this as soon as possible before he alienates far more than one pair of customers . we can ' t ask you not to go to nini ' s bistro because we had an offensive experience with the owner . for us , that is reason enough . maybe you still want to go and take advantage of his " cheap " food . but , do not expect anything of notable quality in ingredients , nor especially in preparation . felix proto maintains an illusion that his byob prix fixe dinners at nini ' s bistro are well worth investing your time and money , but for us , a good bottle of wine is entirely wasted on poorly prepared food . in the end , the old adage holds true as ever . " you get what you pay for . " 
excellent food service . when you are waiting for a table- sometimes the wait time is not so accurate . i . e . - you are being told N minutes- when it is more like N N hour . great food worth the wait though . on a side note they need to get rid of the depressing picture of the two children looking terribly sad in the women ' s room . also a baby changing table in the ladies room would be nice . 
finally ! a filipino restaurant in nyc you can take your non-filipino friends to . we ' ve been waiting for such a place for years . authentic modern filipino food , not fusion , which is what i really like about it . i really liked how our server had a spiel explaining the condiments like the banana ketchup , maggi seasoning , etc . it really shows how the owners are trying to reach a market outside of the filipino community . i had their version of chicken and waffles . yum . portions were huge , though , and i finished just half the waffe and half a chicken thigh . the waffle was made with ube ( purple yams ) , the butter had bagoong ( shrimp paste ) , and the syrup had macapuno ( sweetened coconut ) . you wouldn ' t think to put these ingredients together , but the dish was awesome . for apps we had the barquillos ( clever presentation of the usual lumpiang shanghai ) , sisig , gambas , and the beer battered spam ( i wouldn ' t have imagined spam as an appetizer , but it works ) . for cocktails i had the teo tita . vodka and kalamansi and some other stuff . citrusy and refreshing , really good . we had an early N Npm reservation for dinner . unfortunately we got there a half hour late and we got kicked out of our table and transferred to the bar to finish the rest of our meal at N Npm because a party of N reserved the place . it ' s not their fault , we were late coming in , they did the right thing . i was just happy to learn that they ' re that busy ! decor was good . i also liked the staff ' s t-shirts , which they sell . my husband got the tapsilog ( cured beef with rice and egg ) , he said it was good but that it wasn ' t something he ' ll crave . they don ' t take credit cards though , which is a bummer . our bill came to N for N people , it ' s not everyday you ' d carry around that much cash to go to dinner . i think if they accepted cards , i would ' ve ordered more drinks since i wouldn ' t have to worry whether i had enough cash on me or not . they would get N stars from me if they took plastic . overall , i will definitely be back . they ' re opening a second location , where sa aming nayon used to be , called jeepney on N-N-N . can ' t wait to try that too . 
my best friend took me here for the first time and it was marvelous ! love all the dishes that we tried had a great time there ! 
ah . . . pho as close to home as i can get them . back then my mother would make pho every month , she would cook as if she was feeding a army ( literally ) , but sadly she would make it once every N-N months now . luckily , thanh da is a walk away ! whew ! the noodle is broader than what i ' m use to but it ' s okay . they are pretty generous on the meats . the soup base is bursting with flavor and msg ( it ' s not necessary a good thing but yes msg , that ' s how it is in asia , so get over it ) . . . thanh da ' s pho is pretty darn good but mom ' s is always better . side note i really don ' t think their sandwich is that good , the bread is always soft when i order it . inside is pretty hallow and very light in ingredients . it takes longer to make a banh mi than to get a bowl of pho ! want a satifying banh mi ? head over to ba xuyen . want pho that ' s good for the soul and flu ? stay here ! 
we went there after a night out . we waited outside because it was really busy . i didnt mind the wait because i work in the restaurant business and i know how it gets . what bothered me was the waiter attitude and manners . we ordered coffee he served us cold coffee ! ! ! ! ( we waited in the cold for almost an hour what makes you think we want cold coffee ) . he then gave us an attitude saying it will beN min more for hot coffee like we were suppose to specify what we wanted in our order . their lack of customer service mad the experience of enjoying the food taste bad . i usually give more than N tip but y should the busser and runners be punished for his stupidity
terrible food , service at the door was okay but service at the table was horrible . stay away . 
great place ! we had originally went there for the happy hour , but didn ' t plan accordingly and ended up being over an hour early . but seriously , N oyster shots is a great deal . food we shared a seafood sampler which had everything from lobsters to mussels to oysters . along with some beer and wine . i did find that i didn ' t take too much of a liking to oysters but everything else tasted great . atmosphere great atmosphere for a night out on the town . i suggest sharing a sampler between N or N people and ordering drinks and chatting it up for the night . 
i ordered a barbecue chicken pizza from alpha delta . it was alright . . . nothing really special , but not bad at all . the prices seemed a little lower than most other places in the area , so all things considered it was a good value . 
this is my favorite tea rooms in ny . coming into cha-an is almost like going into a spa . right when you enter , the ny rush-noise-craziness just stops . being in here is an absolute soothing experience . i ' ve been here various times and each time is not a let down . the place is quiet and easy for conversations . the place is small but i think the quaintness is appropriate for the vibe of this place . they have a wide range of teas , and the menu is easy to read . depending on the tea you are having , it comes in a customized tea pot and cup . they refill your pot with water once you run out . if your hungry or want an accompaniment , i would recommend the food . i ' ve had the cha-an set with cindy c one night . . . . it looks like a little but once you start eating it becomes one meal . i ' ve also had some sweets i would recommend all of them . if you or anyone else is not really feeling the tea , they do have alcohol . . . for drinks they have sake and cocktails . cha-an suites for multiple occasions whether if its pre or post dinner or with family or friends . cha-an is my ny escape . 
osteria morini is the latest avant garde italian theme restaurant churned out by the michael white blockbuster engine . downscale and homey , it fits nicely into that overcrowded ( but always welcome ) niche of mid-tier italian eateries . if marea is about the seafood and convivio is about the pasta , then osteria morini could be best described as a restaurant for wine snobs and meat wads ( my two favorite types of diners ) . the porchetta is a triumph of pork - perfectly tender on the inside , while the skin was rendered to crispy , crunchy levels of awesome . skewers of fluffy sweetbread and chunks of hampshire were also executed with precision , each lovely bite of piggy protein juicy and flavorful . the curiously curated wine list stumped my wine expert dining companion , as well as nyt wine critic , eric asimov - dinersjournal . blogs . nyti . but the wines are priced at a bargain , and the sommolier patiently explained the subtle yet difficult to understand nuances on how the terroir of a la marche vernaccia would contrast with a gutturnio grape from emilia romagna , etc . at the end of the day , the wines paired beautifully with the food and my wallet didn ' t get too much of an ass kicking . pastas were less exciting - far from the assertively tasty takes on complex carbs found at mr . white ' s other restaurants . creste , nicely al dente extruded pasta , paired with a light tomato sauce and sea critters , is fair but won ' t have me knocking at the door for seconds . stracci , flat kerchiefs of pasta is glossy with rosemary oil and a nice hit of mushrooms is similarly restrained and on the greasy side . refuge from the decadence of the pastas and meat can be found in the rucola , a peppery raw salad of arugula and parmesan . baby brussels sprouts are cooked to perfection , though cringing-ly salty from a too-heavy-hand of crispy pancetta . at this point , there ' s about a million and one restaurants in the same vein as morini - the lupa ' s , mailino ' s , aroma ' s , and what have you . but for meat freaks and wine geeks , osteria morini is a worthy destination . 
my friend recommended this place , we came all the way from cliffside park with my friends and subs are delicious , very good customer service , reasonable prices and the store is very cute great place to have lunch . 
if i haven ' t mentioned it all ready , annie is the best server here ! if you get her , you ' ll love her ! 
pretty standard fare . the place to go for quick , functional asian food ( i was in out in N minutes ! ) although i ' m not sure how authentic the malaysian cooking is , at least i heard a smattering of cantonese , which makes this place more authentic than , say , a pf changs . this is a broad-reaching chain , with locations as varied as boston , philadelphia--and apparently princeton . 
just a typical mexican chain restaurant . food ' s not terrible if you love cheese . but the service is inconsistent , and sometimes you can hear the employees yelling at each other - not a good sign . 
i have been to mole on several occasions and have yet to ever be disappointed . the homemade guacamole is great and ( as expected by the name ) the mole dishes are superb . also , their homemade flan ( i ' ve had the coconut ) is a delicious end to the meal . the only reason i couldn ' t give it N stars is because they don ' t serve alcohol and well , i ' m a gal who likes a margarita or beer with such fare . they do allow you to byow though . i guess the non-booze rule is part of the charm . . . absolutely highly reccommended ! 
wonderfully prepared and tasty dishes . homemade pasta specials . hannah our server was a delight and giorgio was pleasant and visited the table to make sure everything was good . will certainly visit giogio ' s again . . . and soon ! 
i love the macaroni and cheese . my blackberry lemonade was on point . the other food is good but not great . it gets pretty cramped and its loud . . . i guess that ' s why they are called cafeteria . anyway its a great atmosphere and i will go back again . 
i know it ' s redundant for me to post about the superiority of bonnie ' s burgers over that of say , corner bistro . my boyfriend ( a psloper ) is the one who introduced me ( les-er ) to bonnie ' s . my boyfriend is so cool . na na na . 
i definitely used to love going to this establishment . my friends and i made it a weekly trip to dosa night and loved every second of it . however , when they " relocated " the amazing host they had things changed . a new one was hired who seems to me extremely racist towards people . very rude . the food quality went down and what used to seem like a rapid fire of dosas from the kitchen turned into a N minute wait inbetween each one . i assume that was to make people order less to save them money ? i also had an incident where i ordered a cheese masala dosa and was brought something else . instead of the order being corrected the rude host insisted that " this was like cheese " and i should " just eat it . " no ! that isn ' t what i ordered . found a new place in east windsor . 
N strikes and you ' re out N ) no vegetarian meals N ) watery curry N ) at the end of the meal my friend and i saw a mouse running around the floor . when we pointed it out to management , they apologized but tried to shrug it off and blame it on the cold . can you say health violation ? needless to say i will not be returning . 
really ? i waited an hour for this ? ? the burger was small and mediocre , the fries had enough salt kill you and the shake was tiny . there are so many better places to eat in philadelphia . proof that crowd sourcing doesn ' t work . 
loved percy street . . i am excited that a new bbq place opened back on south street . i felt that bbq could work on south street it just had to be done right . good beer , excellent service , nice atmosphere and tasty food make it a winner . i love the pork belly , brisket and sausage . mac and cheese was creamy and delicious and so was the green bean casserole . i will have to go backa nd try the rest they have to offer . i can see why some people might complain about the style of bbq because they are probably used to having meat that is smothered in sauce . that is what makes this so good , you can taste the smokiness of the meat , and if you want some sauce they have a house you can put on it . i am excited we have some texas bbq in philly . it is usually a difficult thing to find . i am also really excited to check this place out when it gets warm out . our waiter was telling us they had a bluegrass band play there a few weeks ago . it will nice play to have a beer , enjoy the music and day when their big glass windows are open . thanks south street sure needed something else to open not close on that street . 
had dinner there last night with my wife and daughter . after being treated so rudely at zorbas we gave the blue cat a try . the evening was a total treat as we were treated so kindly by our waitress brenda who was very professional personable and well informed . the whole fish special was perfectly prepared and spiced as was the chicken special . although we were stuffed the rice pudding and ginger ice cream topped off a great experience . 
this place brings me back to israel - could close my eyes and easily be in tel aviv while eating it . fast service , delicious food , large portions . i will absolutely be back . 
greta burger place , one of my favorites . love the fact that they have such a selection of toppings for the burger . i always get the pork roll , onion rings , and blue cheese , those outside of nj may not know what pork roll is and you probably don ' t want to know before you try it . you can also get any number of milk shakes and they too are very good . the atmosphere is nice and the staff is excellent . i will continue to frequent this burger place and recommend it . 
this place is a must if you ' re in the neighborhood . there ' s something for everyone , including vegan options . interesting and non-traditional combinations . consistently great ! paulie always swings by to check how you ' re enjoying your pizzas . check this place out ! 
nothing wrong with the place - fine service , good food , and a inclusive atmosphere . 
the food was really good and the price is very reasonable , it ' s like having N stars food with fast food price , will definitely come back ! 
why is nobody talking about the greek yogurt ? ? i stopped in on a weekday evening after a hair appointment nearby - i ' d heard great things about anthi ' s and wanted to try out a few things since i ' m rarely in the uws neck of the woods . like others have said , it ' s definitely not an eat-in kind of place . i picked up a small container of gigantes beans , two servings of pastitsio , and a medium-size container of fig-infused greek yogurt and enjoyed a pleasant conversation ( in greek ) with the man who helped me . the whole thing ( after their N yelp check-in deal ) came out to N - not bad at all for two solid meals . the pastitsio wasn ' t the best version i ' ve ever tasted , and the gigantes were really good - i ' d get those again . but what really wowed me was the figgy yogurt - holy bananas , that ish was delicious ! ! i ' ve never seen greek yogurt with fruit actually mixed in before ( no , chobani etc . doesn ' t count ) and after tasting this delicious concoction i ' m surprised everyone ' s not doing it . anthi ' s had multiple flavors too ( apricot and mixed berry were the other two , i think ) and i can ' t wait to try them all out . they were sold out of stuffed peppers when i stopped by , but i ' ll be hitting those up for sure next time i go . 
i ' ve ordered here a few times from work . my chinese co-workers love this place ! although i scarcely trust their taste in asian food for a variety of reasons . ( how can someone grow up in china where they have good authentic chinese food and then come here and shovel american chinese cat crap down your throat three times a day ? ! ) . at any rate , this place offers malaysian food . honestly , i want to like this place more but every time i order from here , my stomach gets upset . i once came here with a friend and she reported the same thing . their dishes are tasty though . and cheap but you get what you pay for . but given a choice , i ' ll take vietnamese or thai food any day . 
went for dinner last night . had a great meal . the food was really good and the atmosphere was very comfortable . the bolognese dish was my favorite . the pizza and steak were really good too . nice wait staff . i recommend this as a casual but tasty place to go for dinner ! 
the outdoor patio is prime real estate for happy hour , take it from me the st gin cocktail all their martinis are to die for ! 
we found this wonderful restaurant quite by accident . our rental car broke down right in front of the restaurant so we stopped in for something to eat . the food was great , the drinks were free flowing and everyone was very friendly and helpful for two old , out-of-town tourists . philly truly is the city of brotherly love . we loved the patio and the murals . if my rental car ever breaks down again i hope it ' s in front of this lovely restaurant . 
the english muffin burger turkey burger was great . too bad the waitress was a complete b ! service sucks , i would have came back for the burger , but she ruined it . seems like the white trash dash in there anyway . way to go in keeping new customers . 
food was amazing ! ! ! started with monkey bread , " egg " -chicken wing ( unbelievably appetizing ) and for entree i had the rigatoni with duck sausage . loved the place reminded me of a restaurant i visited out on st marten . great service as well ! 
though tung hing ' s food is ok , their service sucks ! they have the worst woman in the world taking their phone orders ! she ' s so nasty , especially when they make a mistake . they got my order wrong and when i asked for them to fix it , she asked " can ' t you just eat that ? " no ! i want to eat what i ordered ! i ' d give them N and N N stars if they got rid of that nasty woman . never ordering from them again after that . 
the food level at this place goes down each time we have come in the past few years . salad bar was the worst lettuce soggy , hearts of palm unable to cut much less eat , cracked wheat salad had a gritty taste in the parsley ( sand ) . trying to get a taste of the different meats was near impossible . the chicken wrapped in bacon smelled like dog and was dry . coffee came out cold . seems like another is gonna bite the dust . 
if you are looking for a perfect brunch spot - you should look no longer . on a sunny sunday , the wait is typically N-N minutes , which is not a problem when there is so much to do around . the ambiance is wonderful - tables outside , inside , and in a cute little green garden room in the back . the decor is really cute and really makes you feel at home . the food was amazing - one of the best egg benedict dishes i have had . the orange juice is great ( mind you - i don ' t really like orange juice ) and the bloody mary was made well . definitely going back and suggest you all go and enjoy ! ! 
food is okay , its always many people . some food is reaaly good . 
chinese cuisine another good place for quick eats . over the years it has become a touristy location , but if you want to come for good wonton noodles , this is a great spot for it . the overall menu is alright , mostly their tastier dishes are the soup noodles . cheap and quick eats . 
my family is fairly conservative when it comes to indian food , so we ordered the basics . chicken tikka masala , garlic naan , shrimp curry , chana masala , boti saagwala and finished with an order of the kheer . we were all very impressed with the depth of the flavors without being overly spicy . ( we also ordered everything mild ! ) . chicken was juicy , not little sawdust chunks like other places ! shrimp was perfectly cooked ( although they left the tails on . . not sure why you would do that in a saucy dish ? maybe its a cultural thing ) the chana masala had a great ginger tang to it and the herbs were clearly fresh , not dried . garlic naan was great ( but that ' s nearly impossible to screw up ) . the boti was a combination of beef stewey tender pieces and some tough ones , but compared to the neighboring indian restaurants it was an N versus the other places N or N . overall we were all really impressed . this placed just moved into our favorite ranking for indian in montclair . only reason they didn ' t get a N star rating was the delivery . they took just over an hour to get down the block to glen ridge . 
one of my new favourite eateries ! miles is the perfect place to go anytime of the day . breakfast ? lunch ? dinner ? snack ? consistently delicious and fresh every time with a fantastic , health conscious menu . the interior is cute , servings are huge , and the prices are great-- definitely a good place to have a casual meal with friends . bonus points for being a byo and next door to magpie . 
i went here with a friend friday night . the sign said " please wait to be seated " so we waited in the entrance way . the hostess and the waiters were talking and fooling around by the soda machine . we still were waiting to be seated . another couple came in and a man in plain clothes got up from his table in the back and seated the couple personally . the hostess sat us shortly after . i don ' t know if the waiters do the whole restaurant or just a section , but N different waiters came to our table N different times for our orders . odd . my sprite tasted like old soda and left a weird aftertaste . i told waiter N , but nothing happened- no replacement , no apology- just a nod . we looked over the menu and it seemed to be rather pricey . this was our first time so we were unsure of what to order . when waiter N came by to take our order , he quickly left to answer questions for the regular couple in the corner . ok , so waiter N came by and got our order- N gyros , easy right ? we ordered at N Npm , and got our food at N Npm . that ' s way too long for something so simple . during our wait time , we say there listening to the waitstaff talk about how wasted they got over thanksgiving and such . we also saw them joke around with some guy named jason , and they let N waiter do all tables by himself as the N of them hung out . another regular came in and they quickly sat the family . we even got to watch and listen as a young attractive woman came to pick up her order and the waiters and the man in his plain clothes hit on her . she was visibly uncomfortable and in a hurry . she kept trying to leave , but they ' d make comments like " can you handle the tray ? you are so little , you need a man to help you or you may fall down the stairs . " the man in plain clothes " playfully " said " if you want i ' ll go home with you and help . " she declined stating her dad was more than capable of helping her out . this exchange made us uneasy . even another table near by was commenting like " give it up , dude , she ' s too young for you . " our food came and it was less than tasty . my gyro was filled with meat like beef jerky- tough to swallow and dry . i had overly charred pieces ! it would have been great if i had a drink to help the shoe leather down ! my guest had a pork filled pita and that too was dry . it was so disappointing since a friend gave it such a rave review . it ' s a " never again " for me . if i wanted to eat beef jerky in a pita , i ' d make it and it ' d be less than N . N for sure . and for bad service , i can just stay home . 
too much ! unfortunate , it is pretty room with a pretty view really great sounding menu but executed in a heavy handed , sophomoric way . overuse of good , high quality ingredients . more is not always better . too rich , too much salt , too much cream , too much butter , too much bacon , too heavy , just too much over all . we wont be back . 
i was pretty stunned by the prices maybe i haven ' t been eating out at asian places enough for dinner , but i thought it was a great deal . i got the seafood chow fun for N . N and i was amazed by the super large portion that i got . i ate til i was full and i brought the rest home for my mom to eat . she got pretty full off of it , too . so it was more like N . N for my meal o it was pretty yummy , too ! i really liked it . i like noodles and scallops and shrimp , so no problems there . i also got the roti canai , which was decent . the chicken wasn ' t very tender , but it was alright . i didn ' t finish my review funnily enough , i came here again several days later because the banh mi place across the street was closed . the service is brisk and helpful , if not very patient . my friends were pretty torn about what to get because they ' ve never had malaysian food before , so the waitress rattled off some recommendations and tried to help them . she did a pretty good job they all liked their food . i got the hainanese chicken this time around , and it was really good . the chicken has a very intense flavor . love it ! 
just went to ducks for the first time . this place is awesome . i am a professional athlete and have traveled all over the world to some of the best restaurants . i am happy that now i don ' t have to travel so far . the food is excellent . the atmosphere is great . order the ribs . you ' ll be glad you did . my top three places to eat in manhattan are mesa grill , otto ' s and now ducks . ducks is defiantly different . try one of the shakes also . if you don ' t like the food in this place , i don ' t know what to tell you . people have been telling me how good it is and i finally got there today . well worth it . i give it N stars . my name is tahl by the way . i am a pro athlete . you can look me up on google if you don ' t believe it . i don ' t think i have ever written a review for a restaurant but , had to do it for this place . really enjoyed my night there . awesome place ! 
absolutely some of the best farm to table food preperations you ' ll find . it was as if everything was better than the last . . . . . the service was attentive , the selections from the bar were sublime as well . a must do after a trip to the headhouse market in society hill
we , N of us total , came here because it was busy outside last night for dinner time and we decided to do a walk in for lunch today and it was still about N min wait . there ' s a second floor and it is gorgeous especial with the christmas decorations everywhere . the waiter was extremely nice and explain everything well , from appetizer to entree and let us know that the sizes of the food are family shared . we got fried calamari as an appetizer and it ' s the biggest appetizer we ' ve ever seen . we also got lasagna , shrimp paramagiana , and chicken scalloped scapiana , and the portion sizes were huge , and really delicious . we had to take two entrees to go . great food , great company , and awesome service ! 
seated right away in a perfect table in the back corner . quickly offered drinks and apps that arrived immediately . the thousand layer bread was delicious liked the potato one the best -N orders for N of us plus some fire cracker fritters . all good . loved the jungle chicken , kung pau shrimp- not anything like chinese . attentive service throughout , without rushing us . overall an excellent meal
just ok . . . well , not even really that ok . flat hoegaarden . . . they forgot my entree . . . then i was being agreeable , i said " ok forget the salmon , just get me some dumplings " and then they charged me for the dumplings - wtf ? i was dining with like , eight friends and everyone else had food and i was merely trying to appease the comfort of the wait staff for forgetting to put in an entire order . then the waitress was rude about it all - she forced me to get another beer instead of just taking the N dumplings off . oh and . the dumplings are great , but they are nothing more than the delicious dumplings you get in chinatown N N - except they charge N . . . for N . . . . so this place is lame . terrible cocktails - no discernible bite . no alcohol ? cool art on the ceiling outlining what happens to your liver when you ' re an alcoholic . i like to imagine the dude i most recently dated ( the one who gave me an std ) dying a horrible slow death due to liver disease . and voila ! i ' m happy . plus one star for the tibetan prayer flags hanging in the tree outside . 
to die for food . we ordered the salmon , steak frites and pork chop special wow they were stellar . the drinks were unique . i had the jalape o margarita which was different , in a good way - not too sweet just the right amount of heat from the jalape o . it was a busy night but we weren ' t rushed at all . one waitress ( who was fantastic ) and one bartender , so it was a teeny bit slow but that was no problem ! this is a great place to come , hang out , unwind with friends and enjoy some delicious food . 
as i ' m writing this review , my mouth is starting to water all over again from the amazing food from marc forge . the service and hospitality from the staff was also fantastic . marc forge is located in the tribeca area of manhattan that is walking distance from the wtc path station . as you walk up to forge , you have a small outdoor patio which offers street views , while the dining area gives that romantic feel due to the dim lighting and illuminating candles on the tables and along the walls . as we walked in , we were seated immediately for our friend ' s birthday gathering . a choice of red white wine was offered until the rest of our party arrived . just to say , every dish that was presented to us was exquisite . for starter we had stokes farms heirloom tomato salad , artichoke , black olive , and garlic salt kampachi tartare , saratoga chips , pinenuts , sechuana buttons bbq backed olde salt oyster , aromatic sea salt , pancetta powder octopus , white beans , caper berry salsa verde , irwin farms baby arugula entr e chili lobster , texas toast belly evan chicken under a brick , yukon potatoes , broccoli rabe , pan drippings creek stone farms N day dry aged rib eye " tomahawle " steak , pommes fondant , carrot glazed carrot i would say that finishing off the night with a slice of birthday cake was all . that was not the case for us we received a nice surprise visit from marc forge . he personally came to our table and had drinks with the birthday gal and us . she was so excited that he came over . we left the table and went over to the bar with marc . had a few more drinks with him and his staff before we realized everyone in the place was gone except for us . that right , we shut the place down ! ! ! ! ! with marc and his staff . mr . marc forge gets a great big shout out ! ! ! ! ! for a N star establishment
the food was tasty , but not amazing . i had the duck , which was quite good , but wasn ' t so fond of the risotto . also had a salad , and the dressing was kind of bland . the crumb cake with clotted cream was pretty yummy , as was the creme brulee . for the prices , kind of disappointing , even though the food was okay . service was friendly , but kind of slow , especially given that the restaurant was pretty empty . i do appreciate a byo , though , so i might give it another shot . 
the name is pretty good . i only went to the bar downstairs and didn ' t eat , so this is only based on that . the area is pretty small and not a great place to have a conversation , but it ' s ok overall . nothing special . kind of an older crowd ( like - over N . . . N . . . N even ) . the two downstairs girl bartenders are pretty rude - definitely N . N star worth of rude . 
wow ! ! ! such a small venue with enormous flavors . cosy ambience and perfect lighting . . . . i get hungry every time i think about this place , the most flavorful burgers and fries ever ! ! highly recommend it but don ' t be mad if it was crowded and you had to wait because it is very popular . 
great great food ! best wings in town . most recently we went to al gold ' s jam brunch and that was a fun sunday afternoon listening to music and drinking bloody mary ' s . . . relaxed atmosphere and staff is always friendly . the mayor comes by for dinner showing great support for a great spot . 
fries are delicious ! ! wish they had more options for toppings though and gave a bigger serving for N dollars . 
superb
i went to the trading post last night for dinner and drinks . i grew up around the corner from this place and had my sweet N party there when it was the yankee clipper . the re-vamp is unbelievable and the food was delicious , only to be topped by the fabulous service and friendly staff . i highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back soon . 
peaches ! oh how i miss your delicious french toast eggs and turkey bacon with grits on the side with a tall cold glass of oj ! ! peaches has some of the best southern food in brooklyn . their wait staff is super friendly and posh they are well mannered and detail oriented . this is a perfect place for large groups and family dates that ' s the feel i get when i enter this environment . i only been here twice but each time the food the service and the check was great lol . . . . 
went again and ordered the same catfish po ' boy . excited from my previous visit i was met with an awkwardly seasoned piece of fish . though it was still juicy , it lacked flavor and was extremely difficult to eat . the salad was drenched in dressing to the point of grossness we also got an order of the lemon pepper poached shrimp which were rough . maybe they sat on the ice for too long but they weren ' t enjoyable . i ate them just to have something to dip into the cajun mayo . the waitress was fine . it seems the kitchen is a bit inconstant which lessened my want to return . 
ate here tonight and thought everything was fantastic . the menu was creative , extensive , and i thought the portions were more than satisfying . the atmosphere was inviting and the space was well planned . i will continue to eat here often and plan to tell others to do the same ! i think it ' s a much needed addition to the westville village . 
beautiful space , beautiful produce and pastas , but too many people that i felt claustrophobic and had to leave . i did want to stay to eat but did not want to fight the crowds for a cafeteria like table with my very expensive lunch . would come every weekend if i didn ' t have to fight the crowds and tourists . 
came here for a private bday dinner and was happy with the food . i found that it was tasty and you got nice sized portions . had the ravioli in basil cream which was a little undercooked but very tasty . main portion was the pork tenderloin which was very tender but could have used more seasoning . . the sweet potato with apple and bacon side in cream was really good once you added some salt and pepper . the chocolate lava cake was tasty enough but probably wouldn ' t order again . i had a taste of my friend ' s scallops with butternut risotto in pecan butter and felt like i ' d died and gone to heaven . my go-to when i return . the atmosphere is a plus as it ' s quite charming and cozy . 
yes to the brussels sprouts and the kale salad , and to the miso ramen ( and to the delicious seasonal corn in the ramen ) , and to huge portions which means you can have sinus clearing ramen for lunch the next day . this is good enough that you ' ll forget that you waited outside for N minutes . 
Nst time here . just sitting in the garden transports me to a roadside restaurant along i-N or some highway , but i ' m sitting alongside a sidewalk in the middle of brooklyn . i ordered a scoop of spumoni ( hazlenut , pistachio vanilla stripped ice-cream ) . the combo of flavors work great together - thank you creator of spumoni . it has taste consistency of ice and ice-cream - i love it ! i want more . 
you can tell when walking by this place that they are on the right track . after you grab a sandwich you realize , yup , they know what they are doing . roast pork broccoli rabe and provolone hero ' s are quality , just brilliant . no fuss , just execution . i just called for some delivery . i like almost N blocks away and like my man at the counter when i made a visit , they said they would deliver too me . i ' m excited to get back in though , very decent selection of dried meats and cheeses . but the glass case to the right filled with the olives and everything you can keep in oil , has had me dreaming every since i saw . can ' t wait for my food to come . highly recommend trying this place , i ' ve only had about N items but trust me , i know the rest will be good . they even have every kind of san pellegrini w citrus , the lemon is the best drink on the planet that comes in a can , bold yes ! but true . 
love this place so much ! ! ! the employees are so sweet and helpful . the front of house is clean and organized and the good is fresh and tasty . i stop by as often as i can ! 
decent overall dexperience
i had the fish , chips oysters . the fish was kinda bland and the oysters ( like a previous comment ) tasted fishy like they were fried with the fish , disgusting . beer was very good and so was the service but only three stars overall . 
i take it back . the service is brutal , place is empty on a fri night andhad to go to the bar to get our drinks . i suppose probably exactly what you would expect from a mall restaurant . 
i love it , wife doesn ' t , its a wash
the customer service is absolutely unacceptable . not only do they discriminate , they over charge . i think people lost the sense of what a community is . you try to support businesses to help your community thrive and help them sustain and they do not appreciate it . i welcome the change of new businesses in this area because the new comers will be eager to please and work with customers . it ' s worth the drive to another location . 
today me and a friend decided to try out the bobby flay place in university city . first let me say that i ' ve never been moved by anything bobby has ever made on the food network so i should have known i wouldn ' t like the food . surprise ! i hated it . when i was being served my meal my first thought was , " that thing looks tiny to be N . N " . then i bit into my sandwhich . yuck ! ! ! they dump big chunks of salt on everthing which made it all taste like i was eating a box of morton salt ( the salt the box ) but with no real flavor ! ! ! ! how in the world is it possible that one meal can have so much freakin salt but somehow still taste like a shoe ? i ' ve had frozen burgers from the grocery store taste better . guess what ? i would have enjoyed anything on mcdonalds menu better then the overpriced , overhyped crap i got at the so called " burger palace " . the next time i want to run my pressure up risk a heart attack from eating tons of salt , i ' m heading straight to to micky d ' s or burger king where at least i know the food tastes good i " ll get what i pay for . 
the artkitchen does everything right . the assorted panini ' s are simply composed of quality ingredients . the coffee is strong , the cupcakes are fresh , and the staff is friendly , young and hip . i owe my jd , and probably my first born , to this place . 
incredible food and service . the pasta was sublime , the wine pairing suggested by the staff was excellent . . . i wish i lived in nyc because if i did , i ' d be eating at lupa every night . 
like most reviews , i am between N and N stars for this restaurant . this restaurant has the overall feel of a neighborhood bistro . i love the clean white interior with black accents , black and white photos and the dark hardwood floor . unfortunately because all of the surfaces are hard , the accoustics are loud in this place . it wants to be this gem cute intimate setting , but indeed you end up speaking more loudly than you want to be heard by your date or friends . that said , the food is excellent well prepared , very fresh ingredients , seasonal and treated with respect . for this , i would give N stars , yet the portion size is more european in scale . my entree of the butternut squash ravioli had only N- N N N " diameter raviolis on the plate . thank goodness we ordered a salad ( to share ) and another appetizer because i would have left looking for a burger fix to sate my appetite . don ' t get me wrong here , i am not looking for N dinner entree size portions on my plate , but i think you can still make a dish filling without compromising the beautiful presentation . my date had the salmon which was perfectly cooked and the accompanying vegetables were tender crisp which is just how i like them . again , another beautiful presentation . service was on-point , prompt and attentive without being obtrusive . to sum up , N stars for quality of food , interior , and service . i would give N stars for accoustics and portion sizes . 
food drinks were great , the staff was very curtious , upbeat and friendly . the bar was bustling and fun . we don ' t get into nyc that often but we will definitely visit the park ave tavern again
loved this . the food and service were both great and we enjoyed the location across from carnegie hall . 
really good food . nice staff . the truffle fries are the best i ' ve ever had . they actually tasted like truffles . the kale salad was yummy . my husband is a burger expert and loved it especially w the aged cheddar . portions are a bit small so it is a little pricey cause you will need an appetizer w an entree , but it is worth it . 
this restaurant is really good to be in their neighborhood . they have great food but the only flaw is that it takes a while for seating and after u order , it take about half an hour maybe more for the simplest thing like grilling a burger or having a salad . that ' s just weird . . . and because this place is so small they should be working quicker because they have to worry about so many orders at a time . prices aren ' t that great . if u would order three burgers it would come out to like N in this case u might as well go to mcdonalds but that is just shit in a a sponge . they have good atmosphere and such but it a little boring . . . 
really mediocre dim sum . it was super close to our hotel and the service was quick , since they had just opened when we went . otherwise , the food wasn ' t great and the tables were too small to fit the dishes we ordered plus drinks plus the spice tray . food tastes like it ' s frozen and reheated . cheap , but wouldn ' t go here again . 
i consider myself something of a wing aficionado . a chicken connoisseur , if you will . in all my years spent pursuing the great american pastime of masticating chicken-wings , i ' ve never come across a place that rivals the crisp , tasteful crunch and savory flavor of cluck u . well done cluck u . you ' ve reignited the passion of bored parsippany poultry pundits , which had gone unkindled for far , far too long . highly recommend the sweet chili sauce . i ' d swim in it if i could . 
omg ! ! probably the best seafood and drinks i ' ve ever had . really , the absolute best . the smoked salmon ' sandwiches " are to die for , reynolds is a genuine host . go while you can still get in . charile
good food , courteous staff , good prices ( maybe except for dessert ) went on a monday at around N for a really late lunch and of course there was no wait . i had the grilled chicken club ( no mayo ) with their famous fries . the sandwich was great , although i wish the chicken would have been a whole breast with some nice grill marks instead of sliced up pieces ( but dont think i mean they served some deli meat chicken product , it was the real thing ) and the fries were simply great . i took a vanilla vanilla cupcake , a N layer bar type thing and a rice krispies treat . the N layer bar left alot to be desired ( should have went for the blondie ) the rice krispie treat was ok , but absolutely nothing special , but the cupcake ! oh man ! now this was absolutely excellent and youd be hard pressed to find a better one in the city . moist , butter , vanilla-y yellow cake , with a simply superb vanilla buttercream ( which was tinted green so i know what youre thinking as far as sugar level ) the buttercream was perfect . not at all too sweet , creamy , stiff texture , and a wonderful vanilla flavor . i could eat a few big slices of this cake , or maybe a half dozen cupcakes , yes it was so worth the extra calories . i will go back here , i really wanna try the spanikopita for some reason , and definitely the grilled cheese , oh and more cupcakes please ! ! ! yum ! ! ! go get the vanilla on vanilla buttercream cupcakes right now . the tinted frosting may cause apprehension , but i promise this frosting is no sugar bomb like N of the colored ones in the city are . what a great cake
amazing ! ! ! was visiting from out of town and unfortunately was still full from breakfast . still managed to eat the pork tacos . definitely a must when in ny
i have been to el vez several times over my tenure in philly . favorites include the different varieties of guacamole , the endless chips and salsa and the delicious margaritas ( best in pitcher form ) . the service at el vez is usually top notch , the last time i went was no different . the waiter was attentive , friendly , joked and laughed with us , made sure we had everything we needed , and was as much a part of our experience as he needed to be . he also kept the top shelf margarita pitcher specials flowing . i ' ve tried a few entrees at el vez - huevos rancheros , chicken tacos , and most recently the mexican chopped salad with steak cooked medium . oh . my . god . so much steak ! so delicious ! so worth it . and with the chipotle ranch . . . i just wanted to kiss this salad and make it my boyfriend . another bonus for el vez is the cute decor and awesome vintage photobooth near the back stairs . we always take a few pictures when we come here . can ' t beat that . the only thing holding me back from N stars was the hostess on the phone when i was making my latest reservation who acted like i was putting them out by bringing N people to their establishment to drink copious amounts , just because it was Npm . if you didn ' t want us to make our reservation then , you could have said no . . . but alas , i powered through the rudeness , and we had no other troubles . so worth it at el vez , since we always have a great time ! 
this is a super busy establishment so be sure to make reservations ahead of time its also very tight in there so be warned . the thought of eating any version of marrow made me shudder however the beef marrow oxtail marmalade may just be one of the best appetizers that i have ever tasted in my life ! another huge surprise was the fried chicken which was some of the best we have ever had ! the striped bass made me want to lick my fingers and i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place , its food or its service . we went with another couple to celebrate my birthday and i still find myself daydreaming about the fullness of flavor in every bite and dish ! 
um , never got to eat there . overly crowded and for what cuban food ? go to hudson county and you ' ll find the same food at a cheaper price . i can only say that the reason this place is popping because of its location . i really think they should start taking reservations so that there isn ' t a big safety issue in their restaurant when it comes to people waiting around . there is no where for people to wait and where they have you wait servers are walking by everyone with the food . it is so crowded anyone can easily sneeze or pass their germs onto the food . then they take your reservation and if its a N hour wait , they just say to come back and not they will take your number and call you . i feel that this place is highly unorganized and unprofessional . they need to come up with a better system . god forbid there is a fire and they have all those people standing around by the entrance exits . it was really insane . if they took reservations , they wouldn ' t have that overcrowded problem . 
i really wanted to try the paella and i was disappointed . for me it was more rice with seafood than real paella . the empanadas and calamari were good . the service was ok . . . the place itself is so small , i didn ' t fell that much comfortable . 
omg a whole menus worth of diner food for vegans ? ! i ' m overwhelmed by the selection every time and it tastes as good as it looks ! i ' ve had the philly cheese steak , the tuna melt , tofu scramble with fixins , quinoa salad , cheesy bacon fries , ice cream , cookies - lol you probably think i ' m a fat monster . clearly not all of this at once but it keeps me coming back . the servers are super friendly and despite my living in queens - if i ' m in brooklyn this is where its at . i brought my carnivorous friends and they were floored . loved it ! duh . i like the ice cream but i don ' t love it . it ' s more of a sorbet consistency than a creamy one . not like i sent it back though . . . it ' s cash only so bring it or you ' ll pay the fee at the atm inside ( although quite convenient ) . prime time on a sun . afternoon - waited Nhr to be seated . so don ' t think you can just stroll on in anytime . 
best food i have eaten in a rest area . fresh and organic meat and simple ingredients . i had a caesar salad with fresh grilled chicken and a grass fed beef hot dog . excellent quality . 
great place to go at Nam after a long night of drinking . service is good almost everyone is nice . but there food is freezer burned . and cigarettes are nine bucks . ehhhh just ehhh . but if you ' re within walking distance and your blacked out this is the place for you . 
we came all the way from manhattan because we heard good things about krupa grocery , and believe us , it was well-worth the trip on a rainy wednesday night . the food - the sausage dish and scallop dish - were both wonderful . the service was warm and friendly , and what ' s better than a really great glass of wine to top it off ? we will definitely be back there soon . wish it was in the east village ! 
well what can i say ? . . . i was expecting a lot more than what i got . i mean , nearly N for two small rolls . the rolls themselves . . . eh . they were very loosely wrapped , so everything was falling . the flavor was very much there though -- i enjoyed the spiciness . i got chicken , while my boyfriend got beef . to be honest , with all these reviews , i was expecting a lot only to be let down . the place itself was hard to find -- we went late december with construction up -- so that was kind of aggravating on its own . i ' m sorry , kati roll , but you didn ' t win my heart . 
this was my first time there with a friend . i ordered the kakuni ( pork belly ) and the akamaru ramen . decor - the place was pretty nice . didn ' t at all feel like a ramen place ( but i guess in a good way ) . we were seated at this bench which strangely enough was in front of a mirror so from time to time my friend and i would be staring into a mirror ( which was a little odd while eating ) . N N stars service - waiter waitresses were great . filled up my water without asking . food came promptly and they always greeted us with a smile . N N stars food - i don ' t know about anyone else but does the food kind of remind you of chinese food ? the pork belly appetizer was very tasty . came with N pieces of braised pork belly and N halved soy marinated hard boiled eggs . honestly , if you served this was served to me in another restaurant my first thought would have been " oh . . . chinese braised pork with soy eggs " . regardless though , it tasted pretty good . the akamaru ramen was pretty good . noodles actually is pretty similar to the ones they have at minca . noodles seem fresh and had good chewiness to them . normally i don ' t associate these noodles with traditional ramen noodles but it was tasty . amount of noodles was a tad on the light side . didn ' t care too much for the slices of pork on the side ( there were N thin slices ) . the saving grace as others have put it was the broth . it was flavorful yet it had this really light feel to it . i ' m not completely sold on it yet but strangely i nearly drank most of it ( which i never do ) . the main reason is because i hate feeling super thirsty afterwards ( which i am feeling now ) . N N stars i ' m not N sure i can rate this place over setagaya ( probably need to try it at least one more time ) and honestly i haven ' t tried mitsuwa so i don ' t have a great comparison for best ramen joint in nyc . at least this place in my opinion is better than rai rai ken , minca and momofuku . 
my first time ordered delivery from this place . the food came out very fast . food still hot and tasty . i tried N dishes , pad ped pha duk kana moo krob . the crisry pork here is the best crispy pork compare with other thai restaurant in this area . can ' t wait to try more of their food . 
a real gem . i ' ve been dozens of times , and almost invariably have felt charmed , satiated , and delighted . i could almost give it N stars , which i think should be reserved only for places that soar on all levels time and again . it almost does - so close . in fact , if it wasn ' t for a few isolated instances , i . e . - not being asked if my girlfriend and i wanted dessert before having the bill hastily put in front of us ( i was so looking forward to the pineapple gelato ! ) , being treated with less attention ( to an almost startling extent ) on the one occasion i went in by myself , and that one time when the mussels were significantly under-seasoned , i would in fact give it N stars . here ' s why . the food is apparently australian . i only know this because my girlfriend has a friend who knows the chef , otherwise i would describe it as rustic modern american with the occasional asian twist . for example , mussels in curried coconut milk broth with chilies and cilantro . indian ? not really - the big hunks of crispy-in the-outside-chewy-on-the-inside torn bread isn ' t an east-indian kind of thing , or thai or any other asian cuisine that i can think of . i ' ve seen other asian ingredients on the menu . i ' m not going to rely on memory to list them off - the risk of being both pretentious and incorrect in the same breath is too great . suffice to say , the food has a playful mix of ingredients . and it works . i ' m a chef , and therefore critical of restaurant food , especially when a concept misses the mark or is just plain amateur . five leaves is one of those places where the food is consistently so delicious , beautiful , playful , sophisticated , comforting and satisfying all at the same time that you never really have the time to make a philosophical assessment of the menu and it ' s execution . ok , i ' m fibbing , a bit on occasion i take a breath and exclaim to my fellow diners ( normally my girlfriend ) how delicious , smart , and satisfying it all is . but , this happens as a sort of eureka . the joy of devouring artful and well-seasoned food prepared with love and without pretense causes me to bubble forth , in a manner resembling genuine laughter , with compliments . like when a great idea pops into your mind , seemingly " out of the blue " , and you rush to share it with all and sundry , as a matter of course that precludes the luxury of self-consciousness . also , by now i ' ve been enough times that reading the specials menu , in rapt attention , has become routine . and yes , some philosophical assessments are made . in short the kitchen has they ' re shit together . the service is also very good . the servers know and understand the menu in a way that feels natural . in other words , it ' s never occurred to me that one of them needed to memorize the menu and relavent knowledge , like a dutiful but uninterested student - they just get it . it ' s a smart and well-oiled team . attentive , and at times very impressive . one server in particular , don ' t know her name , has a special talent for serving couples . she has a way of giving you enough space while still being attentive , and making everything feel special on a level that ' s , yes , artistic . finally , the decor . so , ok , there are a lot of hipsters here . if that ' s not your thing then be warned . i don ' t really care . the decoration is charming and cozy , a little quirky - similar to the overall look of the service team good-looking , friendly , tasteful , and a little quirky . for music they have a record player , which plays a range of music depending on the bar back djing . i ' ve heard new order , t-rex , the cure , some weird but very cool electronica tracks i didn ' t recognize , and lots more all befitting the general character , in a way that ' s neither specific or obviously intentional , of the place itself . whether your a foodie or just want a good meal out , definitely check this place out . 
one of the hottest latino restaurants in new york city . the friendly staff is dedicated to excellent service and the colombian and south american food will satisfy the pickiest appetite . the red beans threaten perfection and the mango mojito is my favorite drink in town . the restaurant is beautifully decorated with accents of latino culture and history . the amazing murals can stand alone in any art studio and the music selection caps off the overall latino experience . ( from a blog post earlier this year - philvelez . blogspot . com N ) 
love this place , it ' s worth standing in line even on cold days . excellent burritos and the best gingerbread pancakes ! 
the bestie and i made a good faith effort to go to the j . crew sample sale one weekday afternoon . but after walking in the rain only to find a line wrapped around the corner , we abandoned that idea and decided it was a good evening for some ramen ! we yelped it out ( yelp it out ! yelp it out ! ) and found ippudo ! i had heard of it before but never really ventured to try it . . . especially when i was already such a fan of totto ramen . ( and , i think i prefer totto , actually ) nonetheless , the bestie and i trudged through the rain and found ippudo . it was around N N p . m . and was busy but not packed . i put my name on the wait-list but we were seated in less than N minutes . although we were seated at a large communal table with two other parties , we were too hungry to care . i will say , however , that the dining area was a bit too loud for my taste . not sure if it ' s a sporadic thing . maybe there are hours when it ' s more quiet , but when we were there it was uncomfortably loud . probably not the best place for a first date . the menu wasn ' t all that easy to decipher , but the wait staff was helpful enough that they answered our questions in a satisfactory manner . my goal spicy . the bestie ' s goal vegan . they satisfied us both ! we started with a cucumber appetizer that although refreshing , was somewhat bland . the " spice " on it wasn ' t so spicy but was kind of mild and very underwhelming . not that it was bad . . . honestly , i think my taste buds were just far too excited about the spicy ramen to the point where the refreshing cucumber appetizer ( mainly to satisfy the bestie ' s vegan restrictions ) was dead on arrival . i can ' t tell you the name of the spicy ramen noodle dish i ordered . but what i can say is that it was amazing . it hit the spot . the only downside was the mushroom or some other ingredient that was kind of hard to chew - very stringy and chewy . i just placed it to the side of the dish . tmi ? still , the soup was delicious and the noodles were on par . plus , if you leave enough broth in your bowl , you can order more noodles ! and duh , you best believe i did . needless to say , we were stuffed and satisfied ! who needs a j . crew sample sale when you ' ve got ippudo ramen ? ! eating is more fun than shopping anyway . fatty
thank you tim for opening your resturant heart and creating such an awesome uye evening ! big praise for the welcoming and attentive staff . loved being greeted by the bartender as i left the polar vortex chill and entered into the seemingly gothic-celtic warmth of ordinary . how very unordinary indeed ! signature cocktails are a must ( that is if you didn ' t come for one of the stellar international or local brews or N N price bottles of wine ) . i started w a crispin ' s hard cider and leaned into the spicy elm cocktail- autumn in a glass all snuggled around those ample ice cubes and orange peel mmmmm ! extensive menu so peruse with care . the eats are limited but prepared w care and love . from the tangy spicy grainy mustard to accompany the charcuterie of cured meats , cornichons , sharp cheese , figs , toasted baguette . the grilled cheese is oozing of warm buttery velvety cheese nestled btw grilled just right amount of crunchy bread w a side of the home made tangy ketchup . pure comfort . bravo for sharing your sources of such scrumptious delectables- hormone free berkshire pork , dartagnan meats and organic free range chickens from menonite farm in pennsylvania . yah ! events weekly cocktail specials . warm atmosphere . adept and friendly staff . cozy interior . all the makings for a perfect experience . 
love this food ! they deliver though and i wish i could order it for delivery . the one girl who brought it to us one time ( blonde curly hair , loud annoying voice ) literally walked in our house while she was handing us food ! then started talking to my children telling us stories about her two kids ! mind you , this girl looks like she might be N , and she was telling me our children should get together for a play date ! ? it took me forever to shoo her out the door and even then i was afraid she was going to come back . unbelievable ! i want to order food from here so badly , but have avoided it because the last thing i want is her in the house again ( delivery wise ) if we do get delivery we just get maninnoes now . their wings are very good too ! 
joined friends for late night . waited awkwardly for N minutes before finally getting my own cutlery from another table . . . and my own chair . ordered a red sangria given a white one and told " they taste the same anyway . " hello ? we is person . if you prick us , do we not bleedz ? i would rather has cheezburgerz at shake shackz . 
the ramen was really good but nothing spectacular or memorable . i definitely prefer jin ramen in harlem to this though . the whole atmosphere at ippudo seemed gimmicky and the long waits ( even on weekdays ) aren ' t worth it . waiters waitresses are all super nice and friendly though . 
i tried both grimaldi ' s and lombardi ' s and by far grimaldi ' s destroys lombardi ' s . best pizza i had in new york city . cash only . this is perfectly brick oven cooked think crust new york style pizza . . . but it ' s still slightly doughy to where you can fold it in half ! we got pepperoni and sausage . . . bomb . nothing really more to say here . try it with a brooklyn lager . a must see when you visit new york . 
N star for cheap N star for delicious N star for service -N star for being dirty
food was ok . . . service was terrible and it was not crowded . my wife made it clear to the waiter she did not want anything fried so he suggested something and it came out fried . told the server i wanted to see the waiter . . . he never showed . my wife ended up trading her dinner with my friends dinner . they have pitchers of sangria that have no or very little alcohol . . . the waiter should tell the customer . . we did not realize it was a byob until it was too late . i ' ll never go there again
go for late brunch or expect a hefty wait for a table , which is ok because you can hang out at the bar until you get one . great beer selection . great food . friendly , attentive staff . suicide onion rings spicy and delicious . fried pickles dill spears fried to perfection . beware though , they are hot as molten lava when they first come out . fight the urge to sink your teeth into one of these puppies right away . . . or brace yourself for unbelievable , searing pain . port richmond platter perogies with deliciously grilled bratwurst and sauerkraut . all i can say is wow . so good . check this place out for a relaxed atmosphere and great brunch spot . they also have a beer garden , but you can only order cans and can not order from the regular food menu . ( 
i have been there for many times and i am a fan there . i have tried the bbq and hot pot , and both of them are worth trying . but i did not try them at the same time , because that would be too much for me . i think it is a good place to hang out no matter you go in a small group or in a large group . and the employees there are nice too . by the way , if you go there on your birthday , show them you id , and you don not need to pay ! free birthday meal ! ! ! 
solid place good pizza
amazing food with an ever changing menu . truly home style cooking at a reasonable price , zero pretense , and great " hole in the wall " ambiance . definitely try the pig ' s foot , the steak , and the rabbit when it ' s available marrow when it ' s on the menu is a bit greasy
my wife and i found this place here in soho while out here on a show in new york . i can understand why the reviews rave about this place . first off the service is incredible . within the first N minutes the chef owner introduced himself and visited with us for a few minutes . the wait staff is extremely attentive but not overly so . the food was . . . well . . . amazing . nice portions , superbly prepared and you could tell that the place does not skimp on the quality of the ingredients . what ' s more the prices are good . the place is small , seating maybe N people i ' d say , so reservations are recommended . they are cash only and byob . that being said this will be one of our regular stops when we come to new york . it was truly a great dining experience ! 
as a student at the new school , i ' m constantly looking for reasonably priced , delicious , and hip ( because new school ) eats in the Nth-Nth st , N-Nth avenue radius . hu kitchen is directly across the street from the new university center building , and it has tree stumps for seats , so i was expecting it to be flooded with students . it wasn ' t . i opted for a combination plate , which includes an entree and side for somewhere in the N range . i opted for the chicken and broccoli . now , due to my own stupidity , i ordered a N N chicken instead of the N N chicken that is usually included in the combo . so , i ended up with a N lunch and too much chicken for one person . nevertheless , the chicken was very well prepared , and i ' m not going to let my personal grudge against chicken portions sway my overall opinion of this place . the broccoli , on the other hand , was surprisingly spicy . i couldn ' t put my finger on what the spices in the broccoli were exactly , but it was a bit overwhelming . i went back a few weeks later because i was still in new year ' s resolution diet mode and i wanted some overpriced vegetable juice between class . they didn ' t have the green juice with added apple and ginger that normally pacifies vegetable adverse people like myself . i ended up getting whichever green juice in the display case looked the healthiest . taste-wise , it wasn ' t as good as liquiteria . it was a bit more . . . watery ? but still , N well spent , i guess . overall , if you ' re in the union square area and you have a lot of money and absolutely need some chia-seed , kale , coconut water , green juice bullshit come here . if you ' re with a friend who has a lot of dietary restriction , just loves being generally picky , or is from los angeles , this would be an excellent place to bring them . 
friendly stuff . great service too . 
fast and delicious . both the chicken sandwich and the burger i had were cooked to perfection and the girl who takes orders was nice . cajun fries are serves in a white chinese food container and inexpensive . i literally brought some to work and while they are spicy , everyone enjoyed them . one of my coworkers even got up and went there on his break to buy two more containers for the office and himself . chicken was juicy and lightly marinated . burger was cooked to my exact specifications and had some chipotle sauce in it too . superb ! overall its got great prices , food , and service . wish it was there all the time ! 
i went to the downstairs restaurant called feldermaus which shares the same menu as cafe sabarsky but not the same decor . even so , it felt very euro except for the latin american waiters . it was nice to hear french speakers at the table next to me and english accents at another . i had a glass of elderflower spritzer ( holunderbleuten ) which was very nice but a bit too sweet for my palate . for lunch i had the frisee salad with bacon and hard boiled ( but runny yolk ) egg . i love a perfectly cooked egg . it came with a healthy serving of good bread . it was all very very good . the service was professional and swift if a bit cold and stand off-ish . it wasnt cheap though . N w o tip for a light lunch . but , it was in manhattan . and it was close to the met where i had gathered a good appetite after looking at all the ancient and medieval artifacts . the desserts looked really good but i obstained . which i kind of regret now . 
ate here many times , always great , bartender told me everything comes in fresh everyday . . good to know . . . be back soon . . 
very warmly received here on a rainy night . quick , friendly , unobtrusive service , in a nice informal setting , and very tasty merguez and zattar bread . turkish coffee also hit the spot . 
overall , the midtown east location is not as good a dining experience as the park avenue south location . i ' ve been to this location about N times in the past N-N years , and the staff , particularly the hostesses , aren ' t as professional or friendly . however , the food has been decent , particularly their smoked salmon , when it ' s been available . 
great quality , fair prices , love to eat in the back garden area
i would give N star but their fish was very fresh so N . i came here for an early birthday lunch . i ' ve been dying to come here for a long time but avoided it because i was told it ' s very expensive . lunch prices , however , are very reasonable - N for sushi samshimi chirashi which includes tip . i had a bad first impression due to the difficulty of making a reservation . my father called to make reservations but was told they are full and should call back the next day and check for cancellations . he called the next day and was told by someone else that a reservation is not necessary . then i called to confirm if reservations are necessary and if they were in fact full . i was told they do not take drop ins and are full . i told my mom what happened and she called and sternly asked them to confirm their policy . with an attitude , they said it ' s reservation only and have a spot open at noon . moral of the story have someone make the reservation in japanese . service is very very attentive and they use top quality tableware . i got the sushi sashimi set . all except the tuna was good . the geso , uni , and ( sea scallop ) himo were standouts . why did i give this place such a low rating ? they gave us old rice which was a little dried out and not good . don ' t be the first to come here for lunch to avoid this ( or send it back which is what i should have done in hindsight ) . were trainees working ? a few of the nigiri fell apart when we picked it because they were too loose . the rolls were starting to separate on the plate and fell apart when picked up . is this amateur hour ? the eel roll was also covered in too much sauce . the rice is the most important part of sushi . even if fish is fresh , there is no point in coming back . this place was not worth the trouble . 
really good , fun burgers . taco burger was fantastic . the meat is very flavorful by itself , and mixed with seasonings , it was great . buns for this burger were a hard taco filled with cheese , wrapped with a soft taco , and maybe fried ? then filled with tomato salsa , guac , and lettuce . burgers come with a heap of seriously good waffle fries . we also got onion rings , which were super thick cut and very simple and good . service is chill and can be slow . it ' s a relaxed hipster place , so not surprising . prices aren ' t awful , but not very good . i can get a better quality beef burger at burgermonger for half the price . the draw-in for this place is the fun and new burgers each month , but be prepared to spend N for a burger . also first check-in gets you a free lager . can ' t beat that ! 
i always enjoy a dinner at balthazar . . . this time we tried breakfast on a saturday morning . limited breakfast menu . . . but that ' s okay . the four of us all had something different , and all four of us really enjoyed our choices . it ' s a little expensive for breakfast . . . but it ' s balthazar and you get what you pay for . it was all very well prepared and hearty . 
healthy , inexpensive and delicious . definitely worth trying . 
first , i would like to say that the food was delicious however , the service was very bad . when i first walked in , the hostess was very unpleasant . i have been to many restaurants before n never have i seen one that didn ' t smile at customers when they walked in except this one . second , my waitress , rox , failed to tell us that lobster was sold out when she first came over to take our drink order . because of that i had to change my orders after waiting for her for N minutes to come over and take our orders . i have never been to a restaurants where server didn ' t introduce his or her name to customers when taking their order except this one . this will be my first and last time dining at oyster house . the experience was not what i expected gathering from all the positive reviews . 
we decided to stop in here for some cannolis and the lady behind the counter who was tall and wearing a santa hat was nothing but rude . the whole time i was there she was starring me down and giving me dirty looks . the cannolis tasted old and soggy . i don ' t see why people rant and rave over this place . with a rude staff always . . and non tasting pastries . . i ' m all set . . won ' t be back . 
these are not your typical ballpark franks ! i thought the price was a little high , until i saw the size of these bad boys . it ' s a meal in a bun . i had the cincinnati skyline - chili , cheese sauce , onions - wow . can ' t wait to get back and try some others . 
i love the hot dogs ! i have been coming in for years ! the boys and the owner are very cool people . . . . . great place to go with the family along with the kids . . . . . 
great little place , from the hospitable waiters singing italian , family photos covering the walls to the excellent food . linguini with garlic and eggplant , prosciutto , i could go on and on . yummy ! 
service service service , wow . the food is amazing here . seriously . the pizza , the pasta , the wine , top notch ! definitely coming back . 
inconsistency with food orders . i used to order from this place almost weekly with a group from work , but no more ! ! crappy service from the owner on a recent order placed is unacceptable . ordered N sandwiches , but only received N . spoke to the owner who frankly called me a liar . you would think the owner would care about their business , but i guess not . i have better things to do than cheat a small establishment out of a N sandwich especially when cheese steaks are a dime a dozen around here . customer service is what makes or breaks a small restaurant business . avoid at all cost ! ! 
excellent pulled pork sandwich and crispy fries . couldn ' t even share the side of ribs because we were so full already ! 
sooooooo disapointed ! ! ! ! after dining at cubanu for almost Nyears and really trying to stay positive regarding service , food , entertainment , i have to say it should just close up . the staff was , well , what staff ? ? but the one young gentlemen we had was probably the most " removed from this earth , angry , unhappy human being i have ever experienced as a waiter ! ! it is extremely upsetting that i paid over N and the food was horrible and the service was worse ! ! ! ! this was our Nth attempt and this will be our last . we will never again go to cubanu and if you do . . . . . maybe you should be part of their answering service because that is the only thing and not really that you may get a response to . horrible horrible horrible . . . . disapointed cuban chef myself ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i haven ' t been to beau monde in oh so long , but i ' m desperate to come back . damn philly for all the variety of delicious and non-delicious foods this city has to offer ! beau monde would make a great date spot since the place is casual , yet romantic . the menu can be a bit confusing , but the servers are more than happy to help you . 
awesome staff manager made our big group of out-of-towners very comfortable and welcome ! the food was wonderful everyone seemed very happy with their meals . salads were delicious , also loved the scampi and gnocchi . the portions are not huge , but with this kind of upscale italian cuisine , i don ' t think they should be . we were quite content . atmosphere is nice , old-world italian flair . cute place , right near princeton but not too college-student-y . highly recommend ! ! 
liked this restaurant ' s accoutrements , coziness , atmosphere in general , and can vouch for the chicken dishes and bruschette ( w funghi ) and bottle chianti we had last night . plus the tiramisu . dug being under the elevated f train trestles . good job . 
best chicken and rice i ' ve ever had ! got there right at Npm and line was already super long ( good sign ) . didn ' t wait too long though , about N mins till i got my food . huge portion of rice , chicken and pita for just N bux . they have their own signature sauces on the side of the truck . i ' d recommend the white one and the red one is extremely spicy . definitely worth the wait ! 
anthony ' s cheesecake has the potential of being a better restaurant . their food is good and fairly priced . they are very artistic , and can sometimes create present wonderful plates ( specially for dinner ) . they make the most amazing and delicious cheesecake ( i recommend the new york style with cherries ) . overall , this is a good place with good food . the only thing i suggest to them is that they need to improve the service . as N N N they have improved the service . the next time you are there , go for the chicken cutlet , broccoli rabe and mozzarella , simply amazing ! 
i went to the bar for an esports event . the host was promised a time frame and about N people showed up for the event . we all purchased food and drinks and were somewhat rowdy , but we weren ' t causing a disturbance . techno music was blasting and there were a good N-N people who weren ' t there for the event that we were being far louder than us . a frat group heckled a few of us and called us ' fucking nerds ' and then the manager kicked us out and accused us of being too loud and driving away st . patty ' s day business . food was mediocre , service was shit . will not be going back . 
it might be the only restaurant for all-you-can- eat hot pot in new haven . N , if you are looking for spicy flavor , nothing is spicy over there including the spicy soup pot and the sauce . N , lamb is good , beef is very dry for some reason . actually baby octopus are good . they also have cow stomach , tonghao and jinzhengu , but they do not have beijing cabbage and potato noodle . they have big shell and small shell , small shell are frozen . they also have tofu and other stuff . N , service is of course very bad , everybody already knew . you have to wait at least N mins for your soup pot coming . if you have any question , you can not find anyone to ask , meanwhile when you pay the bill , the cashier asks you for the tip with a long face . the waitress with glasses is the only one that is able to smile . N , all the sauce are no flavor including majiang , not sure where they get that kinda majiang , it is very insulting to majiang . so if you oder a non-spicy soup pot , you are in trouble , the sauce is no flavor . if you order a spicy soup pot , you are still in trouble , the soup is just with some salt and looks dark and unpleasant . 
very solid chinese restaurant with surprisingly good ( american ? ) service . the spice level is customizable on nearly all the dishes , so everyone can be happy . i particularly liked the dan dan noodles and beef tripe , but i didn ' t have complaints with any of the dishes i ' ve had during any of my N visits here - and i try new dishes every time . 
this place is friggin great . i live a block and a half away , and i sense danger . the pizza is really exceptional . i had the king harry ( mozzarella , tomatoes , prosciutto , basil ) the boy had the spectacle ( speck and red onion ) and his cousin got one of the special pies , the meat hook ( sausage , chicken , mushrooms , mozzarella ) . we each swapped a slice out so we could sample a little of everything . the sauce is amazing and flavorful , the sausage is some of the best i ' ve ever had , and the crust is absolutely perfect . one pizza was a perfectly sized meal . nope , it ain ' t cheap . but , if you wanted a mediocre N slice of pizza you could find it over at one of the windows on manhattan ave . you ' re coming here for quality , locally sourced , delicious pizza . 
stopped in for a quick drink while i was in town . the martini menu was limited , so without being able to craft my own concoction i asked for a tom collins . when have you ever seen that on a menu ! so at N years old i tried it for the first time and it was delightful . we also tried the beer chocolate dessert which was tasty ! it would have been better if was made to order instead of being refrigerated , but still delicious . we were also offered some yummy app sample - homemade chip with chorizo and some delightful sauce . atmosphere was quaint and formal without being pretentious . kid of a art deco gatsby feel . 
we were walking by and discovered this quaint little spot last sunday . the atmosphere was very nice , and we really liked the food and the cucumber lemonade was amazing . the waitress suggested we order a few dishes , since the restaurant serves " small plates " . we sampled several of their dishes , including a charcuterie plate , sliders , and a tuna tartare that was excellent . our favorite was a beet and goat cheese . everything was really creative , and the service was amazing . the deserts were pumpkin themed , and delicious ! we were really happy to find this little gem ! 
i love this place ! every single thing i have ever eaten here is amazing . i tried the asian shrimp po ' boy and it blew my mind ! it was spicy and super flavorful . the thai chicken lettuce wraps and fries are also always a good option . the asian tacos are not the best but they are still pretty good . the service was also great . 
every dog i ' ve had here has been amazing . a must for everyone . don ' t miss this hidden gem . 
extraordinary experience . the food , service and atmosphere all amazing . i will return . great place for a special occasion . . 
i love this cafe ! the food is excellent . the red velvet pancakes are fabulous ! i enjoyed my food . the waitress was pleasant and prompt . 
probably the best sushi i have ever had . service was good and food was amazing . 
love
we went back here for brunch again and love that it ' s open nice and early . eggs benedict and just scrambled eggs with their rye toast and potatoes . we were not disappointed ! 
this is the best brunch i have ever had in my entire life . yes , you have to wait a long time ( it ' s a tiny place ) , yes the kitchen is small ( it ' s right in front of you ) and yes they are slightly understaffed at times . all of those things still make it worth the wait because all the food is incredible . the brunch menu is inventive and everything very fresh and wholesome . it is not expensive and fills you up for the whole day and i can never finish what i have eaten . the servers have always been incredibly nice to me . some are not a fan of the homemade ketchup , but the biscuits , frittata , really all the baked goods are simply amazing . i always order off the specials menu . when my boyfriend and i go there we always have a hard time ordering because everything is so yummy ! this place has seriously ruined my taste for all others . i have become an even better cook because i cannot find any place to rival this one . i have recommended it to everyone i know living in philly . sadly , i moved away from philly and now live in la . i am not lying when i tell you that i actually cry after going out to eat at other brunch places because they are seriously not that good . i miss it so much and can ' t wait to eat there again ! ! ! addition after reading several other bad reviews , i ' m appalled . i have never experience all my friends love this place and when i ' m in town , i have a hard time not going there daily . i had the pear and blackberry glory cakes my friend had the italian ( ? ) frittata--the biscuit was awesome , so good . 
i got the pork burrito . it was terrible ! the burrito was full of pork fat . it was terrible . 
the lunch special is a hit ! i ' ve been here twice and have had great results . the first time i had the chicken with pineapple red curry with the asian chicken wing and the fish cakes . . . wow ! it ' s a lot of food . . . . the curry was great . . . just the right spice and the chunks of pineapple was a nice touch . the second time i had the chicken massamam curry with the asian chicken wing ( can you tell i really liked that one ) and the veggie tom yum soup . the soup had kick ! ! it was very good ! ! totally cleared my sinus ) anyway . . . the decor is fresh , hip and a mix of antique feel and clean modern lines . i really like the joint and plan on hitting it up for lunch again soon ! ! 
get the fried fish skins , fish tofu , cuttlefish paste . 
it ' s worth the effort to locate this hidden gem behind the Nnd ave construction . our group tried two flambees ( gratinee and provencale ) , salads and the tourte marianne . the flambees ( or flammies ) are delicate crusts ( pizza in style but much thinner and lighter ) with creme fraiche , carmelized onions and bacon plus additional toppings as you choose . much lighter than a pizza with more subtle flavors . the tourte marianne seemed to be cross between a pot pie and a shepherds pie but the filling was so well flavored ! ! we finished with a delightful tarte sucrees ( sweet flambee ) with creme fraiche , sliced apples and cinnamon . had an opportunity to chat with the owner ( originally from alsace ) and an intern who is working with him for a year ( also from alsace . ) they seemed to be genuinely down to earth guys trying to provide a nice experience with foods from their home . i ' m a fan of the food and the experience in this neat little spot . 
so good . so , so , so good . 
N not recommended , it ' s so dirty ! ! before paris open , i always go to banh mi saigon because i have no other choice , it ' s near my school and i love to eat banh mi . but now thank god paris open , why ? let me tell you my experience in saigon . . . one time i just got off school and i was starving because i didn ' t eat anything all day , and i didn ' t have too much cash because i just paid for the books so i decided to go for a vietnamese sandwich because it ' s cheap and i knew it would fill my stomach . so i went there to order the the N , the pork banh mi . the bread was pretty big for that price , the pickled vege was not bad but the meat was too salty . i then ordered a che ba mao , the viet N color dessert to go . when i got home omg . . . that night was one of the worst night in my life , i had the most painful stomaches and diarrhea for N hours . . . . then the whole night my stomach was on and off in pain for a very long time . . . i almost slept in the bathroom . . . . the worst thing is that i had to go to my first class of the semester the next day so i had no choice but taking a lot of pepto bismol . i didn ' t know if it was the sandwich made me sick or the che made me sick , i knew that was all i eat all day because i was so busy running around getting books in the campus . . . but i am sure it was this place that made my day so unforgettable . i am definitely telling all my friends about my experience and i ' ll never go again ! ! ! 
just left here and had pretty neglectful service . normally we have the lady with the bangs who is friendly and attentive , but today that was not the case . at first i was letting the servicers slide because they were busy , however when it began to slow down and i saw the two girls stop and talk multiple times , stand around and space out and blatantly walk by our table ignoring us then i got mad . not only was our order wrong , but no one ever came over to ask how everything was . we went our entire meal without drinks and mine never came with a buiscuit , which are delicious and one of the main things that makes me want to go in there . oh , and because no one ever came by to fill our waters or ask how we were doing , i never got one . when the waitress came to drop off our check , and i was dying of thirst , she threw it down without a word and walked away . no one said " thank you " or " bye " as we were leaving , not even our waitress who rung us out . even though at this point there were multiple tables open and plenty of time for them to try and save face . ill be goin to fitzwater cafe for now on . 
good place , not great but pretty good . 
i had the veggie omelet . it was beautiful , full of fresh veggies and delicious . my wife had the feta and cheese omelet . there must have been N cups worth of feta on top , no kidding . great big portions of food and the best home fries i ' ve ever had . very friendly and prompt service . go here and enjoy ! 
this place is insanely busy but in the best kind of way . the coffee is amazing - tons of different foods and desserts , it ' s a great stop and pick-me-up any day . . . even with a busy line
reliable and delicious for a quick bite . i dig the special ketchups , chipotle and japaleno are winners . good prices on beer too . great stop for midday drinking
this was a great spot to duck into while wandering chelsea on a recent visit . i have to admit i was skeptical when we walked in - a walk up counter ? the vibe was definitely crunchy - felt more like i was in eugene or santa cruz . i had been looking forward to uppity table service and numerous table-side refills of coffee . good thing we stuck with it - the food was outstanding ! my husband had the lox platter - lox came on his choice of toast ( wheat ) , slices of radish , capers , dill , onion , tomato and lemon - yum ! i had the grey dog breakfast , with bacon french toast ( with loads of fresh berries ! ) potatoes with roasted red peppers and poached eggs ( cooked medium , perfectly ) . we had been marching around the village and chelsea all morning and had worked up an appetite - we both cleaned our plates ! as for the lack of table-side coffee service - i got over it quick - the guys running the front of the house were more than happy to refill our cups with strong coffee when i brought out mugs to the counter . 
just okay . . . parking is hard . . . . it is kind of dirty . . . it ' s better if you go to a food chain restaurant . save your money and go experience a philly cheese steak elsewhere to avoid disappointment . 
how does fogo de chao compare to churrascaria plataforma in nyc ? 
last night my friend and i wandered in here hoping to have a couple drinks and dinner . we were greeted with a rude hostess . initially , we wanted to sit on the bar but the only places left were too close to the door . we got up and asked to sit in the corner of the seating area . mind you , dinner was going to be over N minutes after we entered . we were told by another rude girl that we can ' t sit there as it ' s reserved for someone . we sat at another table and asked our waitress about the corner . she told us " of course ' you can sit there . we sit at our table anticipating our dinner . i open the menu and see that there are no vegetarian options without cream . i know that i am difficult but i have been vegatarian since the age of seven and have never had such a problem . i have travelled a lot , lived in three different countries and have never ever encountered such a thing . i even find food to eat at a steakhouse ( salad ' s , fries , etc . ) . i asked the waiter what he could do and i guess he didn ' t really want to help so he said i can have the side of steamed broccoli . this made me really angry . it was obvious he didn ' t care , didn ' t want to be bothered . i ended up eating just two bread rolls ( also cold and obviously not fresh ) . i have waitressed for years and i have never told someone i can ' t find them something to eat . i ' m sure they could have made me a big salad with tomato , onion , etc . i told him at the end he should have at least suggested this and his answer was that he suggested i get the salad minus the meat and dressing ( which would leave only lettuce ) . i asked to speak to the manager and the waiter said eh was the owner . i almost laughed in his face . i hope people read this review and realize what a farce this so-called bar restaurant really is . i
you won ' t find better food anywhere in the newark area . lawyers , feds , and business types alike frequent this restaurant regularly . but don ' t feel out of place if you ' re not wearing a suit since there is no official dress code and the owner gus is just a really wonderful guy he personally welcomed my party to his restaurant and gave us complimentary desserts simply because i expressed a curiosity about what the carrot cake tasted like ( it looked really good in the display ) . the portions are huge , the food tastes wonderful ( i had the lasagna special with greek salad , my husband had the lamb steak special with steak fries ) and the place was spotless clean . even if you only come here once , it is an experience you won ' t forget you will be greeted by people who truly do appreciate your business and seem to authentically care about whether or not you are enjoying your meal . food was cooked to our specification , service was top notch , free refills on our sodas was an unexpected but very much welcomed plus , management was superb in taking care of all of our needs and making us feel at home . i really do love this place as does my husband and our four kids . the only qualm i have with this place is its hours they should really be open for dinner ( unfortunately , they are only open for breakfast and lunch and close at Npm not to mention not being open on the weekends ) . 
i don ' t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu . it ' s all really good . the staff is nice , too . they don ' t take reservations , but they ' ll call you when your table ' s ready , so you can hang out at one of the bars down vanderbilt while you wait . for anyone that ' s experienced a wait at totto , this is a great policy . don ' t forget straight cash , homie . 
i ' ve only ever had their falafel laffa , so i can ' t comment on the quality of anything else . that said oh my sweet baba ganoush . whenever i ' m within an hour of being hungry and within N blocks ( even long blocks ) of this place , i make every effort to stop by . the falafel laffa is enormous and delicious and at , at N . N plus tax , an awesome bargain . i usually go at odd hours so the lines are rarely long if there are any at all . sometimes i get the food to go or stay to eat on a repurposed bowling lane . 
racist manager , discriminatory practices . manager slewed racial comments at and assaulted my family after they picketed outside against the racial comments . 
lucali has the most amazing , home made tasting food . the calzone is out of this world because of the local cheeses used and the slow cooked sauce they give you for dipping . one of the best places in brooklyn for food and atmosphere ! 
don ' t get the fried chicken here , it ' s not that good , i ' ve definitely had better . you must try the chicken with rice clay pot dish . i ' m not sure what they infuse into the rice , but it ' s just the right amount of flavor . this place gets N stars because you ' re forced to spend a minimum of N and because the waitress was rude and unresponsive . i ' d probably come back again for the chicken with rice clay pot dish . as indicated on the menu , it takes N minutes to prep ! 
harvest on hudson . terrible food , clueless service , rude staff , front door greeter more interested in showing off tatoos than being courteous to guests . the view is great and wonderful setting but after paying for a pricey meal , it ' s not worth it . fyi , other reviews saying you ' ll never find or be able to contact a manager to offer feedback . that ' s obvious
this place was godsent one night i desperately needed some grub after a night of serious alcohol consumption around the corner at posh . the place was packed , so my friends and i opted out of table service and ordered directly from the menu for take out . the empanada menu offered an extensive variety making it somewhat difficult to decide on the spot . i ' m not a pork eater , so i stick to either chicken or beef . to date , every meal i ' ve ordered has been good and my recommendations to others have been well received . 
i just has the best service i have ever received from any restaurant . the owner and the servers were all very nice and welcoming ! and to tip it off , sushi was delicious and met my high expectations . i will definitely be back and highly recommend this place to others . prob make a reservation though just to guarantee a seating . also this place is byob ! ! it ' s truly a hidden gem that you must try ! 
came on a weekday about N N , it wasn ' t busy , so i was happy about that . the waiter got the orders mixed up , i ordered mashed potatoes and my brother ordered french fries . at first she expected us to scrape the sides off into each other ' s plates , we looked at her like she was crazy , and then she said she would get new mashed potatoes , lol ! i enjoyed the portion size . the waiter wasn ' t too attentive , and that annoyed me because it wasn ' t crowded . if you want good bbq , this is the place . 
its small but the food is good ! they ' re always open , service is quick . i went straight for the mac cheese , didn ' t realize it was such a popular item but omg , i savored every bite , i just wish it was bigger it ' s a small plate but it was delicioussss . fun , hip , friendly staff . open Nhrs ? ? will i come back again ? possibly . especially for brunch ! 
food is always good , not excellent . service is always solid . for some reason , our tables are always awful . it may just be luck of the draw . seems to be most popular for breakfast lunch brunch . all the egg dishes are of quality . sides ( like sausages ) leave much to be desired . having lived in france , i view the ambiance and decor as an homage to paris more than an emulation . in that regard , it ' s charming . i do wish they would put a bit more effort into making the food truly standout - parc has the potential to be the balthazar ( in soho , nyc , go there ! ) of philly - similar size , theme - but needs to put more emphasis on the quality and preparation of the food to make it exceptional . this is simply a matter of effort , not of creativity , as the dishes they serve are classics . out-of-town guests who are not familiar with paris or ny generally love parc . take them for brunch if they are staying the area . 
great sushi restaurant in orange . i had the sashimi for two last night and i have to say every slice of sashimi are fresh and tasty ! 
another mediocre italian restaurant . nothing different or interesting here . too bad because the space has potential
fabulous authentic greek food ! ! ! this little spot is bold with great flavors . knowledgable host that describes the layers of a food like you were sitting in the kitchen watching the preparation . if you are a true foodie you don ' t want to miss snack ! 
ruth ' s chris is one of my favorite steakhouses as you know that you will consistently end up with a delicious steak ! love their chop salad , mojitos and their strip steak ! also , they mike a fine after dinner espresso martini ! 
very over rated ! ! ! ! food was ok . . . . needs help with customer service . 
best sauce ever
i am a huge foodie and have lived and dined in nyc my whole life . . . when it comes to food , bars , or nightlife i really know my stuff . what else is there to do in nyc ? ? what do i have to say about forno ? wow ! ! ! this place is a pizzeria . . . but the food is better than N stars . they make their own bread , pasta , and cheese . . . . do i even have to continue ? i have ate there so many times and have even used them to cater some events , and the ingredients are nothing but the freshest . the foccacia robeola pizza is something truly unique and out of this world . . . . and their daily specials are to die for ! i live in brooklyn . . . the home of famous pizza , and i travel N minutes out of my way to eat at this place ! its great ingredients mixed with passion and love that makes every pizza and every dish so special . if you cant get your ass to italy . . . this is by far the closest you will get ! 
cooool
we ' ve been going to mr . sushi for over N years , and have not been disappointed yet . the people are always warm and welcoming , and the food is wonderful . i ' ve been spoiled . 
great place to eat , but it is quiet noisy . 
food N stars service N stars waitress was patient to make recommendations to me despite the long line that was building up , and also introduced the different kinds of peppers ( yum , yum yum ) . it looked like there ' s also a good selection of beers to go with your sandwich . bf and i shared a sandwich but we really should ' ve each gotten one ! so good ! there ' s a good number of combinations that are on my list to try . ( the only bad thing might be the location . . . it ' s out of your usual drive and there ' s no restroom around ) 
great place for drinks . went with family from out of town , and had a great time . would recommend the kaperinhas . everyone is friendly . met a couple of ladies there and partied the night away . will definitely be back . 
been going here since N , the portions have gotten a little smaller they raised the prices by a dollar . however , the food is even better then i remember each time , always have more then enough leftovers to take home . i always get the lamb since i don ' t eat chicken , at N a plate . best spot in the city for late hours , especially for the weekend . deserves N stars because they ' re consistent , makes great food at a decent price i ' m willing to make the trip from queens ! 
pylos is a totally wonderful surprise in alphabet city in the east village of nyc . . . great food , a caring staff and a lovely atmosphere . i particularly loved the restaurant ceiling covered with pottery . . quite beautiful . . . . truly a wonderful dining experience ! 
this place was almost splendid . good drinks , amusing window into the mens room , oustanding history , good company , frinedly staff , and most importantly , open on whatever night i went to the anchor next door and it was closed , woohoo ! i can ' t actually remember why it didn ' t get the Nth star , but the review is fair . 
we came to dominic ' s for a first communion party , and i was very pleasantly surprised . there ' s not a lot of ambiance going on here , but the spread of food was spectacular . we started with a cold antipasto plate , which included some nice caprese bites and decent-quality meats and cheeses . from there , we went to hot antipasto , with some stuffed mushrooms , stuffed clams , lasagna bites , and calamari . each of these was pretty tasty . then came a pasta course , with nicely cooked ( al dente ) penne ala vodka . then came a salad course , which was good . and , for my main course , i went with the chicken parm , which i found to be delicious . the cutlet was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside , there was just the right amount of cheese , and the sauce was nicely balanced . the service was ok . we had a team of servers working with our large party , and some were better than others . that said , they were reasonably efficient with clearing plates and getting the food out . everyone in the family enjoyed our meals , and we ' re happy that we came here for our event . 
a friend took me the Nnd night they were open for business after he ' d eaten lunch there that same day and was eager to return . the decor is sort of a " hip meets elegant , " the service enthusiastic , but the really big deal is chef edwin ' s food . we ordered the " N course chef ' s tasting menu , " and it was sublime , probably one of the N best meals i ' ve had in my N years in manhattan , do yourself a favor and go now while tables are easy to get in a month or two after it gets discovered i suspect it will become more difficult to get a reservation . 
great food and great family running the business . highly recommended ! 
my wife and i held a large event here but spent the minimum for room rental and services because we were on a budget . the upstairs room is quite beautiful and the event was a hit but , sadly , we were very upset by how the union league treated us . staff showed up half an hour late , without apology , for an appointment to go over event details and generally made little effort to disguise their disrespect for us . in addition , our purchased services were reduced day-of despite our contract and we were refused a discount ( any breach of purchased services just ended up being subsumed by the minimum room charge ) . the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth , so i wouldn ' t recommend doing events here . perhaps this is simply a function of what we spent ( which , believe me , still wasn ' t cheap for us ) , but the restaurant was fully aware what were were willing to spend when we made final reservations and didn ' t seem to mind at the time . disrespectful and unfair . 
have been to this bar for a few months now , great vibe , great price drinks , amazing happy hour and the best bartenders in new york city , peter has my beer poured before i even say a word . great guy . totally a classy place to meet work peeps ( and non-work ) . kale chips suck ! ! do not order . but again , peter made it right . dudes try not to fall in love with the hostesses ( i failed ) . 
service was absolutely wonderful ! i had a server named brendan weng who really was friendly and inviting . the general tso ' s chicken was to die for ! my new favorite spot . 
a great brunch spot ! one of those hidden gems in fort greene that is hidden in the cut . 
they have the best dumplings around and reasonable as well . i can not wait to return . 
ate there a couple times . the service was fine both times . the atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant and quaint - a retro , italian-deli vibe that makes the food even more appetizing . - salads are great , it may seem like a given but their dressing is really good . - pizza was a tad burnt but very tasty and filling , which is arguably better than most in the city . the tomato sauce was particularly flavorful . - i also enjoyed their pasta . overall nice dining experience and good food , which is sorely needed in a neighborhood void of appealing restaurants . 
milkcrate is a new hot spot in my opinion right on girard ! great record selection and a banging shot of esspresso ! sounds like there is more good stuff to come more food and live music ! i can ' t wait ! 
i had been told by a friend who used to live in ny to go to junior ' s and get the cheesecake . i shouldn ' t have had such high expectations though . . . of the food or the service . i went for a quiet lunch and ordered a bottle of pellegrino , a corned beef sandwich , and of course , a piece of cheesecake . the sandwich was small for the price , but i guess that ' s new york . it was good though . the cheesecake was not at all what i was expecting . and maybe it ' s just an east coast west coast thing . i like my cheesecake nice a creamy and rich . but the cheesecake that i got at junior ' s was , well . . . cakey . it wasn ' t creamy at all . it had more of a cake texture than what i ' m used to . i didn ' t even finish the whole piece since i didn ' t enjoy it very much . but maybe that ' s how they do it in ny - maybe your cheesecake really is a cake ? my favorite part though was when i got up to go to the restroom . i was by myself , but i left my coat , scarf , and a shopping bag at my table . i took my purse with me . i still had some pellegrino left and i was planning on just sitting and relaxing for a bit before i headed out again . well , when i came back to my table they had cleared everything . i guess the fact that someone ' s coat was still there wasn ' t clue enough that they were still around . oh well . if i ever make it back to ny i won ' t be coming here . 
i would love to give this place more stars because when they ' re good , they ' re really good . unfortunately when they ' re bad it ' s almost amusing . a few months back i stopped in for a salad it was beyond rotten . much to my dismay i didn ' t realize this until i was a bite in already . i brought the salad back without hesitation they made me a fresh new one , but without an apology . granted , i don ' t need a hug or for an ass kissing but i wouldn ' t have minded a " sorry " for picking up food , driving back to the office , having to come back then not having enough time to eat said salad because of the travels . i still went back though , because this was the first time it happened all other salads sandwiches i ' ve had there have been above average . since my previous experience i ' ve been content as i always was prior to the rotten salad incident . . . that is until my office requested delivery for breakfast . every time we call we get a different answer . i wish they would just say they delivered or don ' t . i ' ve received a slew of answers when i call everything from you need to place the order by Nam , we don ' t start delivery until after Nam , we stop delivering after Nam , even though you ' re calling at Nam we can ' t have bacon egg cheeses to you until Npm . i ' m not upset with the fact if they don ' t deliver . . but they do deliver never have any consistency with it . basically what my long-winded ass is saying it this place is hot cold . it ' s either fucking awesome or literally rotten . and depending on if the counter girl has her period or not you may get delivery . . or not . 
if you ' re here , you must absolutely order the bbq pork bun ! something about the addicting sauce that ' ll keep you craving more . the bf and i saw a waitress piling her rice bowl with bbq pork drenched in their special sauce and immediately asked if that was offered on the menu . . . sadly it was only an ippudo employee perk . the ramen here was delish ! i had the shoyu and i believe the bf had the akamaru modern , and i enjoyed my shoyu so so so much . it was a perfect and wonderful balance of the ramen and the tasty broth . the broth was packed with pork flavor goodness , and it was thick but not too thick , tasty and yet not too salty . the noodles were fresh and chewy , and yet at the same time also crunchy . . . one of the best ramen places i ' ve been to . . . . the wait is well worth it . my bf had to refrain me from licking the bowl . 
the tasting menu with wine was very good and unlikely many the portions were decent size . the staff was helpful and professional making it by far one of the best dinners . 
returning from a trip to china , i ' m surprised by how many vegetarian chinese restaurants there are in america . it was impossible to be be vegetarian in china . " just eat ! " they told me . i ' m a sucker for general tso ' s " chicken " . i admit it . this is the best i ' ve found in philly . maybe the best anywhere , but that ' s a bold statement and i ' m kind of a timid dude . ( not really ) the other dish i highly recommend is the sesame garlic noodles . not quite the jing jing dan dan noodles of palo alto , but good enough to coat my esophagus . no Nth star because service is often slow , but again , compared to restaurants in china , this place is on the ball . don ' t get me wrong , i love china and the chinese people were wonderful , but without tipping , what do they have to work for ? certainly not high wages ! 
the baklava , although not made with any honey , is unbelievable ! soaked in just the right amount of simple syrup and packed with buttery cashews layered in crisp fresh phyllo dough this baklava is a truely heavenly experience . 
mango and passion fruit dome with rosemary and white coffee ice cream - it ' s amazing how much wonderful flavors can be incorporated into a dessert . perfectly cooked and flaky , the cod was the highlight of the meal . ) , organic buckwheat , ginger sauce slow braised kobe beef cheeks w ricotta gnocchi and blue kale delicious . cleanliness very nice . it was very nice looking , eloquent , and luxurious . 
definitely suggest their gyro ' s , so good ! 
this places was fantastic . can ' t wait to go back . the fries were amazing and the turkey tails were delicious , perfectly smoked . highly recommend this place . perfect for day drinking . beers are in mason jars
my friend was in the mood for mexican so we traveled down to fonda for their happy hour this past friday . two things to note their guacamole is a must try ! the portion is huge and the ingredients are fresh . fonda ' s margaritas are amazing , especially the mango margarita . it ' s not extremely sweet as you would expect it to be , which i found to be a pleasant surprise . i will definitely be going back for more ! 
thai food is my favorite food ever . this place was great ! came for lunch and it was pretty empty . negative - tvs in the restaurant . distracting and totally unnecessary . of note - cash-only . but they have an atm in the back of the restaurant . best food drink sake papaya salad - amazing ! ! spicy and sweet and sooooo good . fried pork belly - we got a plate to share with the table . not only was the pork belly crispy and flavorful , but if was brought to another level with the fried basil . a must-try . pad thai - i know i ' m boring , but it ' s my favorite and it was great here ! definitely want to go back ! 
if you are seeking a cheap eat , meaning literally a very cheap then this is your place ! the reason why i have stated my title , is because the place seems very unhygienic . but believe me , i did not feel sick afterwards and i was able to eat a very satisfied dinner for extremely cheap . dumplings are N and the pancake is something like N . the food is very nice and quite promptly served . compared to many other restaurants in china town , the service here is also much better . if seeking a cheap and tasty dinner ( remember it is not a restaurant more like a take-away ) then this place is your option . 
this place looks so divey from the outside but it ' s awesome inside . yeah it ' s definitely a gritty , down to the nails kind of place , but it ' s really a very good spot . the food is fantastic and you have to try the mac and cheese . the pulled pork is freaking bomb . and the food is so so cheap for olde city . 
delicious pizza place . was there with my brother . i got buffalo slice , and garlic nuts . i like this place . 
love this place they have a great vintage atmosphere . live jazz music , good drinks , friendly staff , my favorite place in the area . . . 
amazing pizza ! ! 
i like this place because it is really awesome ! just be sure that you are hungry when you ' ll go there because this is really a market with variety of flavors and many temptations ! 
excellent hoagie ! i ordered the godfather which comes with an assortment of cured meats and very well dressed with toppings and the mild hot sauce . it was extremely tasty . they had a very large assortment of craft beers which you could help yourself to in their very long span of refrigerators . the place didn ' t have much seating , but i was able to get a table at the kitchen bar . i will definitely be coming back if i am in the mood for a sub . one last thing , the subs are pretty large . N could easily work for N people . 
the prime rib was terrible . 
good food , but delivery absolutely horrible . ordered through grubhub and , although we waited patiently , no knock on the door . called about order and they said they had come and we hadn ' t answered . . . asked us if we were going to pick up . even when we asked for delivery again , they failed to come . they do not offer delivery ! 
went here for easter brunch last april and just reviewing it now . everything my friends and i ate was delicious . loved my french toast , loved the lamb stew , cocktails were great . just a bit too pricey . just don ' t see why . it is chelsea , but who knows ? either way . a good place and definitely a great brunch , just wish it were a litttttttle bit cheaper . there are better brunch deals in the east village and worth the trek for all of you who live on the west side . 
i thought the food was okay here . people raved about this place so i figure to give it a try . i didn ' t think their food was anything fusion . most of their dishes were tapas and they had about N-N entrees to choose from . we ordered their kani pizza , fried chicken which was kind of bland , their lobster citrus salad was just okay . tasted just like oil and vinegar salad . we also had their korean bbq wraps and their steak was a bit tough . the service was horrible as well . they weren ' t even attentive when our drinks were done and water needed to be refilled . we had to call the wait staff several times . would i go back to this place ? no . it was a place to try once and said , okay . i gave it a try . ) 
if i could give josh N stars , i would . he knows his burgers and it shows . when i tell my friends from out of town that my favorite burger in philly comes from a tiny food truck , they don ' t believe me until i take them there to try one . when i worked at drexel , i converted all of my coworkers to the gospel of spot . the burgers are always juicy . the ingredients are fresh . the combinations are creative . josh is passionate about what he does and you can taste it in his burgers ! plus , he ' s like a machine at the grill . how he manages to keep conversation going when orders are flying in and still manage to get the orders out so quickly is beyond me . he also knows all of his regulars and makes it a point to learn the names and orders of new folks so that when you come back , you feel like a celebrity because he greets you by name . if you ' re looking for a quality burger at a great price , head to drexel ' s campus and get yourself a spot burger ( or a roquefort , my fav ! ) . oh and follow him on twitter , especially in the summer--the lobster roll is pretty solid , which is saying a lot from a new england ex-pat ! ) 
i wasn ' t hungry when i arrived so i had simply ordered an appetizer . we went all family style and before i knew it , i was devouring everything up . the green sauce is scary good and the chicken is cooked to perfection meat off the bone good . the seafood salad , fried bananas , sweet potato thingy were all good as well . the staff is very attentive and they even have a coat check to keep your umbrella off their velvet ? lined bench style seating downstairs . my friends enjoyed the decor however i felt like a caged chicken . gonna be back but next time , i ' m staying upstairs . 
my cousins told me they love burrito box so i was excited to try it , but boy was i disappointed ! my boyfriend and i ordered N different types of soft tacos . the spinach one was ok , the chilli con carne was greasy but had some flavor and the bbq chicken was flat out disgusting . do not order the bbq chicken . the tacos had lettuce that was soggy and fell apart . the guacamole was just ok . the chips were stale . i see many people like this place , so maybe they had a bad day . . . but i will never go back there . really cheap , crappy , flavorless mexican food . the service was the only good thing . . . fast ! 
not good for families . we came here for brunch on a saturday morning . the food was really good but there ' s plenty of places to go on the island with equally good food that ' s not so expensive . our waitress was very slow had zero personality and looked like she did not want to be there . although they do have high chairs i would not recommend this place for families . the atmosphere is a bit uptight ( not very good if you have active kids ) . and the waitress would place everything right in front of your kid ) . i had a two year old and she put the drinks , hot plate , and even my steak knife in front of the kid . i would have given this place one or two stars if i did not enjoy my food so much . 
best little whole in the wall in town ! ! ! 
let me preface this by saying that my bf had never had ramen that had a meat broth and we finally found a place that had a chicken ramen choice ! we were both super excited to try this place as it looks authentic ( hole in the wall ) and the pictures of the food looked sooo delectable got my usual miso ramen with pork as i do in any ramen place and he got a chicken one . man ! it was saltyyyy ! i love salt to the point where it ' s unhealthy , but this was craziness ! i lost count of how much water i had . unfortunately it wasn ' t good for my bf either and i was disappointed bc we were hoping to find a place we could go together for ramen . . ( luckily we found that place in brooklyn zuzu ramen ! ) the extras were pretty good i guess , but i ' ve def had better . would try again if i was around the area . 
your food was incredible and i want to come back despite the photos of the rats leaking on the table . did someone set you up ? your still one of my fav breakfast spot in the city . 
superb service , great food . much less touristy feel than one block away in times square . a great find , very reasonable for great food in midtown . can ' t wait to go back . 
turano ' s pizza pasta grill , lyndhurst , nj i just had to have some thin crust pizza before i left nj , and i was told that turano ' s pizza in lyndhurst , nj is very good . i ' m italian and fussy . . . need i say more ? it ' s a cute small pizzeria and pasta grill and seats about N people . we ordered a thin-crust pizza with sausage , mushroom , and pepperoni . in about N minutes , we were served a beautiful oven-hot pizza with just the right amount of sausage , mushroom and pepperoni . i judge my pizza in two ways . . . N for it ' s crust - must be thin and crispy on the bottom . . . . and N for the oil dripping off the pizza while you eat it . oh yes , it has to taste good - usually the flavor of the sauce is the deciding factor . i give this pizza a N on the richter scale . . . it ' s tasty , thin , and has a good amount of olive oil dripping down the slice as you eat it . i ' m going back for more on my next trip to nj . 
come for the beer , stay for another . food ok . 
this place has the best shish kebab and dessert i ever had . in summer you can even sit outside . they did a groupon at one point and the deal was great . i higly recommend this place ! 
i have gone to the red onion several times as i live very close in burlington , on this particular day they had a turkey lemon barley soup , i asked for a sample thinking i would get a tablespoon of soup so that i could taste the broth to see how pronounced the lemon was . the kid behind the counter said " we don ' t give out samples " , confused i asked why i couldn ' t sample the soup and he said " because of the homeless people , they come in and ask for a free sample and we don ' t know if they will buy anything " , as he said this i thought it was pretty ridiculous and the fact that they had free samples of scones out on the counter added to the ridiculousness of the situation . i ended up trusting their word that it was good and getting the soup and a sandwich anyways , the food was as it has always been good , nothing fantastic . however , i have a bad taste left in my mouth , not from the food but from their costumer service and their values , i do not want to support an establishment who has such an established paranoia surrounding the less fortunate and are so greedy and cheap that they are not willing to spare a tablespoon of broth due to the chance that the person might not buy something . several other sandwich shops on church street , stone soup and new moon , openly provide costumers with samples of soup and i would recommend going there . 
we ate here in early january for brunch with friends . the food was great . i got the omelette with sausage but would recommend the chorizo next time . it was a little bland and needed some flavoring . our friend got the chorizo and it definitely was more flavorful . my husband got the special and it was amazing - so flavorful . my biggest complaint was the service . we waited almost N-N min for the waitress to pick up our credit card . we finally gave up and put enough cash together so we could leave . 
enjoyed a thursday night dinner outside here in upper montclair . i had the classic two beef taco meal and was thrilled with surprise of soft shell inside the hard shell taco ! the soft shell didnt add much but the combo was fun . i do love hard shell tacos . i also love taco bowl salads except the one here - the sides were very vertical and not sloped like others ive had . the result was you ate layer by layer and couldnt dig and poke around the dish . super quick and friendly service . byob and in walking distance to a liquor store . i would come back . nice place . 
best beef noodle soup in the area . you can also try the braised pork on rice or pan fried beef bun . and the price is fair . 
i love thai food , i ' m not going to lie , i do like it here but they always rush me even if there is hardly anyone there . food is pretty good , except they are not consistent . 
been going there for years ! i like the japanese menu and a friend likes the chinese . a good place to dine ! 
bridgids is my favorite place to eat and drink . the beer selection is fantastic . while the choices are vast , the draft selection in particular always has special beers that i ' m surprised to even find on draft at all in the us . with their new chef they ' ve now also evolved into a wonderful eatery with incredible italian pasta and other dishes . it ' s now a destination for great food . but really the beer is king here , with wonderful and unique discoveries . while other places have some belgium and micro beers , i always am thinking " i wish i were drinking beer at bridgids where they have the best selection of the best stuff . " the service is and has always been great . staff here are real people who love beer , love food , and it shows . they are knowledgeable about both , and are looking to help you find what you ' ll really enjoy . the prices for food are very reasonable , and i think for the quality of beer reasonable there too . at some " fancy " restaurants you can spend more than N on a cocktail , but here for less you get the best beer in the world from near and far . strangely enough it ' s also extremely kid friendly , where they treat your kids as real people . my N year old asks to go , then gets a plate of plain pasta , a bowl of bacon , cranberry juice in a fancy chimay glass , or whatever he dang well pleases . while the place is great , the wide variety of folks who make their way here are always interesting and fun . the big j shaped bar curves the seats around and encourages the frequent cross-bar conversations and banter that make my day . this combination of things are why you go out to eat and drink . this is a truly unique and wonderful place where i love to bring out of town guests and family . . . you ' ll love it to if you give it a try . 
i have dined at cafe orlin twice . once last year , and a second time early today . before checking out a few apartments , my friend sara and i were craving brunch . we arrived N minutes before Npm . we were given dinner menus . sad because sara and i wanted to try the pumpkin pancakes ! we settled for hummus and salad . it was good , but still a little disappointed that we had to order dinner . brunch should stay going til Npm on sundays ! ! 
clean restaurant , good pizza , overall a nice place . N stars
first , check out the cool wood wall art . i would say that it ' s definitely a sign of the eclectic sandwich findings available at cheeky sandwiches . my sidekick and i dropped in to take lunch to go and found super friendly service and wonderful lunch options . there ' s sandwiches , scrambles , buttermilk biscuits , and of course the always delicious ben-yays for my little friend . they packaged our meal really well , even wrapping our iced ginger tea in foil to keep it frosty our order osyter po ' boy . this was delicious . all the ingredients super fresh . the oysters were nicely sized , not the teeny ones you usually see in po ' boys . and the natural flavor of the oyster came through--the mark of good quality and fresh shell fish . oysters were cooked perfectly and the bread was amazing . pork sandwich . perfection . marinated pork chop , caramelized apples , onions , special mustard . the sandwich had that deep porky flavor you want in a chop with just the right amount of sweetness for sides we got the scramble with muenster and salmon , ben-yays and biscuits . all had very authentic flavors . great spot . glad yelp came through when i was searching for lunch options in the area ! 
i found this place on a random search . they recommend reservations and they are strict on it ( complete with reservation code and telephone reminder that you must not be late or your table will be let go ) . i didn ' t know what to expect after that . their menu is a little overwhelming ( i mean , there have subsections of certain fish ) ! it ' s a little pricey but well worth it . this place is amazing ! the rolls were some of the best we ' ve had . the seaweed , rice and fish just melted into our mouths . we didn ' t recall any place that had softer rice , if that ' s even possible . all the sushi sashimi , especially the uni , also melted into our mouths . the nicest surprise came at the end in that true to its authentic japanese culture , there is no tipping allowed . yet the service was impeccable . i cannot wait to go back ! 
what this neighborhood needed- great atmosphere , good beer selection , and good patrons ( unlike the previous kellians bar ) . this is one of those bars that helps define a neighborhood think standard tap or north star . best time to go happy hour . i try to avoid it friday and saturday nights though because it gets ridiculously crowded to the point where you can barely move , and really really loud because of the acoustics of the room . 
decoration is so good . . . they have buffet . 
this place is pathetic -- i would give zero stars if it was an option . they can ' t ( or won ' t ) even pull off a burger king " have it your way " . i went with two friends on a monday night around N . there were only a few people there , mostly at the bar . one of my friends wanted onions on his burger , but the waitress said they didn ' t have any . he persisted and got the waitress to admit that they had shallots . he asked to have those on his burger . she went to the kitchen to see if that was " possible " . she came back and said they wouldn ' t do it . then he asked for mayo on it , and she said they never have mayo in the place . we left . 
let me start by saying i ' m a certified chef that has N years of experience . i am very generous with my reviews . i enjoy applebees for christ sake . . . i went with my family to get a pepperoni pizza , ( which apparently is a margarita pizza with pepperoni from what the hostess said ) and a white pizza ( with red onions , mushrooms and olives . ) we got two small pizzas , bruschetta appetizer , two unsweetened ice teas , two glasses of chardonnay and two glasses of brooklyn beer . the tab before tip ? N ! ! ! are you kidding me ? ? . . . i wouldn ' t mind if it were an authentic pizza from nyc . . however the amount of pepperoni on the pizza was pathetic . i could count the amount they put onto my pizza on two hands . most of the pepperonis being on one damn slice alone . do your cooks have parkinsons , lombardi ? the white pizza was so gross with the curdled cheese from the ricotta pumped onto it from a star shaped pastry bag . way way wayyyyyy too much ricotta on the white pizza . i found myself scrapping it off onto my plate in a curdled , gross mess . not to mention the olives were so sporadic that it was almost a chore to bite into a selection of the three toppings at once considering they were way too generous with the onion and mushroom . ( . . . surprisingly enough . . . ) the only saving grace was the basil chopped on top of it which covered up a little of the mountain of ricotta . the only thing i can say i enjoyed was the bruschetta and beer . although to be perfectly frank , i can make a better bruschetta without even trying . want me to prove it ? go ahead . i ' ll send you a recipe personally from my own kitchen . please , send me a pm on that . i will help you . do it . i promise . i ' m just angry that you charged so much from your sloppy pizza . it ' s crap . . i swear it ' s horrid and it gives me hope that you can thrive as a pizzaria and do such a horrible job with poor consistency . just because you ' re italian and post pictures of your family does not mean you make a good pizza . as an ohioan i can say your pizza only has the advantage of being baked in a stone oven . you better keep it that way because that is the only thing that keeps you from losing your restaurant . also , cash only ? haha . . . nice . keep cook ' in the books asshats . 
i ' m the ' double meat ' guy and i ' ve been going to this place for quite some time now . why is that ? because not only is the service top notch- friendly employees , really fast service - but also because the food is so amazingly tasty and fresh . i usually get the steak plato , but i ' ve also tried the chicken and pork . they are all good . the cut of meat that this place uses is superior to all other places i ' ve tried . they have a huge line going out the door , but that line usually moves pretty quickly . what impressed me most is the care and attention to detail , not to mention the painstaking work the employees put into making your burrito or taco or plato . this place has gotten very popular through word of mouth for it ' s fresh ingredients and great service and simply delicious food . very very deserving of the N star rating . 
we went on saturday night before the theater and had the N course pre fix . it is a very nice setting with excellent service . both the lobster salad and the lobster soup were outstanding . the highlight was the pasta course with the ravioli being one of the best dishes any time any where . the tortilini was also very good . we had veal and lamb for the main course and they were both well cooked and seasoned . desert is the only reason i hesitated on the N stars . it was very good but not quite the very high standard of the rest of the meal . it is certainly not cheap , but overall for the quality of food and the service it is not unreasonable . 
was very hungry and got back exactly that . . . 
food was fine . but yelp deal was not honored . my voucher said one per person -- not one per table , as the restaurant management insisted . i am a lawyer who reads things carefully before purchasing . i am not mistaken on this . i did not pursue it , per my husband ' s entreaty to drop it . but this left a bad taste in my mouth , and i cannot recommend anything but the food . even so , when ordering , beware of extras not included in price of entree . 
a hidden gem with excellent food and top-notch service . the hummus and falafel were excellent starters and the chicken schwarma platter was one of the tastiest i have ever had . definitely recommend wafas for lunch or dinner and will be coming back for more ! 
the food was amazing . we came for brunch and shared the banana blueberry pancakes and the brickyard benedict with lump meat crab . i was initially disappointed because the crab was mixed in with the spinach , but it was plentiful and so delicious ! every bite was better than the previous . really was one of the best meals we ' ve had in a long time . and the drink selection is great too . 
i wish i could give cafeteria negative stars ! ! i have been going here for years and went here last week and was appalled ! ! there were N of us at brunch and my friend found a piece of hard plastic inside of her fried calamari and i found a rubber band in my soup ! ! there is nothing like taking a big bite of soup to pull a rubber band out of my mouth . disgusting . the worst part about the whole thing was how the manager handled it . he gave us attitude , refused to comp our meal and said " things like this happen . " " things like this " should never happen and if they do you should apologize and offer to pay for their meal . i will never return to this restaurant and am spreading the word to make sure that no one i know or any of their friends ever return as well . 
every trip to nyc requires the morning expedition to find breakfast . for some reason this place didn ' t pop up in yelp , even thought it was a block from our hotel . we were on our way to a bagel place on Nth or Nth , but just happened to pass this place . at first we almost didn ' t go because of the prominent mentions of " gluten-free " , then we noticed that those were just options . i had the breakfast sandwich -- delicious and so filling , it lasted me all day . husband had the breakfast wrap with turkey -- he liked it save for the slightly sweet salsa they use . coffee -- delicious , plentiful , and refillable ! only minus it was colder inside than outside . on a brisk november morning . we ate in our jackets and scarves . 
upon browsing the bodhi tree menu , i saw one of my all-time favorite thai dishes drunken man noodle . i was thrilled that a place besides sea ( oh , sea , how i miss when you didn ' t play your music so loud that you had to shout to the others at your table ) offered this dish . the water service was good and fast , something that is very important when it comes to eating spicy thai cuisine . the pumpkin dumplings were tiny but good . the wings were piping hot to the point that when you bit into them , steam came rushing out . the drunken man noodle was fantastic and very spicy . i ' m normally excellent when it comes to spicy food ( i ' m that chick who pours tabasco on everything and anything ) but this was exceptionally spicy . still good , nonetheless . the noodles were covered in chili paste ( hence the spice ) and i got mine with mixed seafood so it came with mussels ( yummm ! ! ) as well as jumbo shrimp and calamari . keep in mind , the restaurant is very small . it took forever to get our check , even after asking three different people . but service is relatively good and the food does arrive relatively fast . i appreciate any place that knows how to truly achieve spicy food . 
very halal indeed . . . 
the people here are sooooo nice ! the food is good , but i must say that it ' s such a pleasure to be served by nice people . also , shout out to the gentleman at the cash register for solving a dilemma for this out-of-towner . thanks ! btw i had the pancakes and corned beef hash . both were very yummy ! N N N
cafecito has been one of my fave informal and fun eateries for several years . the cuisine is top-notch . the staff is super-friendly . and it ' s a fun neighborhood . my faves the steak with chimichurri sauce , and the cuban sandwich . 
it ' s Nam pacific time and i ' m craving halal food . it ' s that good . sometimes i wish i lived in nyc just so i can get on the subway and get a plate . . . combo plate for me with plenty of white sauce and a little bit of red sauce . if you are brave and want to " man vs . food " it , get plenty of red sauce and try to finish all your food . but be warned , it kills the flavor . 
live within walking distance i ' ve only been here twice . shame on me . . coffee was great one morning i stopped . . for dinner the second time i had the sonoma sandwich , which was turkey , ham , roast beef with cole slaw and russian dressing . it was so filling and delicious . huge sandwich too . also tried the beef empanada which they warmed up for me . it was flaky and good . very friendly staff . . a few friends also recommend the thanksgiving sandwich , which i will try next time . 
if you don ' t mind the dank , subterranean feel of this place , you might enjoy your meal here . we got ceviche mixto ( shrimp , scallops , calamari , cucumber , cilantro , avocado , aji amarillo ) godo portions but not tart enough salmon brulee ( cream cheese , brown sugar , strawberry-ginger , leche de tigre ) very tasty empanada criolla delicious , recommended butternut squash and bartlett pear soup ( with sour cream , truffle oil , croutons ) delicious , also recommended macarons and dulce de leche ice-cream just okay for drinks , we got la pulperia cocktail ( riazul silver tequila , fresh mangos , aperol , misri syrup , peppermint , tangerine oil foam ) and the coquito passion ( mount guy rum silver , don q coconut rum , passion fruit , pur e , agave nectar , fresh mint ) . of the two , the coquito passion was definitely better . i docked a star for lousy service . i don ' t know what was going on that evening , but it took forever to flag down someone whenever we needed them . it ' s not nice to be ignored . 
while reading this review , please keep in mind that i might be biased because i am a little bit in love with mark simmons . as the old adage goes , the way to my heart is through my stomach when i taste the food at kiwiana , i want to run into the kitchen and give the chef a hug . if he didn ' t have ready access to very sharp knives , i might have even tried . the man just knows how to cook . the corn and crab soup is rich and delicious , and will warm you up as the weather grows cold . the scallops are nothing short of incredible they quickly converted my girlfriend who occasionally likes to pretend she doesn ' t like scallops . i wanted to savor every luscious bite of the manuka and marmite-braised baby back ribs , but i ' m afraid i took them all down in minutes . the lamb is so tender it ' s absurd , and the fried chicken is about as good as fried chicken gets . if you ' re feeling a bit adventurous , check out the smoked and pickled mussels . they arrive in a jar of the pickling liquid , and are served with a nice sourdough and house-churned butter . i must admit i ' m more partial to mussels served hot , but even so , we were basically drinking the juice after quickly polishing off the shellfish . they were pleasantly tart and briny , and like nothing i ' ve had previously . kiwiana is not big by any means , but i think the manageable size keeps the quality high . the small room gets nice and lively , but the soft candlelight and warm atmosphere makes it perfect for a date . the staff is friendly and attentive by their recommendations , you can tell that they enjoy the food immensely as well . on my last visit , i think mark somehow deduced it was my birthday , and he sent out a glass of champagne and came by to say hi as well . it ' s this kind of personal touch that takes kiwiana up a notch . with such well-executed food that is unique not only to park slope , but also to nyc , i plan to be here often . 
i was so relieved when i found out nizi is still in rutherford . the food is great , and the service is excellent . the two waiters who have been there forever , dan and dominic , are very friendly and attentive . the prices at nizi are very reasonable , and the sushi is fresh and delicious . the cooked korean food is also delicious . the restaurant is small , but worth waiting for a table . we drive past many other sushi restaurants to get to nizi because we haven ' t found another one that even comes close . 
love it there
giving fives stars because we loved everything . the dishes we had sea bass , abondigas , shrimp , brussel sprouts ( fantastic ) string beans , rice . great spanish wine list . great service . enjoyed sitting downstairs in the more quiet area . upstairs was very crowed and loud . 
even though i give it only N stars , i still like it a lot , and will probably be back for pre-theater bites , or when i ' m in the area and am looking for a place to go . it ' s right next to under sapporo , which is more like a fast food diner compared to hagi . hagi is more of an izakaya . the atmosphere is very laid back , it is run by japanese people , and the food is authentic . the waiters are busy and very nice . they have specials up on the board , and the potato spring rolls on there were really good . another review says they have uni specials some times . . . must keep going back ! the prices are reasonable too . my only complaint is that the menu is way too small , especially for an izakaya . and they didn ' t have katsuo that day . but that ' s fresh seafood , so i understand that can happen sometimes . they don ' t have any salad items on there . barely any vegetables , for that matter . but what they had was very good , and the rice balls are huge ! it ' s not a nice restaurant with " interesting dishes " and such , but the atmosphere , food , and waiters remind me of japan enough that i will definitely be coming back many times . in the end , i had a pleasant experience there ! 
i love going to this place for brunch because it ' s low key , within walking distance of my apartment and they have a great selection . i recently had their lunch menu and the food was great . the best part was that i walked out after paying the check and left my purse behind . our waiter chased me down half a block to give it to me . he was awesome ! ! ! 
las ramblas is a cozy place . great sangria , the patatas bravas were devine , friendly staff and i can recommend it to any tapas lover . 
i came to jungsik for my wife ' s birthday in december . manager sommelier kyungmoon waiter haksoo greeted us with our own personal menu . we had the tasting menu . not only was the food great , the wine recommendation was out of this world . jungsik by far was the best dining experience we have ever had , and we still talk about going back for the next birthday . thank you for the great experience . 
the food is amazing , but the people that work here are a joke . its clear that they are all very young and have no idea how to work together as a team . i think the name of the manager that night was angela . she was more concerned with how she looked then running her staff . 
fast . . . . juicy . . . . delicious . . . . just hit the point ! ! ! ! nice ambience and excellent service . . . . ! ! ! 
i love roberta ' s . sure , it ' s hipstery . sure it ' s kind of sketchy in that area . sure it ' s pizza . but it ' s damn good pizza . one word , beastmaster . gorgonzola , sausage , capers , mozz . its delicious . another one of my favorites is the guanciale egg pizza . the yolk oozes over the pizza , and you get to catch it all with your yummy pizza . hmm . . . yolk . . . the drinks are yummy too . love das spritza ! the thing is - sure roberta ' s is known for their pizza . . but really the star of the show is their buttermilk fried chicken . holy mackerel . the chicken is juicy on the inside , crispy on the outside , and the biscuit it comes with ? i want to marry that biscuit ! it ' s definitely on the greasy side ( we took the remainder to go , and by the time we got home , the bag was almost see through - soaked with grease ! ) i love fancy pizza , but it gets N stars because nothing beats a normal down-the-block new york slice ) 
the best sandwiches you can get hands down and course the price is right . you can ' t go wrong and one sandwich is enough to fill your belly if you are really can put them away , heck order N so you have a back up . it is tasty and a really quick meal on the go . no thrills but i can assure you that you will not be disappointed in the taste , flavor and value . the standard sandwich has sweet , sour , crunchy , freshness and just plain fantastic . i really haven ' t tried anything else but from just experiencing the sandwiches , you really can ' t go wrong . great to grab a copule for your friends for poker night , a game on the tube . the sandwiches just are perfect for yourself or for a group . simple yet it just hits the spot ! 
was really excited to come in as i ' ve heard great things . it was super crowed and they seemed annoyed by this . service was curt and unfriendly and i didn ' t leave feeling a sense of being welcomed . 
bonjour , i usually don ' t write comments but probably by solidarity to french business owners , i decided to share with you my experience . i am french and i had the surprise to find a bakery near my university . at first , i was a little bit disapointed by the " americanized " feeling . it does not completely look like a french bakery but i eventually started to feel like in paris when i tried the croissant . i found amazing that they could keep the exact taste as in france . the ice tea was amazing as well because of the " home made " natural taste . i appreciated that i could speak french there even if all the employees were not french speakers . i happened to go to an italian restaurant recently and i was disapointed that nobody could speak italian there ! you can also find french books in the " salon de th " . actually , the atmosphere with the fourniture , decoration and the customers is really nice and i forgot for a moment that i was in the usa . i also liked this area in west hartford that has a little feeling of european city center . i really recommend this place food is good , employees are nice , place is beautiful ! 
the best wooder ice in south philly ! ice tea flavor-yum ! 
unbelievable ramen ! this is really as good as it gets ! we decided on here over mamafuku noodle bar , and i can ' t imagine the pork belly buns tasting any better . definitely a foodie must if you are in nyc . it seemed like alot of tourists where here eating with us . 
went here for a quick bite to eat before an off off broadway play downtown . i didn ' t want the classic plate , so they were kind enough to make me a plate of what i wanted the classic green falafel , babaganoush , cabbage , and israeli salad . there were three sauces which accompanied my dish tahini , a hot sauce , and a yellow sauce . the hot sauce was the best . there ' s room to eat , but not that much . there are also seats outside , but i ' d recommend take out if you need space . service was speedy and friendly ! 
i am extremely pleased with new haven pizza , and continue to order with them . after my first experience with them , new haven pizza is my new favorite place to order from . when i called to place my order , i spoke directly to one of the owners , who was very friendly and accommodating . the pizza was delivered to my house quickly , and the delivery man was nice , wishing me a good night . not only is the pizza delicious and by far the best in the city , but it is a fair price and the staff was so friendly . 
the food and service were impeccable . it ' s definitely pricier , but i didn ' t feel like my money was wasted . usually a restaurant will miss on venue , service or food but this place hit the mark on all three . 
i have to make a stop here every time i visit nyc ! the corn is to die for ! i usually get the strip steak as an entree . . always a good choice . i ' ve also had the chicken dish with saut ed spinach , the shrimp dish and the huevos rancheros which were all pretty good too . the place is a bit tight but service is generally good . definitely recommend coming here even just to try the corn ! 
awesome experience all around . we were lucky to get a reservation on a thursday night to celebrate my girlfriend ' s birthday . you know you are in a danny meyer restaurant when everyone seems to actually care about your experience- from the host hostess to the waiters . the design and layout of this space is truly beautiful- it genuinely feels like a trattoria in italy . huge fan of the open bread and salumi stations , which you have to walk through to get to the main dining area . we chose to sample to mortadella , imported from italy , to start the meal . excellent stuff , much much better than the mortadella you generally find at most places ( which comes from canada usually ) . have to point out that the bread basket was very good , especially the homemade grissini , which were probably the best i ' ve ever had . we then moved on to a couple of pastas . i had the malfatti with the suckling pig and arugula . really nice dish- the pasta was fresh , the arugula added a nice contrast and the suckling pig was out of this world tender and flavorful . she had the spaghetti alle vongole and it was hands down the best pasta clams i have ever tasted . in fact , it was probably the star of the show for this meal . not sure what the hell they do to make this taste so good ( probably copious amounts of butter don ' t hurt ) but damn it was amazing . we then shared the bistecca di bue and it was a pretty decent steak . it was a little fattier than i like but flavorful and cooked perfectly . i didn ' t particularly like the beans and escarole that the steak was placed on- they had a strange flavor . we ended with the torta di nonna- very nice and light dessert , lots of lemon flavor in the cake . bill came out to N or so with N quartinos of wine- what a great deal for a wonderful meal , atmosphere and service . 
great food in a little storefront . had ahmet ( the owner ) cater some meetings and my guests loved it . home made baba ganoush and great lamb kabobs ( i prefer them medium rare ) . occasionally you can get turkish mousaka where the eggplant is so soft you can drink it with a straw ! 
standard airport food , set inside a large and actually rather decent food court . pastrami isn ' t bad at all-- wouldn ' t past muster at a deli outside of an airport , but decidedly better than the usual fast food crap , and surprisingly edible . service was a bit slow , but nothing at all like one of their competitors a few places down that had the world ' s most ridiculously line considering the odd slow hour . ordinarily this would be a N star place at best , but given the outside conditions , i can swing it N stars . 
the best crab and pork meat dumplings in the world . i love how crazy the place is , the staff will have you in and out at record time . doesn ' t seem to have been redecorated since it opened but that adds to the crazy charm of the place . 
on one hand i still enjoy coming to this diner , the food is pretty solid ( i like the omelets , bagels and lox and grilled chicken sandwiches ) but last night i felt like instead of the soup nazi , i met with the toast nazi . i ordered an omelet with dry white toast and the toast arrived burned . the waitress explained that they are under strict orders not to adjust the toaster oven or they will be fired . therefore all toast that is being served at this time will be burned . am i missing something , does that make any sense ? the waitress went back and managed to provide N ( not two ) slice of decent toast , i didn ' t dare ask about the missing replacement piece . also my omelet was incorrect and had to be sent back and came back very oily . i feel that i am getting the message that strange management practices are starting to rule the place and the customer does not come first . i can tell the waitress was trying her best but didn ' t want to get into trouble . i will try this place one or two more times before starting to try other diners . 
amazingly nice place , delicious food , huge quantities , cheap , super service . the weekend brunch is simply sensationnal ! i had a egg steak and my friend norvegian benedict eggs with smoked salmon ! perfect ! less than N bucks per person ! ! ! 
very good place to get great tasting salads , creeps , and panini ' s . amazing . so happy this place is the neighborhood . 
internet cuts in and out so it is impossible to be productive there . they said they were fixing it weeks ago , but still having the same problem . coffee is good . sandwiches are delicious . if they fixed the internet , has the potential to be my daily neighborhood coffee place , but i am losing hope patience . 
came here for the first time and i loved it . everything is very fresh and the staff is very nice . i had one of the many choices of savory crepes that they offer - chicken , pine nuts , tomatoes and pesto . the portion was a good size , very tasty and filling . the crepe came with a side salad of mixed greens , tomatoes , cucumbers topped with balsamic dressing and a large slice of fresh pineapple . i also ordered one of the sweet crepe with choice of N fillings for my N yr old . bananas and berries . delicious ! i would definitely recommend this place . 
nice little find in old city . we came here based on yelp reviews looking for a cocktail lounge for drinks before our late dinner reservation elsewhere . yelp did not steer us wrong . it ' s a small cozy joint . good ambience , has an old school international vibe to it . check out the coffered ceiling . we were able to score a N place high top across from the bar at N on a saturday . there are some booths in the back . the place filled up as we were there . the drink menu is interesting and different . wifey was very happy with the french snap . i had a classic margarita and a dark and stormy . both were tasty and easy drinking , but i feel like they were a little light on the liquor . maybe it ' s just me . drinks were about N each . it ' s not cheep , but pretty much expected prices for a downtown bar . another nice thing is it wasn ' t loud . i don ' t remember if there was background music at all . there was lots of bar noise from the other patrons but it was pleasant and not overwhelming like other places where you have to shout to hear the people you are with . wifey and i were able to have a nice conversation . one thing we were confused about is if you were supposed to go up to the bar if sitting at the table . we entered , sat down , waited a bit . we were discussing if i should just go up to the bar when the bartender came over to get our order . then the place got busy and we didn ' t get any attention until a second bartender came on and checked on us . when we were ready to leave we has to flag down the bartender for the check . maybe i ' m getting too used to table service . i dunno . 
geno ' s is even worse than pat ' s , and i think they ' re both pretty crappy . but , geno ' s slices their steak all weird and it ' s just not right . the only reason to come down here is late at night if you ' re looking for a good side show . but , once you ' ve seen it once , there ' s no reason to go back . especially not for the cheesesteaks . 
this comfortable , hidden , intimate west village locale , set in an old decommissioned Nth century industrial refractory brick chimenea , is a great place to either meet friends after work or get cozy with a date . always a good time here . 
good burgers , not great but very good . . . . . great spot to grab american fare late at night . . . . . not the cleanest but the service is fair and the food is good ! ! 
i was super excited when i learned zaiya had branched out further in midtown east ( because i was a frequent to the Nst street location ) . selections are more limited here across the board - no green tea lattes and minimal cakes . the rice bowls and onigiri are still quite yummy nonetheless . i love the spicy tuna and regular tuna onigiri . the buns also make great snacks . only three stars , because i know the other location offers more ! 
i had to go here because of yelp and it is worthy of a trip . the store is very small and only has N table and a few stools lining a wall with a narrow counter . i tried N crepes the omelet ( egg , ham , onions , mushroom and swiss ) , margarita ( mozzarella , tomato and basil ) and sweet berries ( strawberry and sugar ) . all were tasty and i would try them again . the chef let some of the swiss cheese melt onto the crepe pan to melt out the oil and leave a crunchy cheese residue for the omelet different and a nice touch but not my favorite thing . i associate crepes with being sweet but the savory crepes were good . they use fresh ingredients like basil , mushrooms and strawberries which made all the difference in the world . talking to the chef she said that the N most asked for crepes are the nutella banana ( very sweet ) and the omelet . she also said that the crepes will taste better eaten fresh instead of taking them home , the crepe will get soggy . the take out containers for the crepes are paper triangle shaped single slice pizza boxes . the chef uses N different crepe batters a darker one for the savory and a lighter airy one for the sweet . next time i go i will try something else . 
i went to dinner here at N on a saturday night , and it did not meet my expectations . the waiters could have been snails they were so slow , it completely ruined our dining experience . the food was mediocre at the atmosphere was lively , but i don ' t think it was worth the money . 
awesome awesome the best in nyc ! ! ! 
liked the ambiance of this place as well as the beer selection . the hostess who sat us and the bartender who served us were very courteous , but the waitress who took care of us for the evening made us feel unnecessarily rushed . appetizer we got the seasonal flatbread . a little squishy , but flavorful entree i got the mushroom dip , i do love me some mushrooms and brioche , but by the end i found myself getting quite full and unabashedly picking out the mushrooms and eating them with my fork . no fault of the sandwich by any means , it was quite tasty . fries and salad that came as sides were okay . 
i felt pretty smug when the hostess led us to our table immediately after we stepped in . but then i remembered that it was a wednesday morning . nonetheless , the spotted pig was still a fantastic experience . i . deviled eggs i admit , i don ' t think i ' ve had deviled eggs often in my life . . . if at all . the closest contact i ' ve come with them is when i watched ariane make deviled eggs on top chef ( " how do you expect to win with deviled eggs ? ! " says tom colicchio ) . . . but i digress . the eggs were delicious . . . . mustardy and vinegary . just the way i guess i should like deviled eggs . ii . chargrilled burger w " shoestrings " we shared this bad boy . burger was all i ever hoped it would be - and it ' s not totally unwieldy like most burgers that i ' ve eaten in restaurants . the best part , of course , are the shoestrings . no freaky soggy fries in the mess that they put on your plate . and they have garlic chips in them , too , if you dig around enough . they ' re kind of awkward to eat though . . . i ended up clawing at them and picking them up N at a time . what ' s a girl to do ? iii . chicken liver toast best part of the meal ! doesn ' t look all too appetizing . i can only describe it as aesthetically pleasing as mud on bread . but it ' s so delicious . you ' ll probably feel like you ' d be okay with eating this for the rest of your life . and you ' ll probably dream about it later that night . that ' s how good it is . 
now , i ' m no ramen expert . but i bet you aren ' t either . i bet you just like good food and you ' re looking for a nice meal in a nice restaurant with nice servers and nice atmosphere . chuko fits the bill on all counts . my only previous experience with ramen was through a different restaurant on vanderbilt which shall remain nameless--a more casual spot that shuttered rather quickly after its opening due to the mediocrity of its food . based on that experience of overly salty strange-tasting brothy vegetables , i couldn ' t quite imagine what all the hubbub over ramen was about . chuko convinced me halfway through our appetizers that it could deliver seriously delicious food in unexpected combinations . the spicy pickle special wowed me , as did the surprisingly complex and savory kale salad . my dining companions were bowled over by the brussel sprout dish , of which i only had a small though tasty bite . then came the ramen . i opted for the vegetable broth with market veggies and soft-poached egg . two sips in and i totally understood the hype of ramen . the broth was utterly satisfying and flavorful without at all being overly salty . the egg gave a lovely richness , and the veggies which included some kind of green sprouts , winter squash , and what appeared to be roasted parsnips provided texture and a pleasant subtle sweetness . i may know nothing about ramen , but i do know that i finished every last morsel of food placed in front of me . two hours later i was craving for more and when i woke up this morning my first thought was about how much i enjoyed dinner last night . i can not wait to go back to chuko . and i can not wait to see what kinds of wine and beer they serve after they get their liquor license . 
having heard great things about this place i was very excited to try it out . however everytime i have gone there the hostess seems to take pleasure in informing me of a N hour wait . i understand if there is a wait however a bit of empathy goes a long way . the food is excellent and the service is good . loved the bleu cheese iceberg salad and the ribeye steak . wasn ' t crazy about the truffle mash though , a little too salty . when is this fascination with truffle oil going to end , when you put truffle oil on food thats all you end up tasting . 
keeping my fingers crossed brooklyn ice house stays the way it is now forever , coolest bar in brooklyn ( for locals ) 
when you first walk in , the place looks dark and has a cold feel to it . after being seated , the waiter was very pleasant and knowledgable about the menu and recommended some of the specials on the menu and we took his advise . we were extremely happy with the flavors in the food and the amount that was served . if you do decide to visit this restaurant i highly recommend you start your meal with their own version of the hummus , you will not regret it . to end your meal with a great dessert , you really should try their bananas foster , yummy ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i moved away from brooklyn recently and i am now having biblio withdrawals symptoms . i miss this place so much . everything is amazing here . awesome and varied beer selection , great staff , laid back but classy atmosphere and phenomenal food . the brunch here is life changing . i recommend everything . like , everything . 
soba-ya introduced me to japanese food that wasn ' t sushi . go . watch the soba noodles being made . eat the soba or udon , hot or cold . try vegetables like lotus root that you never even knew existed . perhaps avoid the salted squid guts , or man it up and try them out ! decent saki choices available as well . kampai ! 
great little neighbor hood bar . burger are very good you just have to try the wings ! great selection of beer . i try a different one every time i go ! great on a sat night
very good pizza . nice place to eat if you have a late class . 
the best food at the best prices ! nothing that i can ' t recommend . i eat there all the time . . . try their subs , pizza or burgers and for the dessert cheesecake is a must ! 
it is hit or miss on freshness . it is also slightly overpriced for this sort of thing , but i love the pay-by-weight concept . it ' s good for a quick meal , but i wouldn ' t call it gourmet . 
on a sunday morning . . deciding to celebrate my friend ' s offer and also end of her internship . . Nam ( alarm rang ) friend what ' s our plan ? ? me should i just wake up . . N . Nam decided to wake up and take a quick shower N . Nam took a cab to clinton . . omg . . there is already a long line . . are you serious ? ? everyone wake up that early on a sunday morning ? ? ? N . Nam . . we received a wait N to N min . . decided to wait . . grab a spinach and cheddar muffin from the bakery and a free buttermilk biscuit . . buttermilk biscuit was great but i had better one . . i love the cheddar muffin . . the muffin crust was baked till the perfect texture . . N . Nam . . received a text and said that our table is ready . . d omg . . i can ' t believe we made it . . i always want to try clinton but every time i am just too hungry to wait . . ordered blueberry pancakes and the smoked salmon benedict substitute with the sourdough bread . . smoked salmon was really good . . i guess it will taste better with the potato pancake . . but overall it ' s good . . worth the wait ? ? erm . . i really don ' t know . . as for blueberry pancake . . the highlight was the maple sauce . . the pancake was pretty normal to me . . but still decent and good to enjoy . . we ordered the sweet potato fries as a side . . i am sorry but the sweet potato fries wasn ' t that great . . i don ' t really like it . . overall . . good brunch . . but i guess i still prefer jane . . 
i ' ve been to el almacen three times . its prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good , so one puts up with the wait and the uncomfortably tight seating arrangements and the cash only ( actually i think they take credit card now ) . i ' m reviewing the service . hipster waitress who can ' t describe the cervezas but then acts bitchy when someone in our party didn ' t order a drink . look i know the money is in the bar , but you just lost yourself a couple percentage points in tip . 
you know a place is great when you cant name the best thing you ate because they were all just . so . good . we debated ordering the tasting menu , but ended up going a la carte . we had bacon tater tots scallop crudo oysters burrata ribeye panna cotta i can honestly say everything was excellent . even the bathroom was clean and maintained nicely . will definitely be back soon . 
wonderful went for my birthday last week . blood orange margarita pitcher is good and better pricing than just ordering one - ) . . also got complimentary churros for my birthday . the waiter we had wasss soooo nice and super cute and explained everything clearly . i got the pasilla braised pork . . delcious . . no complaints ! ! 
the food was great , everthing was so fresh . walked in sat right down didn ' t wit more than N minutes . the frankies iced tea was great if your into bitters . the salads were so fresh , i got the fennel and the shaved brussel sprouts - both were delicious . but the main star of my dinner was the sweet potato ravioli , they were amazing . the gnocchi was also great . for desert i had the terrormisu and it was great . 
after reading the great reviews , what a disappointment . i had a soup of tasteless vegetables and water , and shrimp in " lobster sauce " which tasted like good shrimp in glop with egg whites . maybe one day i ' ll give it another try , but i won ' t be in a rush to do so . 
i wanted to love this place but to be honest , the food was so forgettable that i don ' t even remember what i had . they do have a great coupon incentive and i wouldn ' t not go there based on my review . i ' m pretty particular and seriously if i don ' t even remember what we had - that says a lot ! my boyfriend and i have traveled extensively the last N months and have eaten all up and down the eastern seaboard . the service was smooth . . . 
i was so tired at Nam . jian , one of my new friends who was staying with us at the hotel wanted to stay and dance . i didn ' t feel like joining the rest of them at hop kee , the chinese restaurant that all the filipinos in the tri-state area go to . i ' ve never been , i ' d love to try it someday , but christine and bree wanted chicken and rice , chicken and rice , they were chanting chicken and rice what the hell was this obsession with chicken and rice ? we met a new friend that night , jesse and his girlfriend and jesse told us the best chicken and rice place was on Nrd and Nth . ok first of all , i don ' t like eating meat unless it ' s organic , especially chicken , second , i don ' t eat street food , and third , i don ' t eat street food . i ' m sitting there at Nam with my new filipino peeps and i have to tell you that it was so good with that yogurt sauce and grease , and lettuce , and grease , plus grease , but it was as satisfying as indian food , with the grease . truthfully , i would never do chicken and rice again , unless i was with my peeps , it ' s more of a fun group activity . 
go to this aussie eatery for the best brunch in town ! go for the brekkie , sweet potato fries , and their excellent tea selection . great friendly service vibe . 
not a fan . food was not cooked the way we asked , and stupidly overpriced-for N people for breakfast the bill was N- five bucks for a plate of french fries ? pancakes looked good but had no flavor . giving it N stars since the sandwiches i saw other patrons eating looked good . 
N dollars for a stake , a bit pricey but wow it was worth it . the brownie desert at the end just wone me over . definately recomend . 
the food was mediocre . i agree with the other reviews which descibe the food as " bland " . our server was jose he seems completely disinterested in being a waiter at all . i was mildly disappointed , until i recieved my credit card statement - i was over-charged N . i called the resturant , spoke with a manager who didn ' t seem interested in rectifying the situation . i was told that she couldn ' t help me unless i had my reciept . i informed her that i did have my receipt gave her the date , server ' s name , their ticket the transaction code from visa . she took my told me that she ' d have to have someone get back to me . three days later , no one had returned my call nothing had been done . i called again to address the situation a man who said he was the owner told me that i would have to come back to the resturant to have the situation rectified . i informed him that i was not close to the resturant i saw no reason that he couldn ' t handle it over the phone . i gave him my visa information he said that he would take care of it . that was N days ago my visa still hasn ' t been credited . 
ok so i ' m giving galli N stars as the food is above decent and the atmosphere is really cool ( it gets pretty bumping , the crowd seems young and relatively trendy , and the location is tops . having said all that - the time i went , i had the most over-enthusiastic server in the history of dining out . when i asked for a recommendation , he proceeded to list every single item on the menu , applying superlative adjectives ( " amazing " , " fantastic " , " unbeatable " ) to them all . it was a bit of a turn off and made me second guess what i would otherwise really have enjoyed . 
i ' m new to new york . . . so i got on yelp hoping i could have some guidance to find a good restuarant to end my night . thank god for the internet because it led me to ghandi ' s . the food was spectactular ! i was originally going to go to an applebees or buffalo wild wings . and am i glad i didn ' t . just like i read in the previous reviews , when i told the server i wasn ' t familiar with the menu . . . he directed me to what was good . i had a curry dish . . . i asked to make it spicy and it was just right . the garlic bread is the truth ! will definitely be back . thanks again yelp ! 
how good can a bowl of ramen really be ? that was what ran through my mind as we stood outside the spot waiting nearly N minutes along with quite a few other people . while we waited a group of guys walked by and one of them was telling his friends that the ramen at this place was among the best he has ever had . he even asked us how long we were waiting and when we told him he said " see ! thats how good it is ! " ( jury is out on if he was drunk or not ) . when we finally got seated inside i have to say i liked the atmosphere of the place . it was kinda like a tiny lil dive spot , a little basement level hole in the wall where everyone was kinda packed in but all were in good spirits and just enjoying a good meal . the menu selection isn ' t huge but thats irrelevant because the only thing you have to care about is the ramen . . . the ramen . . . . the ramen ! i ordered the spicy totto ramen with chicken and really didn ' t know what to expect since my prior experience with ramen was the stuff you buy from vending machines that came in a styrofoam cup . let me say you are never prepared for just how good the whole things is . the noodles were cooked perfectly , the broth is unbelievably good and everything else just ties it all together so nicely . i just could not get enough , i didn ' t put my spoon down until it was all gone . if you like food ( yes i ' m going that far ) in general then you owe it to yourself to have a bowl of ramen here at least once in your life ) 
i ' ve been here a few times . i can honestly take or leave this place . like the atmosphere , can ' t say i ' m crazy about the prices or the food though . alot of hot girls hang out on the weekends . i give it an extra star just for that . 
hot wok was just alright . can ' t say i enjoyed it as much as some other reviewers , but it was pretty not bad . the service was a little too attentive- like they watched our every move and came to refill waters as soon as a sip was taken . felt a bit awkward , to be honest . i guess it ' s better than a lack of attention though . veggie mu shu appetizer was decent , though the pancake was pretty dry . i had the twice- cooked pork from their specials menu ( though i doubt this menu rotates much ) as suggested by another yelper in a previous review . it was tasty and the spice wasn ' t overpowering . the side of brown rice was disappointing- way overcooked and dry . overall not bad , but not good enough to hurry back for either . 
a coworker suggested that we try out this place for lunch the other day . when we arrived , the line was so long it was almost out the door . the wait wasn ' t too bad ( about Nmin ) and we got our food a few minutes after ordering too . i only carry credit and debit cards , but this place is cash only . a little disappointing , but it ' s how the place is . now , the service was alright . the guy who took my order seemed to look down on us because we " didn ' t know how to order our food properly . " excuse me if there ' s a certain unknown etiquette to ordering a simple philly cheesesteak . in the end , the cheesesteak was really good . not sure if it was worth all the hassle . 
one of my favorite restaurants in the city . i have dined a number of times in the dining room but i love going to the tavern area for lunch . the service is always top notch and on weekends , they offer an off the menu burger as well as a house made sandwich . both the beers on tap and the wines by the glass change frequently so there is always something new to try . they also have the best ice cream that i ever tasted . you must try a scoop of the butter pecan . 
they have the best jampong i ' ve ever had . the service was great and the musical atmosphere was very nice as well . i will definitely be returning soon
absolutely great indian food . while it is a small restaurant hidden in a small shopping center , it is definitely worth a visit . we order their chicken N appetizer every single time we go , as well as an order of their naan , which is just fantastic . the service is good , especially since it seems they do more take-out than sit down orders . the restaurant was also recently redone so the dining room looks really , really great . highly recommended ! 
love this place ! the texas cobb is my fav but the bbq and brisket sandwich are amazing ! also , the N . N chips and salsa are a no brainer . i can ' t drink margaritas but they have fantastic cocktails such as the drunken arnold palmer . i also have to shout out becky . she is the best waitress ! so polite , nice , and attentive . truly appreciate her great service ) this is the best place in nolibs . 
jimmys always has great food ! this why i come back along with its location and view . but it is pricey and i hate the auto tip ! it used to be like every other restaurant and tip as you wish . then since it gets a lot of bus crowds they probably weren ' t tipping at all . so they went to N or more and they add auto N tip ! i had my wife and i with two toddlers and a new born ! ? yeap they auto tipped themselves ! ! wtf . . . stopped going for a while after that , but when returned the auto tip worsened ! ! ! ! ! now it is N for N and N there after . and believe me some of the waitress staff deserve it and more , but some have less personality then the lobsters waiting to die by the counter area . and they don ' t deserve it . . . mixed feelings , i love the food but hate being told what to tip . 
if you like to wait forever for overpriced cafeteria-style spanish carribean fast food then this is the place for you . the wait time in the stuffy , hot , smelly staircase is never correct and the staff is rude at best- particularly the owner with a napolean complex and an embarressing mustache . 
great service , very classy , good food and overall a nice time . we had a lot of seafood and it was well made , with lots of explanation about the taste , alternatives , etc . 
placed was awful , waitress was rude and blunt . literally watched the bartender treat the kitchen staff with the most disrespect i have ever seen . 
cute french restaurant ! the intimate setting is good for dates or double dates , and it ' s not loud , so you can still have a conversation . the goat cheese tart was really well balanced , so even my bf , who hates cheese , enjoyed it . we also shared the curry mussels , which were tender , but a tad gritty . for entrees , i got the very decadent filet mignon with foie gras and he got some seafood pasta dish , both awesome . staff were all really friendly and the waiter offered us an extra side of vegetable purees . 
so i ' ve been eating at the cart for N years . i ' m gonna give it to yall plain and simple . N bucks for chicken or lamb or both with rice . when people think of " the halal cart on Nrd and Nth " they think of the specific cart next to the fountain . that specific cart is only there after N N pm . there is a cart in this spot during the day time ( which isn ' t bad either ) but isn ' t the " famous " one you came for . however , the other cart on the opposite side of the street ( under the scaffolding ) is owned by the same people and is there from at least Npm noon every day until the early am ( i ' ve also tried both at the same time ) . a cart owned by the same people has actually expanded to the immediate area ( i want to say around Nst street and N Nth ) . one way to tell if you ' re getting the right platter is by the umbrellas- these guys use umbrellas that say " halalguys . com " on them . another way is by the yellow bags the food comes in that also say " halal guys " or " we are different . " eating it use lots of white sauce and very little hot sauce . if you eat it to " stay " you can always ask for a cover ( if they don ' t give you one ) and a bag if you decide to take it home . also just fyi there is no public bathroom ( that i know of ) in the immediate area ) . and when it ' s cold out sometimes i ' ll go into the apple bank and just sit in there and eat it . lastly , the line can get long but it goes by quickly . happy eating ! 
very solid burgers . nice size , good toppings and the bun is very interesting . more substantial than a typical burger bun , so it can really hold up to multiple toppings without falling apart . the fries are good , but nothing amazing ( we tried the regular , seasoned and chili cheese fries ) . i ' m a fan of five guys , particularly the free peanuts and the fries . i like the burgers too , but i think N burgers burger may be better . very reasonable and we had a groupon which made it a real steal . if you like the smashed burger style , you should love this place ( i thought it was way better than smashburger not nearly as salty and just tastier all around ) . 
i love zavinos and i can ' t even eat pizza . every time i go , i stare longingly at the pizzas my friends order , they all look and smell so good ! however , they also do meats and cheeses , and a small list of small plates . all delicious . throw in a great wine list and some daily specials in a small , cozy location and zavinos becomes this magical little place that feels like europe , right on the corner of Nth street . this place is perfect for hanging out with a small group of friends , going on a date and or hanging out with your parents when they are in town . seriously , i enjoy it for all occasions . nice work , kids . 
great food , service and ambience . 
poor service the hostess was not helpful at all , food was decent but portions are a bit to small even for tapas , the crowd is a little weird . good wines tho . 
have gone to danny ' s a number of times and the tomato pie is consistently prepared . crust is crispy , chunks of tomato and light cheese . do yourself a favor and give danny ' s a try , you won ' t be disappointed . ranks right up there with the best tomato pies in the trenton area . 
my favorite restaurant hands down . always where i want to go for a good meal in glastonbury . 
over the years , this place has changed cosmetically and concept . the food here use to be really authentic . now , there ' s a different chef or cook . 
came here on a date and sat at the bar . the service was excellent , the staff being helpful without being intrusive . we shared a delicious bottles of sauv blanc and the salmon tartare which was so delicious i ' ve dreamt about it . ok not really , but i think about it every night before i go to sleep and every morning when i wake up . we also shared clams and a cheese plate , both also awesome but seriously . . . get the salmon tartare
the food was unique and delicious . the maitre d seemed to be having an off day but our waitress was helpful and friendly . we tried N appetizers - scallops in green curry , pork jowl with watermelon , and fried oysters . they were all flavorful and colorful , but the fried oysters were my favorite . we were worried the jowl would be fatty and heavy but the watermelon helped to balance it out and keep it refreshing . the drinks all had a summery asian spin which were unique as well . i look forward to going back . 
fantastic breakfast and awesome atmosphere . would recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast or lunch ! 
suuuuuuuushiiiiiiiii . yum . yum . so yum . went with a group , had a reservation , we got some apps and a couple rolls and we were in sushi city . it was so good , we got the pepper tuna , some spring rolls , and a bunch of other good ish . to each his own sushi roll . everyone ' s got their own preferences , but we each enjoyed every single bite . we also got some good saki ! this place was great ! 
this is one of my favorite places to drink in brooklyn . yeah it can be a bit of a meat market later in the night , and yeah the bouncer will lock you out ( and no he doesn ' t give a flying flip if the rest of your group is inside and you have to sit on berry talking to the other outcast that got shunned from the bar ) . these things don ' t ever detract from my experience at the levee though , i really do love this place . there are two main rooms to hang out in and two sides of the bar and also an outdoor seating area . the bathrooms , both unisex , will remind you of a litter box that has been abandoned by the cat itself years ago because it was so disgusting . get the sportsman . 
highly recommend the weekend brunch . looking forward to go back for dinner soon . 
went back a week or so ago for the boyfriend ' s birthday . the service was infinitely better this time . we were seated promptly and our waiter was very nice and helpful . still N stars though , because it didn ' t blow me out of the water , but even with the name change , the food is absolutely excellent . 
the best takeout-delivery in the area ! ! ! ! very tasty fast food and some pretty yummy home-style chicken ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! have seen many places come and go in this area and this one remains by far the best choice ! ! ! ! try the chicken sandwich----secret recipe . even the mac and cheese on fridays ! and the coffee outranks most franchised brands in taste . breakfast catered deliveries are awaited events at the office . freshly baked muffins , and quite large . waitresses are nice , except resemble old alice cast in style . rest of staff family run -working hard to get your order out quick ! ! and thats always good for me ! 
the place has a shanty feel . you ' re in red hook , it ' s great ! get the irish coffee . it will put an end to the shiver in your timbers . in fact all the cocktails here are amazing , but the irish coffee is like no other . 
great selection of toppings ranging from fried cauliflower to guacamole and very quick service despite the long line . the falafel was good , and even though it was a tony bit mushy , i think i will still be back . if you are going around the lunch hour , you may want to take it to go because seating is limited . 
okay , so the food is good . is it authentic italian ? i do not care . walk in and say hello we would like to sit in the garden . server - oh i am sorry that will be an hour wait . you - okay we will wait . yes you should wait . if you were smart you would make a reservation . the garden is sexy , the garden is intimate , the garden is great , the garden is private ! 
i want to give them a better review because the food is seriously so amazing , but i just don ' t like the clientele . am i a dick for saying that ? it ' s like the atmosphere that louis c . k . describes when he talks about trendy coffee shops . unbelievable food though , seriously ! 
pyt is kick-a nuff said ! ! ! i always stop by when in town . great burgers , chill staff , located in the piazza at schmidt ' s , located within walking distance to penn ' s landing ( nyc city walking distance ) and surrounded by other easily accessible watering holes . this trip i stopped in on the way to the roots picnic for a little downtime before the show . sat outside , opted for the burger of the month , which was the eggs benedict burger the perfect combo for my mood at the time . i also opted for a pitcher of bloody mary with the following sides bacon , olives , cucumber and lemon once again it ' s on . a great place for brunch , a change of pace when in philly , and interesting burgers , which happen to be pretty banging . 
having lunch with my hommie john -tops diner always wow me . . . been to this place several times and i don ' t i ' ve ever had a really bad visit . it ' s a popular place so one might have to wait a little bit , but it ' s well worth the wait . 
overall a good restaurant , best for the plainsboro location . i like the periodic coupons they send when you register and they offer byob - " bring your own booze " 
great service and sublime pasta ! 
first , this place should come with some directions . i read up on the place before arriving but was still confused when we stumbled past a coffee bar and ended in a market pizza shop steak place fish and veg place and bar . we arrived at N N pm on a sunday night and were a little more than confused . as they say below , though , easy to find the bathrooms ! not so easy to find anything else . at least on the first trip . contrary to the hours posted here and on the website , the place closes at N N , at least on sunday . caught one unhappy patron complaining to a cashier on our way out . went first to the birreria upstairs . i was looking for rooftop , found glassed-in dark room , mostly empty . told the waitress we just wanted drinks ( kind of need to explore the place before figuring out what to do ) , was told had to sit at the bar though the room was near empty . the seats at the bar had thousand-degree space heaters above them -- could not sit without being roasted . when we complained we got a shrug and a " i ' ve heard that before . . . . " luckily , things improved from there . the wonderful host at the fish and vegetable restaurant ( odd mix ) explained the concept - where we could grab seats , where we had to wait , etc . there was a big line at the pizza and pasta spot , so we started at the piazza , which is pretty much a stand-and-nosh kind of place . you stand around high tables , first come first serve , and order from a menu of meats , cheeses and wines . there are more items ( oysters , olives , sashimi ) and our waitress offered to compose a full meal for us , but we stuck with meats and cheeses and wine , not sure if we wanted to stand for a whole meal . next we went to manza , the meat place and sat at the bar . another glass of wine , sweetbreads and pork shoulder bolognese on papardelle later , we groaned in pleasure . two of us split everything and had no trouble doing so . it was fabulous . 
as always , hot on d spot rocks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
buffet set up food sold by weight . the selection is great and the taste quality excellent . seats are on short supply and there doesn ' t seem to be anywhere to drop your tray off after you have finished . inspite of this , definitely a place to come back to ! pork rice rolls were excellent . kimchi was so so . 
i grew up in montogomery twp but have been on the west coast for the last N years . family and i attended a family reunion recently and i begged my mother to take us to this place . the pizza sucked and tasted like it was a frozen grocery store staple . what a friggin ' disappointment it was . two pies and they both blew the monkey . we should have gone into trenton but we were hungry and this place was close . the next day i had the hershey squirts and was blowin ' out farts like a N year old beagle . i also had to suck down a quart of peptol bismol cuz i had a N alarm fire in my throat . this place sucked ! 
the burger was good , but the attitude was not . after hearing about this place for months , i finally ordered a burger here , and wish i had gone up the road to one pepper grill . the burger here was ok , but the waiting around for N minutes wasn ' t . you order at the counter , then give the cook a piece of a cigarette box with writing on it , and that ' s supposed to be your order , then over N minutes later you get an ok burger . save yourself , go up the road , enjoy the tv ' s and beer selection , while you wait the N-N minutes they need to cook a burger . 
i hate spinach and i hate artichoke so how come that combination on a slice of pizza from this place is perhaps the best tasting pizza i ' ve ever had ? so simple , so good , so creamy , so cheesy , so absolutely frickin ' delightful . i ' m sorry but there ' s just something so straightforward about this spinach artichoke pizza that just busts through your mouth and grabs your taste buds by the tongue and just slaps it around silly until you succumb to it ' s amazing flavors . meat aside , this pizza is the epitome of what i ' d previously imagine how a new york pizza would taste like and how it ought to taste like . now , that ' s a pizza pieeeeeee ! 
what a disappointment - from the website , pictures , menu , etc . , my friend and i highly anticipated eating at northern spy . we wish we hadn ' t . he ordered the pork and it was so fatty that every bite felt like it was wrapped in slime . i had the risotto and it was both bland and blah . the flatbread with carmelized shallots was ok . staff was semi-friendly . the best thing was the decor environment - truly lovely and inviting . but too bad about the food ! 
this used to be a fav hangout in the past . good food and drinks with bar pool tables upstairs . use the bathroom downstairs though . . . 
coming from california , i ' ve had my share of good mexican food . it is very difficult to find a decent burrito anywhere out here . el fuego is as close as i ' ve come in philadelphia . their burritos are huge and quite tasty . far better than santa fe burrito . 
brunch in hells kitchen is like the ol ' sayin ' " water , water everywhere not to drink " . like many of the other reviewers have stated , the area of Nth avenue has a abundance of places to eat but not all of them are good . like the N , N " yum , yum " places i see cropping up . i liked nook for it ' s neighborly feel and charm . it maybe a bit cramped inside and on weekends it can be quite a wait but if you find a table you ' ll get great service from the people who work there and some friendly conversation . the food as really great and the portions were big ! the owner , who also serves " is really great and friendly and always remembers what you drank last . the place is tiny but it adds to the charm and the friendly that you are a friend ' s house with N or N tables of your " closest " bffs instead of on a busy avenue . 
i ordered the wrong dish by accident and the restaurant let me change it , which was nice . they forgot the egg in my order so i ' m deducting a star for that . broth and udon were delicious ! 
sen ' s was a truly big disappointment for us and we do not recommend this place if you are looking for a hearty meal . i do not feel happy about patronizing a restaurant where i have to keep reminding the waiters to fill their empty buffet trays when they know it is very well empty . we enjoyed the last time but not today and we have decided no more since there are other chinese restaurants like fuji that still make good chinese food and treat the customers well . we walked in after N pm thinking that we were just on time for lunch but what we found for the buffet was nothing more than scraps and barely enough to serve the people around . the manager owner kept moving around the buffet area using her ladle to push the food around and we thought she was going to make sure the buffet trays were filled but she did nothing at all and after a while , slithered away to the cash register area pretending not to know . finally , knowing they were not going to do anything about treating the customers right , we had to tell them to fill up the buffet trays which they did so but only for dishes that we asked for . the rest of the trays were simply left empty . to add injury to insult , they billed my child of N years for a full price when they knew very well she was to be billed at the child rate . all this after leaving empty buffet trays to serve us from the pot stickers , to the kway teow , to the sweet sour chicken , char siew ( bbq spare ribs ) , general tso ' s chicken , flounder and the prawn and vege dish . this is a restaurant that only highlights very few buffet trays for lunch and if you are seeing empty trays for all the dishes cited above , something is really wrong about the way they treat customers . no more . 
okay , i am as crunchy as the next vermonter and certainly enjoy a good caf sandwich , but the boho caf is just gross ! i stopped in with my mother on our way back to burlington from massachusetts after reading several positive reviews . i cannot imagine how this place would get any glowing reviews ! the homemade potato chips that others raved about in their reviews were extremely stale and not at all tasty . i ordered the " tree hugger " which is the only vegetarian option . it was a measly little wrap that took over N mins to assemble . i also ordered coffee , and trust me , i like my coffee strong , but this was lukewarm sludge . my mother ordered the " tin man " which was also tiny and cold after a long wait . the worst part about this experience , however , was that the young man assembling our sandwiches with his bare hands kept pausing to take every coin and bill out of the cash register and handle it before returning to touching the sandwich ingredients--yuck ! also , the vegetables were clearly not fresh . i certainly won ' t be returning here , and if you like cleanliness and an edible meal , i recommend you skip this place ! 
i ' ve always thought of this as a great place however , they changed their bar menu and it is not as good or as satisfying as what they had before . their hummus was sub par and the selection does not due for someone with an appetite . i got there after lunch and before dinner so the bar menu was all that was available which used to be okay but no longer is . i had the salmon sliders but they were just okay , nothing to write home about . our waitress was great though . if i go back , i would not go in their in between hours if i am hungry . i debated between N and N stars but i figure their lunch and dinner menus are probably still really good . 
another great dining experience in philadelphia ! ! ! great food , great service ! we love mediterranean food and this was a winner . it ' s a bit pricey so it ' s probably a better choice for a special occasion but it ' s worth it ! 
really small place , feels like a locals spot for lunch breakers . the ordering process is a little hectic if you don ' t know what you ' re doing . 
the perfect philly experience a pats steak paired with geno ' s cheese fries
exactly what i seek for in a good neighborhood restaurant , with an interesting menu and comfortable atmosphere . the kind of place you go to every week . waited at bar for friends to arrive and thought it would be nice to eat at the bar if ever solo . staff was perfect - knowledgeable and attentive , not too intrusive and not too casual . menu has something for everybody - hard to choose between entrees but stuck with the calves liver which was perfectly cooked . will be back again . 
i ' ve been going to east west for years . i highly recommend it , not only for meals but for catering too . the beauty is in the details . they use fresh produce they they grow or they buy from local farms . they are innovative and do specials within the seasons . the food is well presented and tastes so fresh . the decor of the dinner is cozy and feels authentic . i highly recommend this restaurant ! 
been meaning to write this up for a while , but definitely worth looking into . went not too long ago for a night out and had a craving for peruvian food and it hit the spot ! we had a awesome waiter , gio ( hope i spelled it right ) and he took great care of us . can honestly say , i didn ' t go hungry , and the glass was always filled . he was very knowledgeable and recommendations were on point . food price was fair for the portions we received , you guys just need a liquor license ! ! however , everything was awesome , would go back and request him again . 
my doppelganger was born on christmas day . as you might imagine , most folks are too busy with their holiday to properly celebrate her birthday . which is why , this year , my favorite washingtonian and i took her to bouley for a proper commemoration . the heady scent of apples greeted us as we stepped inside . the small bar near the entrance was overwhelmed with patrons waiting for tables to be turned over . had i been one of the folks assigned to coat check duty i ' d have surely lost it , or fainted and fallen to my death on top of an umbrella . not the bouley coat clerks , though . amazingly , they kept their calm . even after my doppelganger panicked and had to get them go back in the coat room and fetch her i-phone . once seated , the fun began . my doppelganger and my favorite washingtonian ordered the wine pairings . i vowed to sip from their glasses . i absolutely loved the phyllo crusted florida shrimp , cape cod baby squid , scuba dived sea scallop and sweet maryland crabmeat , ocean herbal broth and the highlight of my night was the texas pink grapefruit soup infused with green cardamon , star anise and tahitian vanilla with campari sugar and fromage blanc sorbet if you ' re looking for a splurge , special occasion , let ' s do it up right kind of experience , bouley is it . service is impeccable and doesn ' t end when you leave the table . when my doppelganger asked for the wine pairings , the sommelier took her email address and promised to send them . guess what showed up in her in-box the next morning ? bouley was a true culinary adventure , the most fun my doppelganger and i have had since the time thomas keller invited us into his kitchen at the french laundry . 
i ' m thrilled to live just a few doors down from paulie gee ' s . everything was spot-on a few nights ago . it was , by far , the best neapolitan pizza i ' ve ever had . paulie gee himself came by and explained the origin of the special pizza we ordered--very personal and a lovely , welcoming gesture . the arugula salad was also quite tasty and the van leeuwen ice cream was a perfect finale to the meal . i ' m eagerly awaiting the arrival of wine to pair with the food . all in all , a wonderful culinary experience in a cozy neighborhood space . 
tourist trap for out of towners the roast pork sandwich is over rated , a bit dry , flavorless , and expensive . just because it ' s been on the food network doesn ' t mean it ' s good ! if you want a good sandwich , go to paesano ' s or john ' s roast pork . 
got the calamari tohd appetizer and was very pleasantly surprised . not only was the calamari really good , but the portion was well worth the money . for the entree , i got the yumh woon sen , which had vermicelli glass noodles and seafood , etc . i ' ve never had anything of that sort before , but i liked it . my only real objection was that i felt the dish had too many other items in it which made the noodle everything else ratio rather unsatisfying . the overall taste was good though and i quite enjoyed the spiciness . service was decent , expected and nothing out of the ordinary . the ambiance was rather nice although the lighting was a little too dim for my liking . overall , service and ambiance average N . N stars and food averages N stars . 
wont ever take another step into this place ever again . over expensive menu for very little . you will be leaving hungry . i went through the weirdest interview with an arrogant gm and once i stepped into this place i knew he would never hire me a native american this place is not diversified . from reading the horrible reviews i would say you mr . gm dont know food , wine and what your patrons want ! 
hmm tapas ! the interior is so cute and such an intimate ambiance . for drinks we got the matador ( ginger , bourbon , and an elderflower cordial i believe ) . the candied ginger in the drink just brings it all together with a hint of sweetness . we ordered patatas bravas ( spicy potatoss ) , lechon flatbread ( braised pork shoulder , broccolini , pickled guindillas , fig mustard ) , and lobster paella ( lobster , assortment of seafood such as clams , scallops and squid all tossed in squid ink ) . the spicy potatoes are great but the main point of dinner with the flatbread and paella . fig mustard , oh my goodness . i ' ve never had anything like it . mixed with the braised pork shoulder it is just a mouthful of salty and sweetness from the figs mixed all in one . the lobster paella was weird since i ' ve never had anything tossed in squid ink before . i ate it anyway and it was wonderful . heaven in your mouth although my lips did turn black after eating . tons of leftovers too because the paella can feed almost three people ! 
the previous N reviews already cover everything i could say about this awesome place . i would not rank di fara as high as frank pepe ' s in new haven , however this is the superlative best i ' ve had in new york city by far ! be prepared to wait though , even on a weekday during the daytime . also , be prepared to take it home , to a park , or ( in my case ) coney island because seating is minimal . enjoy it whlie it lasts folks ! 
i swear there is something in that white sauce . keeps me coming back for more ! just came back from ny and am craving the chicken and rice plate already ! why don ' t they have stuff like this in california ? ? ate this twice when i was in ny and am regretting not buying some and bringing it back with me lol . portions are pretty big . i bought a whole thing for myself because i was starvin like marvin and could only get through half . beware of the hot sauce . it is spicy ! ! i didn ' t know and ate a big gulp of it . my mouth was burning for a good N minutes . but ah , i want some more . gimme , gimme , gimme . . . . 
what a fabulous restaurant ! not a huge menu , but every single thing on it is worth trying . been coming here about N years now , and have never had a single complaint . staff is attentive and courteous , food is out of this world . prices are very affordable . it ' s also a byob . . . big plus ! ! 
although i love the soup , i have to say that their business practices have turned me off for good . the server charged me twice ( once before tip , once after ) and i contacted them immediately for a refund of the pre-tip amount . the manager said it happens ( as i ' m sure it does everywhere ) , and they would have the bank revert the charge . two weeks later , i followed up because nothing had happened . several days later , the manager returned my call , acting very condescending and said they " don ' t give away free food . " i offered to bring my statement , but the manager said i needed to have the bank provide a slip with an invoice for both , which of course does not exist because they don ' t issue invoices for sales , they just process sales . not worth the trouble of N lunch buffet , but left a terrible taste in my mouth . 
this is definitely the best chinese food in the area ! before moving here i didn ' t think it was that hard to get chinese right but all the other places in the area are horrible . fast and average prices . don ' t let the look of the place turn you off ! 
what a great experience . me and my wife had not only a great meal but experienced the best service . the fois gras pure was my favorite . 
simply a gem . ( please add more vegetarian delights , especially antipasto ! ) 
this place is really cute . i went to spain N years ago and have been missing their tapas . this restaurant was really great and reminded me of the tapas there ! the sandwiches are very small , about the size of an iphone priced from N to N . N . i ate sandwiches with salami , salmon , and chorizo . i definitely recommend anything with salami and chorizo . the salami tastes like regular salami , not bad but not impressive . no matter what dish you order , you get free french fries , which were just ok . i drank white sangria , which had a weak alcoholic taste to it and lots of sprite . i don ' t like strong alcohol in general , so this suited me well . they didn ' t card me , which was a little disappointing because i recently turned N and wanted the chance to show my id haha . my only complaint about the food is that the bread is kinda hard and made the roof of my mouth hurt , like when you eat too much chips or apple jacks cereal . i only ate N sandwiches it started hurting during the second sandwich . tip find a table before you order because the place is small and you don ' t want to be without a table when your food is ready . alternatively , you can order take out . overall , the experience was exciting and the portions are wonderfully small , so there ' s no pressure to overeat . i would definitely come here again and try their other N sandwiches ! 
this is the best artichoke pizza ever ! we were visiting from ca and it was suggested we go there . the place was small and everyone was sitting outside eating there pizza out of the box . we got N slices in N boxes . the slices where huge and we enjoyed every bite . i would recommend this place to anyone and when i return i will be back ! 
a little expensive ( although , look at the location ) but generally very very good . came with a coworker and had a really good meal . i started with the lamb tartare - lamb mixed with fresh mint , lemon juice , and olives , served with more olives and plain greek yogurt , all with grilled pita bread . so good . the pita were even a cut above the norm ( but obviously not naf naf caliber ) . the lamb was flavorful and the fresh mint really set things off . i could have eaten a lot of this . next for me was the octopus . good , firm but not too chewy , with nice grilled flavor and served with some thinly sliced chorizo and nice soft cooked white beans . an excellent combination . specifically , the beans were great with the octopus . and my entree was the hanger steak with oxtail reduction - an incredibly rich , flavorful sauce , all on top of pureed potatoes . the steak was medium rare , and though it wasn ' t melt in your mouth tender , this cut isn ' t going to be like that . really good . they also had stuff on the menu like the " cavair pie " which sounded incredibly decadent , and some other really good looking seafood items . too bad we couldn ' t try more . service was attentive without being snooty - they were apologetic about a police car outside doing it ' s darndest to give everyone in the restaurant epilepsy - it was annoying , but not their fault . i doubt i ' ll be back in the area again , but this is worth a visit if you ' re looking for something upscale . 
i just got off the phone with a surprisingly rude delivery rep . i have celiac disease , which means i can ' t eat gluten and i just found out that a couple of mexican restaurants in the area have corn tortillas that contain gluten ( which is news to me ) , so i called to ask if guerro ' s tortillas were or were not gluten free . the first person i spoke to was male and was extremely unhelpful . i asked him if the tortillas were gluten-free and he told me he assumed so . i asked if he could make sure . he left and came back on the lines shortly and told me they were gluten-free . i asked if he was sure . he said i had asked him to find out and he had asked someone and he didn ' t know what else there was that he could do . i said it is as simple as reading the package . he said oh , okay , in a sarcastic tone of voice , put me on hold , and a few minutes later a woman came on the line who told me the tortillas were gluten free . she was quite pleasant about this , until i asked her if she was sure and she also got defensive , saying that there was nothing on the ingredients list about flour so unless the ingredients list was wrong there should be no problem with the tortillas . i apologized for my overly-cautiousness but explained that it ' s a very serious allergy and i just wanted to make sure . i then proceeded to ask if i could place an order for delivery and in the middle of this sentence she hung up on me . i work at a restaurant that takes customer reviews and satisfaction extremely seriously , and i am really frustrated at the treatment that i just received . i understand it ' s saturday night and it ' s busy , but representatives of restaurants need to be capable of dealing professionally with all customers , including those who have food allergies that are out of their control . i was going to place an order at the restaurant , but the last thing i want to do now is call these people back and jump through hoops to make sure the food i buy won ' t make me sick . 
i have been here for brunch and for late night drinks and food . both times had nice service and the food has always been better than i had expected . i would recommend this place to just about anyone . 
very welcoming restaurant , the food was great as well ! it was so sweet of them to offer a cookie or a shot ( na pasashok ! ) before we left . we had potatoes with mushrooms for starters and ordered golubcy ( stuffed cabage ) and beef stroganoff ( it came in a pot with a pastry over it ) . we were full after the potatoes ! everything was delicious , we will go back ! 
best halal ever . ever ! ! ! the lamb is something out of this world . don ' t go to imposters as you will not understand why i mislead you . there is a list of places on the side of the carts that are theirs . so delicious . ordered lamb gyro or lamb chicken rice plate - both of these dishes are wow just depends how much you want to eat and how you want to eat it . gyro is naturally a better portable option while the plate is more of a sit down and possibly share dish . the hot sauce is really good but beware if you ' re not a seasoned vet when it comes to spice . the tzatziki sauce is what i believe takes the dishes over the top . flavor upon flavor upon flavor is what you get ! if you ' re in manhattan and you don ' t go here you ' ve made a bad culinary decision . 
we have been visiting sherry for over N years now . we were one of het first clients when she was in bloomfield and have been regulars since then . her food is excellent and service is even better . she has always made us feel at home . i would recommend this place to anyone looking for good thai food . 
amazing subs , i usually go with a hot roast beef w mozarella and gravy . my only complaint is that there is no dedicated pickup line at the register . if you order ahead and go in when it is very busy to pick up subs you still have to wait for everyone to order and pay before you can even say you are picking up an order . 
i booked a reservation to this location for a business dinner with some colleagues . i chose it based on its proximity to the fairfield on Nth road . and , of course , based on the yelp reviews . the reviews were not wrong . it ' s a smaller location , very intimate - only one waiter was on duty , but he was able to be very attentive . we started with the baked octopus and the sausage and yucca fries . the octopus was great , but man , the yucca fries were amazing . i found myself hoarding the plate , trying to block it from everyone else ' s view . for the main course , we had many different plates salmon , carne guisada , shrimp , chicken . we shared a bit and they were all delicious . i had the guisada on the waiter ' s recommendation and was glad that i did . it ' s more of a stew here than the guisada i ' m used to at mexican locations , but i had no problem with that . for desert i had the creme brulee and almost embarrased myself by strongly , strongly considering a second course of desert . highly recommended , i ' ll definitely be going back next time i ' m in the area . everyone in our group was pleasantly surprised . 
the space is nice i liked that it was calm and pretty empty . the food was good and prices well and portions were great able to share with my toddler easily . nice lady behind the counter . pretty good experience . 
i ' ve been to smokin ' betty ' s a few times and can safely say that i ' m a fan of this place . they have a great list of beers , and flights ( any four Noz beers you choose ) are only N ! that is a total bargain , and a great way to try some new brews . all the food i ' ve had here has been very good . they usually have some great stuff on their specials list , so check it out . the waitstaff is generally friendly and helpful , but not N reliable . they lose a star for an incident on my first visit . my friend had her birthday party here ( called ahead , arranged for a large group , etc ) . however , betty ' s decided to call it quits at Nam despite typical closing time being Nam . i guess our party wasn ' t enough for them to justify keeping the otherwise lightly patroned bar open . still , we felt a little jilted when the " get out " lights went on an hour ahead of schedule . oh also , it ' s never packed . i ' ve never had to wait for a table ( and i ' ve shown up with a party of N on a saturday night without reservations ) . 
i work in the area so whenever i feel like splurging a bit , i come here with coworkers or my boyfriend to grab the lunch special deal . there are three options the burger , the chicken wrap or the chicken arugula salad . im a huge fan of arugula salad so everything on the lunch special menu is delicious . i ' ve tried all three . the burger and the wrap come with fries and they all come with a drink ( soda , coffe , tea ) . you could get beer for an additional N . whenever i come here , whoever i ' m with- coworkers or boyfriend , they love love love the truffle fries . they all think its worth the extra money to opt for these instead of the regular fries . i ' m probably the only one that cares more about the actual food than the fries , but it is a must try . the burger is delicious , always . the chicken wrap is nice and juicy as well as zesty and the arugula salad makes for a great light lunch . and all of these are for N for the lunch special . definitely worth coming here for lunch if nearby , i have yet to come back to this place at night for the night time bar scene
i recently ate at olea again and continue to be delighted by the food and the staff at this excellent mediterranean restaurant . the assortment of delicious sauces dips for their pitas , including standards like hummus tzatziki , or their beet or romescu are a fantastic start to a meal . you can easily satisfy yourself with their tapas appetizers without even venturing into the main dishes . on this occasion i did just that enjoying artichoke croquettes , pita with sauces , fried haloumi cheese ( a personal favorite ) , a kale salad and lamb keftedes with my friend . the ambience is always pleasant and we dined for two delectable hours . olea is a neighborhood staple for me , always welcoming and reliably delicious . 
ahhhh . i had to breath before writing this review . . . . . my wife and i went against our better judgment and instead of ordering from the linden house like we do every saturday night . we ordered from the galaxy . we ordered the appetizer sampler and a napoleon panini to split . . . . . . . i waked in and was given an attitude from the guy at the counter who was playing with his phone . he looked like the manager . . . . i get home , the soup was ice cold , the chicken fingers and chicken wngs were so greasy that they look like the ones you would get fron one of those fride chicken spots in down linden , and the chicken quality waa horrible . . . with the sandwich we got woffle fries with brown gravy and mozzarella . . . the fries were so freezer burned it was unreal . . . . . now to the sandwich , which is the only edible thing that we would eat at this point . . . . after eating about half of the first half , my wife finds two hairs on the sandwich . . . . i could not believe that i just threw N in the trash . . . the food was so poor that i wouldnt feex it to my dog . . . my wife said lets call them and i said why ? i dont want them to replace the food or my money back . take it as a N learning experience . . . even if we did call , that jerk manager wouldnt have cared at all . he would have probaly hung up on me because so maney people call and complain im sure , they deffinently wouldnt give us the miney back and if we did get the food replaced . . . there is no doubt in my mind they would spit in it at the minimum . . . . if i could had given them negitave stars i would have . avoid this place . seriously , its a complete waste of money . and they dont even give a crap on how bad it is . please take my advice . . . 
there are thousands of good reviews of this place , this one start wouldn ' t even leave a dent in their reputation , but here goes . food ordered some shrimp special appetizer . all i could think about when i ate it was how salty this damn shrimp was . ramen was okay . i had much better elsewhere . service server was an idiot . just the worst service ever . gives customer bitchy attitude like he is someone important . maybe they have a lot of tourist customers and he is used to treating people like crap , but no matter how good the food is i and none of my friends will never dine here again . in this case , the food wasn ' t even good so no brainer . i do not recommend this place to anyone . i had better food at restaurants that do no specialize in ramen . 
seriously people , if you think its stupid to order the toast then just don ' t order the toast . i personally prefer the cucumber hummus yogurt if you ' re looking for something to start with . good , if unspectacular , food . great decor , better people watching . in N years of coming here the experience is remarkably consistent . one of my go-to spots . 
everything i ' ve ever eaten here is delicious . even my father , who is the pickiest eater i know , loves it here . i ' ve had the chicharon de pollo , carlitto ' s way chicken , suckling pig , paella . . . it ' s all amazing . the ambiance is great too . 
nice place to grab a quick pork sandwich . the fried banana was tasty as well . the last time i came here i ordered a chicken sandwich instead of pork , and it came out really pink . i asked the ladies at the cash register if it was raw and they said , " no , it is the sauce that makes it look like that . " i was skeptical because it definitely didn ' t look like it had sauce on it , but didn ' t want to be rude , so i ate it anyway - big mistake . good quick , cheap , tasty bad you might pay for it later
love the food . service is a little slow , but very friendly . i love the all you can eat but they often times forget to bring things you order , and if some people order off the menu while others have all you can eat it makes it difficult to eat at the same time . 
sakagura is a favourite for midtown japanese food foodies . its not expensive at lunch , good value and authentic . i usually take the cooked food rather than the raw , and a favourite is the seaweed salad , the tempura and the eel rice . the daily specials come with soba noodles hot or cold . i went with two guest fro a broad and they enjoyed the food but we were ushered out bruskly because we took too long to eat . its a fast in and out place so avloid it unless its a fast lunch . 
just moving here from austin where i frequented to franklins and mueller , i have high bbd standards . this place was good though i think my favorite thing was the mac and cheese . i got ribs and sausage . and overall it was good , though the vibe of the place felt a little out of place , it was a bit corporate feeling and the service was a little shaky . i think they are still working out kinks with staff . i will go back but i wasn ' t blown away
yum ! this place gets N stars for unbelievable greek food for a reasonable price ! i never go to the uws , but for kefi . . . i may just have to come back more often . dined here on a friday night , and it is jammed packed with fast turnover of tables . but kefi was nice enough to let us sit , eat , and drink for N . N hours . highlight of the night was definitely the mussels with diced tomatoes and feta cheese and flava beans , who would of thought of the outrageous combo ? sooo goood ! ! also got the mac and cheese , braised lamb shank which literally fell off the bone , and the heavenly meatballs in tomato sauce . oh , and they have N bottles of wine here , what ? ! N dishes , bottle of wine , and dessert all for N ! the service is fabulous , and a complimentary glass of red at the end does not hurt ) . i heart greek food , and this is one of the best in nyc . 
i love molly ' s ! it is what it is . . . a dark irish pub . it is best on a cool fall or winter day . there is a wood burning fireplace and sawdust on the floor . the staff is always almost friendly , but i don ' t think i would want it any other way in a place like this . the food is good with the exception of the steamed mussels , but they weren ' t bad enough for me to change my mind on the N stars . if you are looking for a cozy , irish pub . . . this is the place for you . 
remember how i said pinche taqueria ' s fish taco was second to only one other fish taco ? well i did say that , and now i ' m here to tell you about the best fish tacos and some additional seriously gourmet mexican food as well . while many places that serve tacos are a " taqueria , " i ' d consider carino much more of a gourmet mexican restaurant tequilaria . porque , they don ' t just serve tacos . they have an extensive menu , with frequent culinarily adventurous specials and amazing plated meals . the appetizers are great , particularly the guacamole and the stuffed jalapenos , and they also have gourmet cocktails , with really nice tequilas and amazing ingredients . i love the pina , which is a tequila-based drink with a chili rim . you can also get all kinds of tequila on the rocks as well , or just beer and wine . the tacos there are out of this world , and about N cents more than your average truck-price . particularly amazing are the fish taco and the azteca . the fish taco is fluffy and crispy breaded fish with amazing spicy mayo or whatever magical sauce they put in there . the azteca is a steak taco with absolutely perfect steak in it . all of the tacos that they have there are really unique , artful and creative . i feel like this restaurant would pass the grandma test , which is when you pick a grandma who ' s made the type of cuisine that is served all her life ( and perfectly ) , and if they like it , it ' s good . i feel like this place is authentic , well-executed and homey , so it would pass . grandmas know good food , no matter where in the world . . . so considering that it won ' t break the bank , and considering how tasty all of their food is , i need not try to hard to sell carino . i guess i need not even mention the happy hour , the late night happy hour , the brunch , the blog that announces all of their specials , or the fun events they ' ve done such as the negra modelo food pairing event that came with a free appetizer when you ordered a beer . by the way , my mom and her friends just loved the waiter there , the service is excellent . 
tommy dinic ' s is a sandwich lovers paradise ! ! ! somewhere in the heart of the reading terminal market is this stand that serves great italian grub ! ! ! i had a beautiful roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone ! ! ! be prepared to wait on line and catching a seat in front may prove difficult . 
i love indian food and have eaten at many indian restaurants kochi is one of the best indian restaurants i have been too . it offers a unique , savory and authentic menu . the people are very nice and accommodating as well . the prices are on par with most other establishments . the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and has ample parking in a convenient location . i recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have great food , served by nice people in a nice environment . 
they have the best boozy brunch ever and i ' ve been to my fair share of those ! everything i tried here was delicious , including the bread basket filled with mini muffins that are ridiculously fantastic ! the staff is so nice and attentive ( which is so rare when bottomless drinks are involved ) . and the sangria flavors are fun and delicious ( which is also pretty rare actually ) , i liked the red wine sangrias better but that ' s really personal opinion , and of course you can try them all ! 
i could probably end my review of bella anthony ' s right there with that one statement of a word . ( woohoo ! ! ) but . . . let ' s get some more descriptions going ! since i came with a partner in crime , we each ordered a different menu item and decided to share and conquer . everything went together perfectly . . . great start ! unlike some other connecticut restaurants , it was like having three restaurant in one . there is a romantic quite room for special dinners occasions , a tavern on the other side for drinkers ( we went there after dinner ) and a third room for family style dinners for kids young-ens . we were seated at a small table next to the windows in the more quite room where we had a great view of the outside and was very subdued and relaxing . since the portions are quite large , i was first worried whether i might not be able to finish it all , but i was very full at the end and took some home . love left-overs ! ! overall , i had great service and delicious italian food . this definitely was higher standards than i imagined and i will be visiting again for sure ! ! 
best ramen in the city ? maybe . the broth of the akamaru modern ramen is damn good and makes up for the small-ish portions . but it ' s def not as good as shinsengumi out in ca . i ' ll still be back though . . . 
finally came here last weekend with my family . i had never been to this location before but had been once to the one in d . c . which was a big disappointment . carmine ' s nyc made up for it in a big way ! our party of N ordered the calamari app ( seriously the most tender and delicious i ' ve ever had ) shrimp scampi , the sunday pasta sampler , spiedini alla romana , and tiramisu . there was more than enough food for everyone and even left overs . if i went back i ' d order the calamari and tiramisu for sure but try different main dishes . 
the kale salad , brussel sprouts and pork buns are the best around . service lovely , prices very affordable , and nice wooden bar is nice to sit at . love it . 
we always get here half an hour before they open . since the new york times review , the lines get ridiculous around Npm- up to an hour wait . their pizza is amazing but is not worth standing an hour or two in line . i had a mini college reunion here with two close friends from school . we squeezed into the tiny booths , elbows touching with the tourists next to us . we watch people prepare the dough , placing sauce and toppings on and throw the pizza into the wood burning oven . one man whisks out the pie and tosses it onto the a perforated platter . a beefy man comes by with the silver platter and places it on the pizza stand next to us . the basil fragrance drifts over us , the red sauce is bubbling and the mozzarella is fresh . we all are salivating over how the slice will taste . when our pie comes , we dig in quickly . trying to savor the multiple textures of crispy crust and gooey cheese and the sweet liquid tomato sauce before the blasting air conditioner turns the cheese to rubber . pro tip go on a day when its not too hot outside , so they are not blasting the ac . love this place . i like to space out my visits so each time is special . 
i had such high hopes for this place . the decor is beautiful and the menu looks inventive . but by and large , it just seems that they have not figured out how to be a restaurant yet . they just don ' t have it together with the service and getting people in and out . the food is ok , not bad . i have been there several times and have yet to have an experience where something did not go wrong . i am going to try it again in a year and hope to have N stars then . 
with not a lot of time for lunch i called put in my order and reserved a table , when i arrived by the time i settled the waiter was bringing my food . friendly atmosphere , very clean , food and service was great . great job ! ! 
the menu advertises " farm fresh eggs " . but they will only cook them scrambled . . . hmm . perhaps they are fresh from the powdered egg farm . homefries seemed to be a boiled potato that had been diced . service was quick and price was right . 
i work in the area and this is one of my favorite spots for a leisurely lunch on those not-so-busy days . i usually get one of the salads , like lemon shrimp or the roasted chicken , both of which are excellent , though sometimes if i ' m extra hungry i ' ll opt for a sandwich , like the fried fish or roasted ribeye . one day i ' m going to come back on saturday for lunch -- i hear they have a delicious burger special . 
wow . we walked in just hoping for a nice , comforting italian meal and what we got was so much more ! we sat at the bar for dinner so we didn ' t have to wait and ordered the tasting menu because we couldn ' t decide on the menu . i don ' t say this lightly - it ' s the best tasting menu i ' ve ever had . the flavors and portions are just right and everything is just perfection . don ' t jip yourself - you have to try it all ! and props to our bartender server for being so fun and entertaining . we had a great night . 
have been there twice and both times the service and food were awesome . the only problem is it can get really crowded and not exactly built for comfort . dishes that are fresh , flavorful , local ingredients for a french mediterranean driven menu . spot on execution , thoughtful , and attentive service . casual and welcoming atmosphere . 
a few girlfriends and i decided to check out this new french restaurant in the ues since two of the girls live in the neighborhood . from the moment we walked in we were greeted right away by the friendly staff . we were a bit late for our reservation , but were received with grace and waited for our table to be ready , while we each sipped on a glass of sparkling rose at one of the bar tables in front . we were sat at a nice table in the back and were waited on hand and foot ! the food was absolutely delectable ! we started with a nice bottle of the sparkling rose and then the wild mushroom soup with truffle oil as an appetizer , which is to die for . i ordered the salmon wrapped in zucchini as my entree . my girlfriends ordered the steak tartar , the pan seared chicken and the burrata salad . we were all very impressed with the presentation , quality and taste of our meals . i can ' t wait to go back to try the paleo zucchini pasta ! ! i would definitely recommend this restaurant for a fun girls night , brunch or date night ! this is a great find for the ues ! 
bought a groupon way back then when this place just open , and i kept come back ever since , if you are a fan of croissant and crepe try this place . . . you will not disappoint
love sanford ' s ! i like their greek style chicken wrap , the butternut squash ravioli , their pancakes and all the salads . my absolute favorite is the honey mustard ! ! must try . been going to sanfords for over N years . thanks guys ! 
tom is an affable fellow who kindly handed out goodies to those waiting for a seat on a busy saturday morning . oatmeal cookies , french toast , turkey ham , and coffee were all complimentary . tom personally conversed with me , recommending the french toast . what sage advice ! i work in a nursing home , so it was nice to see an elderly gentlemen so active and vibrant , as tom . what a great experience ! 
great place , always packed but the wait is worth it . excellent burger . and when it s sunny eat outside . 
N . N stars . i truly do not get it and i must disagree with the overwhelming N star reviews on here . came to bouley for lunch with a few freinds some time ago , and i must say , although the service and atmosphere were solid , the food was just not impressive . in fact , i was so underwhelmed , i hardly remember much of what i had . such a shame . 
the res had best pizza in the world . i ' ve been going there for N years and it had always been a great experience . we moved to de aug N and visited nj in feb N . it was the worst pizza i have ever had . the bottom of the crust was burnt black ! ! ! when we mentioned it to the waitress ( when we could get her away from her cell phone ) she told us they had a new pizza oven . no apology for serving us garbage . we asked if the place had been sold but she insisted no . we did not see any of the family who ran the restaurant for the past Nyears . would love to know what happened to such a wonderful place . r . i . p . reservoir tavern and papa nick ! ! ! ! 
best cheesecake in times square . heck ! ! best cheesecake in new york state
we visited bistango based on the gluten free options as a person in our group has celliac . atmosphere felt upscale but casual and cozy . service was friendly and very attentive regarding gluten and soy . the menu had lots of great options , i had fish , the others ordered the gluten free pizza and a salad . everyone loved their meals ! we washed the food down with gluten free beer ! yum the gluten free desserts are amazing too ! i tried the carrot cake , red velvet cake and the chocolate cake . ( yes i left stuffed ! ) most importantly , my friend felt safe at bistango . there is no cross contamination and they take their gluten free options seriously . i will return and i do not have a gluten allergy . 
best diner in nj . . hands down ! ! nothing disappoints , but try the fajitas . . . not normally a diner go-to . . but sooooo good ! ! ! 
this restaurant is the best part of the gramercy park hotel . although the starters were excellent , i could not understand why my dining partner raved over his pasta dish . it was simple , homestyle food that did not warrant the high price . i ' m open to tasting more dishes at the restaurant , but can ' t say i ' m dying to head back . the wine selection , however , made both of us happy , as did our server , who was friendly and not overbearing . 
the absolute best felafel i ' ve ever had ! ! and since felafel is my favorite food , i am always searching for the best . . and i have lived in nyc N times while performing in the theatre , and thought that was the best . . . . it ' s not ) i work at the philadelphia shakespeare theatre on Nst sansom st . ' s and everyone told me to go . . . it ' s amazing ! so glad to have found you ! ! thanks ! ! btw . . . the service is always prompt and freindly . . . if there ' s a line it moves quickly , and you can comfortably sit inside and outside too ! 
ordered delivery to my hotel room while on a trip . quick delivery , friendly staff , and very good pizza . the regular thin crust was delicious and not too greasy , with lots of toppings . definitely recommend if you ' re ordering in the south brunswick area . 
i ' m going to make a bold statement for a city that prides itself on sunday brunches jane is by far the best brunch spot in nyc . hands down . a place with N different kinds of eggs benedict dishes is my idea of heaven . the lobster benny with rosemary fries is my go-to dish . it ' s been my best friend through good times and bad ( there ' s nothing wrong with calling an inanimate object your best friend ) . the french toast is a close second , which is almost more like a heap of yummy cake with the syrup and the powdered sugar . mmmm . if you ' re looking for a brunch place , whether it ' s a place for your usual sunday brunch or for when you have friends in town , jane is the place to take them . but do know that it ' s best to make a reservation at least a week in advance to get the ideal " brunch time " because the lines are a bit ridiculous - if you go there without a reservation , you ' re guaranteed to wait over an hour for a table . 
awesome chicken enchilladas and fish tacos . still needs liquor license . 
my favorite pizza in new york city . seriously . pizza is phenomenal . my personal favorite is the diavola , but i have tried and enjoyed them all . the service is friendly and attentive . the place is comfortable and sparkling clean - love the decor . looking forward to eating out back this summer . i only wish i lived closer ! ! 
if you are coming to visit the city and looking for a good cheesesteak . . . . this is not your spot . if you want some food after clubbing or being out all night . . . this is still really not your spot , but it does satisfy if you are drunk and hungry . a plus that some might like is that the meat is very thick . it ' s not thinly sliced like most cheesesteak places around the area . you know you are getting beef ! but it is soooo greasy ! prepare to go home with a heart attack once you are finished ! lol geno ' s is a very fast pace spot . you must know what you want upon getting to the window . there ' s really no asking questions or anything like that . it ' s pick your cheese then wit or witout . done ! ! oh , and they are pretty expensive too . i don ' t think they are really worth it ! 
with so much thai in new haven , i could not believe another place could even survive . however , jeera differentiates itself by cooking healthy , fresh , and colorful foods without the " typical thai " recipes like the rest of new haven . the owner is a really sweet woman who really relishes in the food and emphasizes a healthy and spiritual lifestyle herself . unlike other thai restaurants that sometimes feel dirty or indulgent , jeera becomes a healthy addiction to freshness . if you are a vegan or vegetarian , jeera offers some of the best options in new haven . note this is primarily a take out place . there are two bar stools , but definitely not a place to take someone out . suggestions mushroom spring rolls are so good . also , the jeera fried rice is a daily habit at this point . . . . 
horrible ! i order from here a few months ago ( would ' ve reviewed sooner but just signed up for yelp ) and was disgusted with the food and the lack of care from the delivery driver . it took over N hours for us to get our food and when it finally arrived the driver left our pizza at the restaurant . instead of apologizing he suggested we pick it up instead . when he came back a half hour later he expected an extra tip for having to return and gave me an attitude when i told him i was not going to reward his mistake . and then to top it off the pizza was ice cold . never ordering from here ever again ! 
to come here with no expectations to just enjoy a burger and a beer and it never disappoints . great burger and cheap beer
went march Nth for dinner with a friend . got there around N p . m . and although the place was busy was greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately . ate crab cake , spare rib and mussel appetizers . ( mussels melt in your mouth . ) entrees were hanger steak and mac n ' cheese , fries and brussels sprouts were the veggies . all was great and would you believe we made room for scrumptious cheese cake . i didn ' t drink because i drove but go with a thirst as bar offers various beer , red and white wine choices . when we left , at N p . m . , couples were still being seated . i ' ll definitely be back . 
best food ever ! 
bone marrow brisk burger best dam burger i ' ve had in years ! good eats happy pooping
N minute wait for a table of N ? people on top of me as i drink my N liter sangria ? table the size of my seat ? tripping over another table on the way to the bathroom ? table falling over every time some shifts their seats ? yet it was so worth it . we ordered the red wine sangria for N liter , that ' s a little on the pricier side considering i ' ve never paid more then N pitcher in any other restaurant . they only put apples for fruit yet the sweetness wine were perfectly balanced , squeezed about N glasses out of it . got both of us a little tipsy which is always a plus . next , ordered the mexican grilled corn and tostones for appetizers . tostones were hot crispy on the outside with a mayo vinegar dipping sauce . the corn is unexplainable , sweet spicy tangy all perfectly moshed together . it should be a mandatory order every time a customer sits down . i could have had the sangria and corn all night long ! for entrees , we had the grilled steak and chuleta pork chop . the grilled steak came with rice black beans , the steak is the reason why i love this place . for the first time in my life , a restaurant actually cooked my steak how i asked , rare . which i know is especially hard considering it ' s a skirt steak , but they accomplished it . the pork chop came with mushrooms and smothered in this creamy sauce which tasted amazing . i would highly recommend the pork , though it does take a bit to cook you can munch on more corn ) i would definitely come back again for the drinks that all looked amazing . they had frozen on the rocks mojitos margaritas ( N ) they all looked really good . corn alcohol is highly recommended ! 
as our cab rolled up to cafeteria , i was a bit turned off by the incredibly long line . my friends and i , visiting from nj , had heard that it was a must N hour place after a night of drinking , but we were unaware that we ' d have to wait online for almost an hour for a drunk snack . we made our way to the end of the line , but only to have two doormen escort us in almost immediately , which made us very happy . unfortunately it made a few people quite upset since they had been waiting much longer would probably wait all night from the look of things . we were sat in a cozy booth , which certainly came in handy for my intoxicated sister who was able to pass out comfortably . we ordered the mac cheese spring rolls , which were to die for . i ' m not going to lie . . i wish we would have ordered two . i also ordered a turkey burger with avocado that was unfortunately overcooked , chewy without flavor . i wasnt too happy with that , but the fries were pretty tasty . the place was packed with lots of beautiful people , some of which decided to invite themselves to take a seat at our table to chat throughout our meal there were a couple of " celebrities " eating a few tables down from ours . it was a great place to people watch socialize , but the food the service weren ' t impressive . our waiter was a bit of a drama queen and a little bitchy , who forgot a few things we requested the service was slow . our table was just about on top of the one next to ours , so throughout our meal i bumped elbows with a man sitting beside me . he was very attractive turned out to be really sweet , so it worked out okay , but it was still a little uncomfortable . overall , it was an interesting experience . would i go again ? sure , why not , but not for the food . 
the crispy watercress salad ( N , if i remember correctly ) is excellent . this is perhaps the best rendition of this dish i ' ve ever had outside of thailand , and better than some of the ones i ate in thailand too . it ' s better than it ' s been at the famed sripraphai in queens for years , or maybe ever . they also have some very good curries here . i don ' t remember which other dishes we tried , but they were good , but not excellent . i ' d give the crispy watercress salad ( it ' s called " yum pak boong klob " in thai ) five stars . the curry we tried was four stars , and the other dishes were three stars . overall , that averages out to four stars . the people running this restaurant are extremely friendly . and unlike some other thai restaurants , these people are actually thai , not other asian people pretending that they know how to make thai food . not that you have to be thai to make good thai food but it probably helps to have grown up there -- there is a strong cultural culinary tradition in thailand . some of the people at boonsong are from isaan ( northeastern thailand ) so i bet the laab larb " salads " are really good there too , and maybe som tam ( papaya salad ) if they can get good enough papaya . i hope to go back soon and try those dishes . i also like brookside thai down the street , but this place is strong new competition . i hear that both restaurants also have special secret thai dishes made for local thai people on saturday mornings afternoons , take-out only . you have to ask about these on friday nights and order ahead , apparently . i hope to do this soon . i bet those " secret " tastes might be a little wild and heavy on fish paste and shrimp paste for people who used to the " real thing , " though . mmmmm ! 
i keep giving this place chances to prove me wrong , but each time i go the service continues to be way sub-par . it ' s fun to sit outside and the people watching is fun , but if you want anything more than a couple drinks i ' d advise going elsewhere because the wait staff are slooooow to wait on you . once you finally do order , you have to wait for N minutes or more to get your first drink . getting food ? come at least an hour before you even think you ' re going to be hungry . and even then , expect to find out N minutes after you place your order that whatever you had you heart set on is not available after all . . . if it weren ' t for the outdoor seating i ' d give this one star . 
i ' ll keep it simple . if you haven ' t been here yet you are ca-razy ! this place is awesome . i would give it N stars if the service wasn ' t so hit or miss , but i love love love all the food i ' ve had here . from the pho to the vermicelli to the bangin ass rice dishes . you just can ' t go wrong with pretty much any dish here . my favorites N . vegatable spring rolls N . pho tai , nam gan N . bun bo nuong N . com suon , bi , cha chung be a fatty and get them all . it ' s just that awesome . that ish cray ! 
i guess pommes frites is the new york equivalent to a new jersey diner , in that there is usually a line out the door of drunken bar-hoppers waiting for their deep-fried fix . the sauces served are so fantastic i highly recommend either the pomegranate teriyaki or sweet mango chutney . also , if you ' re lucky enough to get a seat inside , you ' ll find that the music they play is great--a wonderful throwback to the Ns , that ' s all i ' m going to say . 
being a paleo fanatic i was so psyched for this place to open as there is nothing in the city -- to the best of my knowledge -- with paleo as a concept . and to top it off , it is right near where i live . imagine the possibilities . now , even though i have eaten there several times ( again , there are no paleo options and only in dire situations will i still eat here ! ) i am not happy with this place and wish it made major improvements . the food is way over-priced and to be honest not that great . i can cook most of the things they make and was hence expecting a lot more creativity . it is almost impossible to get out of there with a simple takeout meal for under N as apart from the chicken meal ( N ! ! ! ) the way things are proportioned is very confusing and illogical . they have so many options in a cold bar setting that they will not warm up for you , but even if they did , why can ' t they pick fewer things and have them hot and fresh ? further , they have to measure each cold item one at a time , so if you wanted a meat and two sides , they literally have to weigh each one at a time and then put it on a plate . it takes way too long for food that is a slight step up from the wholefoods salad bar . did i mention how expensive they are ? last time i was there N bought me two tiny pieces of turkey meatloaf served cold without a side dish . i was starving afterwards ! they used to have really good chicken wings that were free range and reasonably priced , but i guess that wasn ' t good enough for them and they scrapped them from the menu . finally , and this is annoying , they put these little quotes and words of wisdom on a sign outside from time to time . while i am not a nutrition expert , i do know the difference between grassfed , free range , pasture raised and all the other words of paleo wisdom . apparently , their expert doesn ' t as i have seen numerous signs with mistakes on them . 
came here last night with my boyfriend and had a great experience . if you are going to eat here make sure you make a reservation beforehand . if you dont you ' ll end up waiting N hours . when we called all the reservations were booked so we put out name down at around Nand didnt get seated till N . luckily my boyfriend lives around there we we left and came back . at first we would ' ve been quite upset for waiting that long but the service made up for it . one other thing that was a bummer was that when we ordered bok choy we got napa cabbage . it was also crazy to see people still waiting at N pm on a sunday for a table . will definitely go again but will make sure to make a reservation . 
the owner is one of the most rude and obnoxious people you will ever meet ! ! ! the food is rather bland and this place is tired . . . 
omg if you like fries and sauce then you are gonna be in absolute heaven ! these french ( or should i say pommes frites ) were unlike any fry i have tasted and the variety of sauces were impressive and delicious . i ordered a regular that was N . N ( lots of fries and easily splittable ) and got the roasted garlic , cheddar , and parmesan peppercorn mayos on the side . all three were delicious and i also sampled ( ask for samples because they are very generous ) multiple more including their newest which is the black truffle mayo ( amazing ! ) . the sauces are N extra or you can get N for N . N but it ' s so worth the extra . where else can you get such unique sauces ? they also will give you lids so you can take them home to enhance other sub-par fries ) which mayo is the best you may ask ? honestly , i think it depends what your in the mood for because they are all very unique and delicious . i will say that the three i got were very good but the other one i was close to getting was the smoked eggplant mayo which was very good . as for the fries , they were very big , thick , crunchy , hot , and were even good by themselves with just a bit of salt . not your average fry by any means . all in all , if you haven ' t experienced true belgium fries then you definitely need to hit this place up because it will change your whole french fry and sauce outlook . 
my husband and i love seafood . this is place to come for sure ! came here with friends and yes you have to come with big group of ppl here cauz hot pot is huge ! it ' s soooooooo good ! come and enjoy fresh and yummi seafood hot pot ! 
came in here yesterday with a N and an N year old ( along with the rest of the family . ) i ' m not an expert on where in soho you can roll into with kids , but lombardi ' s has to be on the shortlist . 
love . best bar in brooklyn for interesting , rare , delicious beers and chill environment . a must try ! everyone is hot . food and service are much better now that they changed their setup . 
this isn ' t haute cuisine , but it really is great food . out of our N entrees ( for N people ) my mee siam was ( i thought ) the best dish on the table , but the roti canai appetizer and the thai basil noodles were must-trys as well . this was a great meal . i ' ve tried penang before and it ' s a bit more stylish , but also a bit pricier and much louder . i was able to snag a table for N on a friday night without any problem and we were seated right away . the menu is enormous but the server took the time to make recommendations in each of the N-N categories on the menu ( really nice of him ) . i never got the sense of being rushed to order , eat , pay , or leave as some other commenters noted . one additional comment even where marked ' spicy ' the dishes didn ' t have much overall heat . if you want it hot , let your server know . 
N stars is for the cheese pizza , which i had at a work baby shower . best crust ever . it was perfectly cooked , crispy on the outside but a little chewy too . the crust was just the right thickness , not too thin or doughy and held the tasty tomato sauce and cheese perfectly . i need to go back soon and confirm that this is the best pizza i ' ve ever had ! 
the food at traif was great , however we were told to have a drink at shiksa before our table was ready . the hostess was so rude and obnoxious that she should be reminded that she is behind the counter not in front . . . it put a real negative start to our evening . we have somewhat confusion with our bill ( no ones fault , including the bar ) and when she came racing down the street after us , more then once because she couldn ' t get the story correct , we gave her credit cards and all she can say was you don ' t expect me to take this back and fourth , don ' t you have cash . . . i told her no and she said she was run it back after awkward silence and her telling us that she is working and cant take the time to help out . she then took the card and did not return , only to be equally as rude to my wife when she had to go back to collect the card that she had no intention of returning , she should be fired ! however , the waitress at traif was so fantastic and kept apologizing for the women ' s behavior and she would try to make up our bad experience . on a positive note traif was great , food awesome . . . N stars because regardless if the food is good the hostess was horrible . 
i have given them one chance too many . each visit i have had some sort of issue with the wait staff , bill , etc and yet i have returned thinking it was a fluke . . . nope . . . becuase my recent visit was no better than the others . it seems they also changed their menu . . . went from a pretty large variety of items to a small , one page menu of basic items . . . apps and some burgers , wraps , etc . i think they have never been well known for their food and clearly are more of a nightclub bar where people are drinking and not ordering huge meals . that being said , they seriously need better trained wait staff . . . a few friends in my group were given attitude and treated rudely when they asked for some clarification on our bill . . . which was full of errors , overrides and adjustments . it looked like a mess ! not only that , but we had N tables for trivia night . . . not everyone knew one another and we sat separately . . . . the waitress put all N of us on one bill . . . talk about confusion . we managed to figure it out though and all agreed that we would not be utilizing a waitress in the future ( word of advice , order drinks at the bar and avoid ordering food all together ) . . . . doubt i ' d even eat there again . . . . not worth it for the hassle . food has always been mediocre . . . drinks are nothing special and pricey too , unless you get a happy hour group rate by making a reservation . i used to personally know the manager there and hoped to let him know of our experience but he apparently has been promoted within the company . . . hmmm . . . wonder if there is truth to that statement . i do give a star each rating for the vodka room with infused vodkas and the fact that there are live bands and a dj on the weekends . . . show up early to avoid the cover charge ! 
one of my favorite restaurants in the city . i was fortunate to be taken to talula ' s for an interview dinner and liked it so much i took my fiance here two weeks later . the energy , ambience , and decor are great . the feel is somewhere between casual and partially formal . the waiters wear jeans and sneakers and customers wear anything from jeans and a t shirt to a suit jacket and pants . i felt as if any attire is acceptable . i highly recommend the eight on the farm master collection cheese plate . this includes N pieces of cheeses from around the country as well as one from england and another from italy . my favorite piece was the espresso-topped one ( forgot the name ) . i ' m not the biggest cheese fan but this appetizer was amazing . i ordered the seared scallops that came with crisp capers and golden raisins . also had a pumpkin ale from a local brewery that was great . they have an outdoor that looks awesome and is even nicer than inside but it rained when we went . 
i love there onion pepper pizza it was really good . 
before going to watch avatar , my uncle keith , my cousin celina , and i headed over to soba-ya on e . Nth street . my uncle ' s philosophy is to stick to the restaurant ' s specialty , and soba-ya ' s is handmade soba noodles . we started with N appetizers tuna tartar with chopped mountain yam and avocado , tatsuta age - deep-fried marinated chicken , and some sort of fish liver pate . i wasn ' t too enthused about the mountain yam , but the crunchy texture was there to contrast with the tuna and avocado . another of my uncle ' s wise words japanese food is all about texture . the deep-fried chicken was lighter and more delicious than american deep-fried chicken - virtually guilt-free ! and the fish liver . . . omg , i loved it ! ! ! gleaming orange pate in ponzu sauce with a very clean taste ! main courses ? we all had cold soba my uncle ' s with uni ( fresh sea urchin with grated mountain yam ) my cousin ' s with tem zaru ( shrimp , shiso and shishito tempura ) and mine with ikura oroshi ( salmon roe and grated radish ) . my uncle likes sea urchin , but he discarded the grated mountain yam . why ? because it had a really disgusting texture - like okra when it ' s not fried . he said grated mountain yam is supposed to be like that . . . my cousin devoured her soba with shrimp tempura . i did the same with my ikura . i love salmon roe ! ! ! soba-ya is the only place i know where i can get salmon roe without it being piled on top of sushi rice and wrapped in nori . and they gave me a pretty good amount of it ! i figured , if soba noodles are going to cost N a bowl , i should get it with something that i can ' t eat anywhere else . totally worth it , and apparently cheaper than the soba with chicken . we finished off with dessert - milk tofu with strawberry . clean , light , and refreshing ! now , you ' re probably thinking , N for soba noodles ? ! outrageous ! but soba-ya has been around for over N years , so they must be doing something right . plus , handmade soba noodles taste remarkably better than store-bought ones ( of course ! ) . but it ' s also the japanese hospitality that i picked-up on warm towels before the start of the meal , the careful delivery and removal of the dishes . just one last word of advice order the large noodles ( N grams , at least ) if you ' re used to american portions ! 
i have to say , before starting this , i really should have known better . as a vegetarian , i should know my limits . but as my friend had heard of the famed halal guys , we made a trip to stand in the line that seems to be as famous as the food unceasing , largely homogeneous , and filled with grease-balls . the draw of the halal guys is simple basic , tasty food at heaping portions and low price . how this has been confused with some epic , life changing experience is beyond me . meals over rice are hefty and cost only N , but it left me wondering how much i would have paid to get moments spent in line back so i could do literally anything else with my time . something worthwhile , no doubt , like writing yelp reviews on my phone . as stated previously , i am vegetarian , so i cannot speak on the meat , which is obviously the draw . piles of minced chicken and lamb piled on the grill did not look particularly appetizing , but who am i to say ? nevertheless , from an aesthetic perspective , the score is a definite N . i ordered falafel over rice , and somewhat predictably , it was absolutely disgusting . it is entirely obvious that falafel is a complete after thought for halal guys . but more than i expected . bad falafel can be dry and brittle , and have little taste other than chalkiness . i have to say though , this is the worst falafel i have ever had . after less than N minutes , my meal was ready ( others may take N ) . maybe N deep fried lumps sat in my rice , and after attempting and failing to pierce them with a ( metal ) fork , i tried a bite to find they are completely inedible . they taste like deep fried rocks . N stars and not N because i feel i have to give them credit for knowing their client base well enough to not bother even giving one iota of a sh t about vegetarians . that almost takes guts . 
everything on menu delicious . have the pizza and off the menu yet to be disappointed
whoever claims this is authentic italian food is out of their mind ! i had a plain mozz pie and it was way below average . cheap cheese , sauce with no taste and crust that was undercooked and doughy ! tasted a little bit like domino ' s back in the day . i had a salad with chicken that was subpar and extremely expensive . he claims to have a authentic brick oven and he should be sued for false advertisement . pepes and modern , they have true brick ovens ! oregano joe cooks his pies in a rotating pizza oven similar to domino ' s . it is obvious this guy is a wanna-be ! tomie t . was correct . there are way too many great pizza joints in new haven county , orange and milford to waste your time on this place ! also , the girl was anything but friendly on the telephone . why give someone business that makes me feel like they are doing me a favor . they advertise like crazy to get business ( i got a menu and decided to try it ) and now i see why ! i do not think they have many repeat customers . take it from a true pisan , do not waste your time ! 
great customer service and food this weekend i went to nolita ' s for lunch and i chose to get the rigatoni carbonara because my waitress told me it was her favorite . she was right ! ! the food was delicious ! ! ! my waitress , milly , was so sweet and pleasant . she helped me make the best choice ! i strongly recommend this restaurant ! the bar area looks like fun too . i will be going back to nolita ' s with my friends . if you are looking for great food , a place with a great atmosphere and very helpful wait staff , then head to nolita ' s you won ' t be disappointed . if you don ' t know what to order then just ask milly . 
the food is rich , wholesome and delicious , albeit slightly too salty . 
bland , boring , stodgy and only marginally saved by its water views . this one should be for tourists only . 
the bf and i were eager to try bobby flay ' s latest venture and managed to snag a N Npm friday night reservation , N weeks ahead , for our anniversary back in april . the maitre d ' seated us near the front , however i remember thinking the back of the restaurant looking a lot nicer than the front but seems like they reserve that area for parties larger than N . . ? the bar seemed really cosy , too , not a bad option for walk-ins and drinks . the restaurant itself was not too loud , dimly lit ( but not too dark ) and trendy- like something out of a pottery barn catalog . service was up to par the waitstaff was friendly and gave us our space and time to enjoy our food . we started with N items off of the bar menu lamb tenderloin , chorizo crepinette , and the beef crudo . of the N , the crudo was the most memorable and i ' m not typically a fan of raw meat . the complimentary bread basket is always a nice touch . for our appetizer , we decided to go with the pizza with lamb sausage , which was good but it really was just like any other pizza and didn ' t taste as exotic as it sounded . for our mains , we ordered the tarragon chicken and porterhouse pork chop . i enjoyed both dishes a lot , probably favoring the pork chop a little more on account of the amazing polenta that came with it . when i return , i will probably order the pork chop again and try the kale paella that everybody raves about . i can ' t for the life of me remember why we didn ' t order the paella . . . and i regret it to this moment as i am writing this review . the only negative comment i would have is that our waiter clearly did not know how to pour wine nor how much to pour in a glass , something that i would not expect from a restaurant of this caliber with an extensive and curated wine list . overall , a solid N . N stars , but bumping it up to N because i got to see my favorite fn star , bobby flay , in the kitchen and later sitting at the bar after a long day ' s work . 
came for brunch on a rainy sat . empty and the hostess sat us in the bar under a tv . we asked to be moved to the regular dining room and the hostess reluctantly agreed . we were surprised by the very small menu . our server came over and was very brusque . a really negative vibe . we cancelled our order and left to go to jack ' s firehouse . 
decent curry , and i love cury , but the place suffers from indifferent staff , being a bit dirty and the annoying people who seem to hang around here doing ? ? ? ? 
if i lived in brooklyn i would totally get more stuff here . it is such a great place and such a great pizza . i like a get a whole pie to myself ad then stuffing as much as i can in my mouth . after that i take the rest to stuff in my fridge for break fast . i am totally into food like this . it is not such a difficult place to get to from jersey . 
i found out about this place by accident after searching for a similar place in a neighboring town on yelp . com . please note this restaurant is not closed like it indicates above . i came here with my husband last saturday and we both enjoyed the southern style food and friendly service . between the both of us , we had pulled chicken , grilled chicken , hush puppies , mashed potatoes , mac n ' cheese , candied yams and corn bread . everything was delicious ! you should definitely check this place out ! 
i have read so many reviews on other sites that were negative , i just couldn ' t resist trying it out for myself . at first , there was no hostess or anyone to seat us . maybe monday nights are slow and they do not need one . so the three of us sat ourselves and were eventually told by some guy that we have to seat in the dining room . my cannoli martini was warm but my salad was ok . my sisters chicken was bland but her apple martini was ok . my hunchback mongoloid cousin mike loved everything . the service was decent , however , the waiter seemed more interested in my cousins bump back . i got the waiters so we can text him next time we go . . . he said that he would give us a free combo if he can rub lotion on mike ' s mongoloid , dreadful , faulty , but very smooth prostrated cervical spine . so much for the reviews . . . this place was weird . 
helloooooooooo people . . . this isnt supposed to be an exquisite eatery . . i have no idea why people rate bars as if they were eating at one of wolfgang pucks stupid restaurants . . . . this place is a bar . . . . i repeat a bar . . . so if you eat here you ' ll get bar food nothing else . . . . so if jimmy or mandy dont like the food . . . . sorry too bad . . . its a bar . . . . . i dont know about the food . . but as far as the bar . . this place is a dream . . . no joke phenomenal draft beer . . . . . chill atmosphere . . . and the best thing in this bar . . . . it only has N tv ' s . . . . why is that good ? . . . it forces you talk to people ! ! ! ! which is something that is lost in the super crazy wanna be sports bars that have N tvs . . . . . that bar scene has infected the majority of bars in the city and around the country . . . . is there anyone out that has an attention span longer than N seconds ? all anyone does at bar nowadays is text or watch sports highlights . . when i go out i wanna hang out and i wanna have fresh tasting beers and tell crazy stories and meet great people . . . so this bar gets N stars for that reason . . . and thats that
malagueta restaurant is one of the finest in astoria , chef herbet gomes creates the most delicate and exotic meals that will satisfy the most demanding connoisseur of fine dining . we celebrated my birthday with a large group of friends and family last night , the service was phenomenal , drinks awesome and the food was the best , chef gomes at its best ! overall , well balanced restaurant and if you enjoy the finer things in life . . . . . this is the place ! 
 - ( a night that started off so strongly and had so much potential , took a very sad turn . . . the lobster at buddakan led to a date night with the porcelain princess instead of my beautiful fiance . service N . N stars the service at the bar and during dinner was impecible and precise . i was very impressed by their attentiveness and attention to detail . ambiance N stars buddakan is the closest thing in philadelphia to southern california-chic style restaurant design and vibe . price N stars the menu is definitely expensive . a night of dinner and drinks will run up to N per person for the full experience . location N . N stars a great location in old city at Nth and chestnut . food N stars my previous experiences at buddakan have been great . the food has been well prepared and delicious . this go around was different though . the lobster was tough and obviously poorly prepared . the kobe beef was more fatty than tender . the monk fish was good and the crab lo mein was delicious . i cant wait to give buddakan another chance to improve my impression and overall review . overall N stars despite my tough night , i look forward to another night at buddakan , hopefully to have an experience like my previous ones there . 
when we couldn ' t get a reservation at N madison park at a reasonable time , my husband and i decided to check out ai fiori for his birthday dinner . the food was phenomenal and a great value at N for a four-course prix fixe . the service was good . the space is ok - not particularly warm or exciting , but modern , neutral and clean . the restaurant is located in the setai hotel , and it being a hotel restaurant , there is only so much they can do about the crowd . the place has its share of annoying tourists and business people . but once the food is served , you forget all about the rest - it transports you to a better place , all your own . 
i ' ve been here twice now , once for dinner and once for just drinks and both times everything has been great . it ' s a super sexy venue , the staff is really attentive , the food and drinks are delicious . if you go for dinner , i highly recommend getting the yuca as a side . it was amazing . 
went there with a friend last night . amazing food , great atmosphere , friendly service . great neighborhood spot . will definitely come back although i live in manhattan . 
my husband and i went to amada during restaurant week and had a great time . it ' s the first time we ' ve been to one of jose garces ' restaurants , so i can ' t compare , but we ' d definitely go back . we went for a friday lunch on the last day of restaurant week . the servers were prompt and polite , although not overly friendly ( probably ready for rw to be over ) . for the first course we ordered ( along with the tinto sangria , which was excellent ) croquetas de jam n ( ham croquettes ) -- first thing out good and tasty , though nothing out-of-this-world . aged manchego cheese -- paired with crisp green apple slices and truffled lavender honey . i ' m still swooning a little bit from the honey . it is definitely heavy on the lavender , so be sure you like lavender before ordering . if you do , you won ' t be disappointed . second course beef brochettes -- the star of the meal ! if we ' d known how good they would be , we probably would ' ve ordered two plates . they were cooked medium rare , and when we weren ' t silently drooling about and simply enjoying how incredible they were , we were telling each other how incredible they were . these alone are a reason to come back . chorizo a la plancha -- this was tasty , although very , very salty . i only had one slice ( the plate came with three skewers with three slices apiece ) , and my husband had the rest . he commented that it was quite good , but that he was probably having his sodium intake for the week . chicken a la plancha romaine heart salad -- topped with shaved parmesan , migas , artichoke and creamy garlic dressing . the chicken was perfect and the salad refreshing . a nice pairing to our otherwise meat-heavy meal . shrimp a la plancha -- this was the only disappointment . i love seafood , and especially shrimp . the first of the three shrimp that i had was fantastic . my husband , who is usually so-so for seafood , was impressed enough with my reaction that he tried a bite of another one . then , he promptly washed out the taste with some sangria . the second and third shrimp were anything but good . very , very fishy . . a bit of a bummer because the seasonings were great ( although a bit salty again ) . for dessert , we got one of each pastel de chocolate -- flourless chocolate cake , chocolate ice cream , chocolate-hazelnut caramel . i ' m still sighing with happiness . this was intense and rich , but not excessively heavy . i would definitely get it again ! crema catalana -- vanilla custard , caramel veil , ginger , and pine nuts . delicious . my husband was more than happy to let me have a few bites , then leave the rest to him . perfect pairing of all the flavors . i think we ' ll definitely head back at some point -- probably not during restaurant week -- and see if the service is a little more up to par friendly . we will definitely order the beef brochettes ( if available ) , try some new dishes , order a few of our favorites , and stay away from the shrimp . all in all , a good first jose garces experience . . . definitely enough to convince us to come back ! 
i like ginza in bloomfield that ' s why i want to try this new take out restaurant , i don ' t like their sauce , they should have better teriyaki sauce , and i don ' t like their service too . 
hidden jewel ! great greek food for a very good price ! ! ! i would eat there everyday . try the gyro platter one of the best i have ever had . 
great place for breakfast and lunch . good quality and friendly staff . salads are hearty , lots of choices , non which disappoint . 
had a great waiter jason . food was delicious , especially the mac n cheese and pretzels . we all had different burgers and we all declared them super good . jason was pleasant , funny and very attentive . pat f
a friend and i had lunch here today and it was one of the worst experiences i ' ve ever had . the service was awful and the food was bad to average ( for non-authentic stuff . ) i ordered the lunch special salad , lo mein , vegetable dumplings and tofu vegetables coconut curry . to start off , when our waiter came to take our order , i asked if my side order of lo mein could come plain . he said yes , but acted as if i were an idiot for assuming otherwise . when the food came out , the runner said that they were out of veggie dumplings so they gave me a veggie egg roll . no big deal , i like egg rolls . . . only it wasn ' t a veggie egg roll . the Nnd bite i took revealed obvious chunks of pork . the manager saw us staring and picking at the egg roll and came over . he tried to tell me that it was tofu . i ' ve been a relatively non-picky vegetarian for N years and it ' s not a huge deal to me if i took one bite and got a little bit of meat , but he actually stood there and argued with me , exclaiming that it was ' fake meat tofu . ' sorry , but soy beans don ' t come in the stringy , striated variety and the pork in my egg roll was most definitely real pig , obvious by both sight and taste . i wasn ' t given a new , veggie egg roll or an apology for not having been asked what i would have liked as an alternative ( because i would ' ve chosen soup over and egg roll anyway . ) to top off the whole ' being told what is and isn ' t something i used to eat but haven ' t in N years and can tell what it really is ' thing , the lo mein was actually mei fun and came stir fried and drenched in soy sauce . the tofu in the curry was also cold ( a woman at a table next to ours also had cold food delivered . ) the curry base was actually pretty yummy , but because i didn ' t have anything to accompany it with the entire meal was pretty bad . . . i ended up eating the side salad and N or N bites of the curry and just leaving the rest . all in all the atmosphere is nice , but totally not worth the awful service and bad to mediocre food . we got there at opening ( N N am ) when they only had N or N other tables i can only imagine how bad it is during the lunch rush ! 
absolutely horrible in all aspects ! N hours to get my deliver on a thursday night . thee penne was dry hard and cold , the sauce was thick and flavorless and the meatballs were little more than lumps of hamburger that had been burnt than microwaved into hard , dry lumps of coal ! i mean , how do you screw up something as simple as pasta ? save your money and buy a can of spaghetti-o ' s ! at least they taste like something and is ready within N minutes of opening the can ! 
nothin to review best square and spumoni around get in the car train bus taxi and go get a slice . 
the food here is really good so i had to write something about it . i tried their falafel sandwich with a side order of zaatar fries . plus i also ordered the egg flatbread and ba ' al salad for take out . it took a little longer to get the food but the wait is worth it . also the lines were longer because it was lunch time . very tasty food and awesome variety of salads . i highly recommend trying this out for yourself . though they only take cash at the meantime so make sure to get some before you go there ! 
the " as you wish " dish is the best , if you like mushrooms and tofu ! ! ! ! delicious . and they offer it for lunch special too . 
smells bad from frites . guess it ' s from oil . sauces are not outstanding . 
this place is always crowded so expect a wait . advice drop someone in front to reserve your table while you circle for a parking spot . food is delish . i had the blackened salmon with jose ' s rice . my pi a coladas were perfection . wait staff is friendly . we had joseph , he was very attentive . the atmosphere is lively , and fun . 
good , clean , chill . 
sorry yelp reviewers . . . i don ' t know what all the fuss is about . i actually went here based on the glowing reviews and was honestly a bit grossed out . the soup i got had no flavor and i couldn ' t finish it . the next day i never felt so bloated by the amount of salt i had consumed from it . pass on this one . 
so being that there is no korean boon sik jip ( snack bar restaurant ) type of places in essex county i was pretty excited to try this place out . . . we ordered regular bulgogi taco and kimchi bulgogi taco . . . i think kimchi bulgogi was the better choice coz bulgogi in general tends to be on the dry side . . . and with kimchi it makes it less dry and adds the extra spicy kick to it . . . then we also ordered hae mul pa jun ( seafood scallion pancake ) . . . and oh gosh . . . it was no bueno ! it was wayy too thick , under-cooked . . . and the pancake batter was still runny ! wth ? and i don ' t understand why they don ' t have kim bap or dduk bok gi on the menu . . . ( i understand they might wanna target the non-korean population . . . but there is a pretty good number of us korean ppl in essex county u know ? also . . . being that this is a fusion restaurant . . . we were hoping there would be more " fusion " foods . . . besides the taco . . . 
this place is decent but a little bit overrated . you hear people from this neighborhood talk like this pizza is made of gold . it ' s good- crust it a little bit thin for my taste . there are better places on si to get pizza though ( brothers down the block for one ) . the staff is nice the dining room is kind of tight on the weekends and it ' s loud there . the most hilarious part is that when you sit down a waitress comes over and throws a stack of paper plates on the table with some forks and napkins and you set your own table . when you have it like that as a place you know the food must be pretty good , which it is , but it ' s just not so good that it would win any awards . i will say this though--- if you want a cool summer date night , denino ' s and then a ralph ' s ice across the street is a pretty sweet evening . 
i really enjoyed their hoagies . 
this is as good as some of the yakitori places you can find on st marks . price is reasonable and service was great . cow tongue was interesting and gizzard was really interesting . prawn was delicious as ever and most of all , people i was having dinner with were fun to talk to . if you are ever in the theater district and want some good japanese food , give this place a try . don ' t order udon though . 
it ' s a new location so everything is modern kept nice . the different sandwiches i ' ve had so far have been good . i need strong iced coffee when they first opened it was brewed to perfection . now i find it to be a bit watered down . 
such a great place to get a good sandwhich around this area . the staff is very friendly and makes the place very welcoming . didnt have a chance to sit down but the seating and atmosphere is comforting . free wifi and good pricing . simply a great place to sit and eat a sandwhich . ps . my fav is the stoopsih . i think they drench the chicken breast in franks wing sauce and its tasty ! shawwing
this place is too crowded . . . love the corn . 
this actually gets N stars out of N but i have no way of showing that on this review haha . went here on a weekday for a late lunch and there wasn ' t really a line but there was a steady stream of people coming in and out . ordered the plain cheese basil tomato pizza for my friend and i to share and it was literally out in N minutes , maybe even less . i think that the word ' perfection ' was invented after someone took a bite of this pizza . that is the only way i can describe it . love it ! if i could teleport , i would get grimaldi ' s for lunch every day ! 
one thing i can ' t deny is that this place has great food . my family and i would order from them at least once ( possibly twice ) a week . guaranteed though , they mess up at least one part to your order . last night , when we picked up our order and brought it home we ended up with fried pickles instead of mozzarella sticks and a white wrap instead of a whole wheat wrap . no biggy , we called back to ask them to correct our order , which they agreed to do , but asked for the food back . ew , to think they could possibly serve these items to someone else . they arrived Nmins later ( a time too long for the food ordered ) , took the food back and all was well . however , when i woke up this morning and left the house to my surprise i saw the pizza one boxes we had returned to the driver sprawled out in the road across from my neighbors house . the driver must have tossed the food out the window as he drove away . i guess on the bright side they didn ' t serve it to anyone else . but i can tell you i won ' t be ordering from there again . 
i had dinner here as part of a high school reunion . the staff was very welcoming to a large group and service was quick . we were seated on the outside patio and the staff was accommodating in adding tables and chairs . i thought the food was great and i would definitely go back for just the fries ! 
hi , upstate has the best oyster happy hour special . i also love the fettucini with clams . the seafood is great here . it ' s best to get there early for the specials and it ' s easier to get a seat . 
it ' s only a N second walk from my apartment , it ' s clean , new and cozy . the food is okay , it is what it is . i ' m under the impression that i ' m not the biggest fan because this isn ' t my style of food or because it ' s not done as well as it could be . the strongest part about this joint is the ambiance . 
national mechanics is an old city staple . they have decent food at decent prices , great waitstaff , ample space and i love the decor . the terrariums and orchids are killer and the place is always decorated for the season . right now they have a christmas tree hanging from the ceiling . they offer a good variety of drafts and bottles and also have cocktails . i mostly go here for lunch i work in old city and ' nat mech ' is our go to for lunch as a group . they aren ' t open on mondays for lunch , but you can ' t beat a good burger ( veggie or beef ) or my favorite , the popcorn chicken . always have plenty of seating room , good service and lunch is fairly priced for the area . happy hour during the week happy hour monday through friday is good with a manageable group . they have N off drafts from N-Npm . pro tip check the board , not the table card for drafts on tap . i don ' t go here on weekends i try to avoid national mechanics on friday and saturday nights . it ' s not them it ' s me ! they get swamped with people coming into the city for their night out and i ' d rather avoid that crowd . 
great food and ambiance . the cook was very personable . our waitress was the snarkiest i ' ve encountered in quite some time . 
 freaking good . . . . 
this place is an epic fail and i am surprised by all the positive reviews , especially from all the indian folks . have you never had indian food before ? i ' d rather do an amy ' s frozen rendition than this nonsense where rajma fronts like its daal makhani . this city is filled with really good places , why ' d any of you give it a positive rating ? on a side note-it ' s not " fine indian cuisine " -it ' s bangladeshi . 
the gnudi with brown butter is fantastic . the burgers and their shoestring fries are yum . is it worth an hour wait for a table ? no , not if you ' re hungry . is it worth having dinner early , when they first open ? and not having to wait ? yes ! 
the best afghan restaurant i have tried in the us . i really like their gyro platter and paradise burger . infact all their dishes are really good ! 
service was great ! loved the caesar salad hubby ' s fettuccine alfredo ! i last ate gnocchi in italy and ordered it hoping for the same experience as i ' d had during my travels . the gnocchi was ok . . . not bad but , definitely not as great as in italy either . the sauce was too sweet for me the gnocchi a tad to mushy . would definitely go back to this restaurant though to try out other entre s . 
total disappointment . great decor and atmosphere , way overpriced mediocre , at best , food . i ' ve eaten here twice , the first time was not so good , but it had just opened so i waited several months and came back to see if any improvement . nope , the meat and sides were of average quality with premium prices . i had the scallops which were fairly good , my girlfriend had the steak tartar which was heavy and tasteless . i had their new signature duck dish which sounded fabulous from the waiter , but ended up being pungent in taste with a runny sauce . my girlfriend had the salmon , which my guess is that it was cheap farm raised , as it tasted bland and wasn ' t flaky at all . the service was a little slow , but nice . the rustic decor was very good . i can ' t recommend this place though , as pricing versus the quality and taste of the food just doesn ' t match up . and , it is soooooo out of the way , i can ' t justify spending the time and money on a bad dining experience . if you want a drink or glass of wine , maybe . 
between the N of us we had chili verde with spicy pork , fajitas , and the enchilada trio . the food was good , the warm chips were lightly salted , and their house salsa had lots of cilantro . the house margarita had very little taste , almost like ice water with coloring . one of us got it rimmed with salt , after tasting it i used the salt shaker ! service was extremely slow . we were there at N N on a sunday , there were about N other tables , and it took us N minutes , and not our fault , we decided quickly but had to wait for service . i ' ll go back , i ' ll order beer from a bottle , and i ' ll plan on it being an event . 
i ' m old school chinese and maybe thats my downfall when it comes down to it all . but when i am paying upwards of N per person to a meal anything chinese related my expectations are private room , personal waiter N-N , with a total of N hours spent on eating , drinking , arguing , laughing , smoking , karaoke , and vomiting . sometimes not even in that order . but more importantly i expect a hell of a lot better food and not sit next to a bunch of people i don ' t know . . . but some may say . . . john this isn ' t china , this is usa where they don ' t do private rooms and things like that . . . . fine but at least give me a semblance of reconnecting to the origin of the dish you ' re trying to pawn off on me ! duck . . . nothing like peking or even chinatown duck . pork . . . . where the hell is the layers of happiness ? dim sum . . . yeah if you ' re trying to get filled off N dishes . go to amada for a better option . however , if you want to have a average meal while trying to impress a girl then go all out my friends . but if the girl likes this place as the " go-to-spot " and wants to go back there . . . you ' re on your own buddy . 
Nst time here , good prices , excellent noddles . i ordered duck noodles and good very little meat and lots of skin . service is fast but out of sequence , there was a gap between my meal and my sons meal , his rice came long after his chicken , and the soup came last . 
i was bookmarking my fav pizza joint on my computer and realized i had never reviewed them , yet i eat there almost twice weekly . i live right down the street so i always pick up , my food is always hot and tasty . i order the N " pies as well as tuna subs ( lettuce , tomato , toasted bread ) and jalape o poppers . i tend to be a creature of habit but sometimes i get radical and order a dinner , everything is always delicious ! it ' s a father son operation for the most part and as a regular you get to know the disposition of your favorite haunt , these guys are super friendly , we always chit chat but it ' s always busy so we keep it moving . i sincerely recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a nice italian meal , in fact i ' m making a call for a tuna sub and poppers right now ! 
roberta ' s is undergoing a serious case of resting on its laurels . having lived in bushwick for several years , i ' m grateful for any good place , especially one as ecologically and locally concerned as roberta ' s is . however , i feel every time i go the food keeps getting more and more " meh " . recently , the always satisfying bibb lettuce salad was lacking on the toppings and the kick . the daily special pizza we had was basically sparse meat crumbles on a sparingly sauced pie . also , the last few waitresses we ' ve had have been almost annoyed to even be working . i get the cool , brooklyn shtick but in a world where N is just expected , try a little harder . a smile never killed anyone . all this aside , its still a great hang out spot in summer . maybe by the time the garden thaws , they ' ll be back on the ball . 
i went here for the first time last night and i will most definitely be back ! some of the best italian food i ' ve ever had . the bread and the spicy olive oil , wow . the lasagna is classic and fabulous . the gnocchi was so fresh and tasty . incredible service , a wonderful bartender , i just wish i lived closer . 
my dinner party sat downstairs in the wine room . the food was wonderful . i highly recommend the soft shell crab . 
well priced and good food . and good service . . . had a perfect outdoor dinner . 
my friend lives around the corner from korzo . this is a great local bar to stop in and grab a quick drink . it ' s conveniently located n Nth ave and the prices are pretty good . the place is really clean and there is a tv located at the bar where you can catch the game as well . it ' s one of my favorite places to just sit and relax . 
disappointment . after hearing friends speak highly of cafe lift , we gave it a try and its very possible we won ' t be back . the wait for a late saturday morning wasn ' t long , but i may have been more comfortable standing in the waiting area , rather than be seated . the space behind my chair was considerably large and although i am tiny and had my body was scooted tight against the table , somehow waitresses were still bumping into my chair . not to mention we were so close to the group next to us , i could practically feel their breath . after taking our order , our food came at least N minutes later . i understood they were super busy , it was the weekend of course , and decided to forget about how long it took and enjoy the cannoli french toast i was dying to try . too bad it was cold . and yes the french toast was huge , but extremely dry , i felt like i was drenching it in syrup after every bite . maybe if my friends drag me here , i ' ll experience a better meal next time , but if not cafe lift will remain at the bottom of my list for brunch . 
N of us went to the hamden pacific buffet grill to celebrate my sister ' s college graduation - N day later , N of us were sick with food poisoning . when i called the general manager , tommy lee - he basically told me there was nothing he could do ! is this how you treat your customers ? ? ? 
if your from montclair you appreciate great eats that sill deliver . this is one of them . i love how clean they are and that the food is always fresh . they serve generous portions and the staff is pleasant . 
nice place with a big burger ( not so big as they are in brazil ) . unfortunatelly , once i went there and would like to order just a beer , but the waiter said that as we were on a table we need to order something to eat also . 
delicious ! my husband and i are a bit obsessed with stix ! as vegans , we have many delicious options and have never been disappointed . their kale , jalape o hummus , fries , couscous , lentil salad and vegetable skewers are not to be missed ! we are always surrounded by people eating non-vegan items and they are always raving about how good it tastes . always friendly and always delicious ! 
only get delivery if you enjoy waiting two hours for food , and enjoy cold fries sandwiches and melted shakes . i ' ve never had a worst experience with delivery in my life and this place is only N . N miles away from my house . theres no reason why my food was cold . i ' d give zero stars if i could . 
this place is so sweet ! the decor is very williamsburg , with black and white checkered tile , a tin roof , and a dark wood bar . the service was super friendly . we got seated right away despite the restaurant being full around Npm on a sunday . the chicken and waffles was some of the best i ' ve had in brooklyn -- delicious syrup , hot sauce , and crispy piping hot chicken . prices are average -- brunch ranges between N and N . bloody mary was good but not amazing , and definitely on the spicy side . i ' ll be back ! 
have been there a couple of times for lunch on thursdays the last month . the wings are huge and juicy cook to perfection . thursdays is burger day at new socials N . N . every week they offer different burgers today N different ones ! huge fresh burgers . service is top self , friendly , and fast . 
i went with a group of friends last week and i had forgotten why i stopped going to this place . the reasons the food mediocre at it ' s best and the options boring . once i saw the menu i remembered why i had stopped coming in . the menu has not changed in years ! what is it with restaurants that do not grow or expand their menu ? ? the same o ' l boring items as if time had stopped . now i promised to myself i will not be back nor put my friends through the mediocrity . 
ever had food that leaves you wanting more even when you ate plenty ? well this is one place i can say is hard to choose when you absolutely want everything ! delicious mediterranean and garden melt . great selection of wine . the staff knows the food and it ' s ingredients as well as very hospitable and courteous . definitely enjoyed myself and will be returning . 
extremely disappointed . chicken tandoori was nothing more than broiled chicken with a commercial tandoori sauce basted on at the end . not authentic - not even tasty . saag lamb consisted of either frozen or canned cream spinach and a few tiny chunks of tough lamb . ugh . also overpriced for what they give you . will not be back . 
definitely an improvement since lunello bought them out , but i definitely wouldn ' t recommend it . mediocre and uninspired . 
i am disappointed to have had a mediocre experience at bouley on mothers day . first of all , make sure to request a room on the main floor . if you are seated in the basement , the service will suffer . guaranteed . furthermore , the atmosphere is much darker , danker , and mustier . and the chandeliers are embarrassing . the food itself was good , but i have enjoyed much better flavors here . my table was split on the tomato soup amuse bouche . my biggest disappointment was the duck , which i remember being absolutely sublime , but this time , smaller and simpler . the biggest problem i had was the service here . it was confused , with a waiter telling me outright " this peach soup is a special that is not on the menu " and i had to tell him it actually was on the menu . plates were left on the table . our wait between tastes was upwards of N minutes . food was dropped on our plates with no description or explanation . it was not a michelin experience . i would only return if i was guaranteed a seat on the main floor . 
seeing the melting of the white styro-foam box sticking on those hot dumpling freshly fried on the pan and got thrown in that box . . . is kindda creep me out a bit . - like you guys eat that ? isn ' t it chemical ? if not because of this , i would have been a fan . 
the dead rabbit is literally right around the corner from where i work , but i ' ve never been until last october , when a person i was meeting up with suggested this site . atmosphere it ' s a pub , but not divey in the least . very clean . ambience low-key , but the downstairs section of the bar gets very cramped very fast as more people come in after work . but despite the crowds , it really never gets noisy at all . i can ' t speak of the upstairs , as it was closed off at the time i was there . crowd mix of wall street types and blue collar workers alike . friendly bartenders . fare the food menu was mostly composed of english and irish pub food . the bar also offers seasonal mixed drinks and of course , beer . my associate and i had a few fruity cocktails which i completely forgot the name of , that were quite tasty and strong . we also split the ploughman ' s lunch , which is a platter of assorted cheeses , grapes , pickled veggies , bread and nuts . it made for a nice appetizer or a light dinner . this place is very cool , but i probably would only come back again if i was meeting someone for drinks after work . 
dinner , saturday august N , N service was attentive , almost too much . familiar waiter , but maybe that ' s just the style of the restaurant . if i have a carafe of water on the table i don ' t expect to have my glass topped off every time i take a sip . feels like the nsa is watching . . . appetizer , broccoli rabe and sausage very good . rabe was tangy but not overly bitter , and the sausage cut in thin slices and fried crisp for a nice contrast . lots of garlic . salad the garden salad looked like it had been mass-produced earlier , wrapped in plastic and chilled until ready to be served . it arrived mashed down , slightly limp , and downright depressed looking . a tub of coagulated house dressing on the side , way too much , and the plate was much to small to be able to mix it , so i just dipped the cucumber , carrot slivers , and rather sad piece of tomato into the dressing and left the rest . main course cioppino amalfitana . they used to call this zuppa di pesce i think cioppino is a more expensive name . seafood was reasonably plentiful and well prepared -- even the calamari weren ' t rubbery . but the sauce was really too greasy . you don ' t go here for the d cor or quiet atmosphere . but of course they play sinatra nonstop and that can ' t be bad . 
so , three friends go to nyc on a college budget and have the time of their lives ! ! ! we stayed at a hostel that ran about N per person near central park ( only a block from the c train ) and explored the city as the nyc virgins that we were . . anyway , we wanted some italian food one night and were too far from little italy so we looked in one of the tour guide pamphlets that we had picked up somewhere and there it was , an add for tony di napoli . . . we asked for directions , walked on in ( realized that we were way underdressed ) and ordered one plate of cheese ravioli for the three of us to share and omg ! ! ! ! that was hands down the best meal we had the entire time we were in nyc . . . and the fact that all three of us ate from one plate ? ! ? ! ? it was awesome ! i ' m not saying that the three of us got stuffed , but we ate to the point of blissful satisfaction and fell in love . . . if i ever get a chance to go back to the nyc , i ' m going back . . . and hopefully i ' ll have more money to be able to order a little more ! love this place ! ! 
we have been eating here from the first day this restaurant has opened and have been regulars here ever since . at first it was great . they had wonderful food and great beer on tap and this was all true for the first few months . i really went there because they had hoegaarden on tap which was my favorite beer . first they changed the hoegaarden to bud light wheat . why you need three taps for bud products and take out a fine import in the process is beyond me . then i stopped going for awhile after this happened until i found they got southampton double white on tap . this was now my new favorite beer since i found it where they brew it at public house in southampton and when i knew riverwalk had it we began to go regularly once again . all of a sudden a few weeks ago they replaced this beer on me again and i was very upset but still ate that night and have not returned since . we do however still order take out from time to time . now every time we go to make an order , something we come to like is not available or as we are told by whoever answers the phone to take the order in there tries to change the menu . this has happened now at least a half dozen times . this last time was tonight where they told us they no longer had a simple turkey club sandwich . we refused to place the order and are getting chinese instead . i am greatly unhappy that this constantly happens . this is why you have a specials menu . you keep the regular menu mostly the same and try specials to see if they do well and get feedback from them , not constantly change the regular menu . how are you supposed to get used to anything if you keep changing it . you also do not constantly change your regular menu because most regulars come to like certain things and that is why they keep coming back . and telling the owner does absolutely nothing seeing as there is a new brother running it almost every time we go there . i am not spending any more money at a place that i am constantly unsatisfied and have to change my original order to something less appealing because of the regular changes that occur every single week there . and lastly we used to tell anyone we knew in the area to try it out because of how great it was and now unfortunately we have to direct people elsewhere . 
for their prices i ' d expect the best steak of my life . i did not get it . never going back . their menu prices are insulting . 
first visit here and i will be back . excellent selection of beers - i had the goose island ipa . nice , warm decor and the bartender made us feel right at home . he was attentive without being annoying . we split the blue balls app and the lamb sliders with fries . can ' t go wrong with deep fried mashed potatoes surrounding short rib and blue cheese ! lamb sliders were flavorful and the pickle was the right tartness and crunch . 
excellent . 
i came here with two friends on a random wednesday evening and waited about an hour and fifteen minutes in the cold before hearing out our name called out in a heavy japanese accent . after careful consideration ( and reading a lot of yelp reviews ) , i chose the totto spicy ramen with extra bamboo shoots . we didn ' t have to wait long and because we were seated at the bar , we got a front row seat of seeing our ramen being prepared . the ramen was cooked just enough without being too soft and the broth was delicious . the cooks ( especially the one with the whiskers ) were outgoing and super funny , which made our meal even better . overall , it was a great meal but be prepared to wait an hour even on a random week night ( unless you go by yourself ) because the place literally only has N seats . do yourself a favor and don ' t come with a big group ( N is the easiest size to get seated ) because there are only N tables that can sit up to N . 
i personally liked the stark decor - it was simple , but the atmosphere was still cozy and warm . the food was great - small plates , with a lot of vegetarian options - great for sharing . the waiters were very friendly and competent . make sure you byob if you wanna drink , and be prepared to talk loudly . 
the food is delicious and i enjoy the service . i wish that the atmosphere was a little more charming . many times i just go with take out . 
i ' ve been coming here frequently over the last N - N years . it has really grown in popularity , especially during football season , but maintains the warm hospitality that makes a local tavern special . i continue to frequent maggie ' s because the food is good , the staff is friendly and competent , the prices are reasonable , and it is a very comfortable place to meet my friends for a little while . finally , maggie ' s town tavern leaves me feeling like a valued guest . i wish more businesses were run this way . 
hey if you ' re feeling hip and want to eat an entree that most people would consider piffle , then beau monde is the joint for you ! hey , history has shown that you can take something like a bagel or a croissant and fill it up and serve it as a big to-do and make lots of money on it , so why not do it with crepes ? why not , indeed ! the only thing i don ' t get is why they have to do it like it ' s some big-ass deal . great , it ' s a crepe that i can get in regular or wheat and then fill it up with various goos , how is this any different from a pizza ? my fave pizza joints don ' t cost much at all , so why am i dishing out the dollars for a glorified pastry with beef wellington in it ? why , indeed ! oh , it ' s fine . however , dollface ordered one with scallops in it and a couple of them were orange . when she asked the waiter about this , wondering if anything was wrong with them , he told her that they had had many questions about that very thing that day and would ask what the reason was as he had apparently forgotten it . upon his return , he informed us that the chefs told him that some of the scallops had gotten " more oxygen " than others . ok . whatever . i ate the two freak-ass orange scallops as she was afraid to and they were fine . after din-din , we had a cherry crepe that was very , very good . in fact , i could quite understand going to this place and just getting dessert crepes . they could still tone down the b . s . , though . it ' s not half as amazing as the staff would have you believe . 
visited this restaurant about a week and a half ago on a saturday night was only going to have a drink and go somewhere else for dinner but decided to stay . the bartender was very accommodating and give us great attention . he suggested very good recomendations from the menu and the drinks list . i was unable to finish my main course and took it home normally would not eat food i take home the next day but even heated up again it was wonderful . i realize this is a relatively new restaurant so was impressed as usually takes time for places to establish . can ' t wait to go back this saturday night and bring my husband hope the same irish bartender is working great young man so mannerly . 
had a great dinner at the very attractive hunters of brooklyn . the menu was diverse and the food delicious . every appetizer was delicious but the mussels and the grilled kale salad were excellent . our entrees also were wonderful with the parpadelle with boar ragu and the roasted cod leading the pack . and whatever you do don ' t miss the maple sweet potato mash as a side dish and the riccota fritters for dessert . we were four and loved our dinner . our friends were locals ( brooklyn heights ) and we were from long island and made the trip in just to eat at hunters . so worth the drive . can ' t wait to spread the word . can ' t wait to come back ! ! ! bon appetit everyone ! 
felt like a more authentic version of chipotle ( yay mexican staff ) . got the pollo asada burrito for N . the chicken is soooo tender and flavorful . i appreciate that . i also appreciate that the slice of queso is a basic , not an added option of the ' rito . veggies and sides were fresh , as the turnover was super fast . stackin dat cheese dos toros is . their salsa verde ( medium sauce ) is actually decently spicy ! ! ! just the right amount to keep your masochistic tongue wanting another bite . so good omg . their lines are hella efficient a la chipotle , and their menu is no-bullshit , necessities only . i ' m really really excited to try their tacos and quesadillas . if only they could bring some more creativity to their menu though , like a new , unique item from time to time . chill ambiance , cozy and " authentic " looking . but ha , we all know that you gotta go ghetto for any authentic mexican food . 
pizza is a funny thing . it ' s easy to make a decent pizza just about any place can do it . but it ' s hard to make a really good one . my family used to go to foxy ' s on a semi-regular basis when i lived in ct . i dropped by again while visiting my folks over the holidays . have you ever not had something in a really , really long time , and you get worried that it won ' t be as good as you remember it ? well , it turned out there wasn ' t anything to worry about . this is the only place where i actually look forward to eating the crusts . 
my puerto rican friend brought me here one night for dinner because i ' ve never had pr food . i totally loved it , and i don ' t understand why there aren ' t more puerto rican restaurants . we usually go there at night . its crowded , but we can always find a table . even though the people who work there are all mexican , they really do puerto rican food justice , or so my friend says . the service is minimal , but quite good . the food gets out very soon . here ' s how my friend i usually order we each get rice beans and share a meat , avacado , and something else . then we just eat everything all together . oh , and they also have goya juices , so you have to get one of those if you don ' t want coffee . i ' ve never tried the cafe con leche , but i ' m sure its delicious . our bill came out to be a little over N , which was a great deal considering how full we were . oh , and i know that a dance floor would totally throw off the diner style feel of the place , but the music is so great that i always want to start salsa-ing around la taza de oro
mushroom pizza is delicious ! love the crust - so crunchy and chewy in all the right ways . service was good and i would definitely go back ! 
perfectly horrible , greasy and absolutely death provoking . ughh . whats all the hype . at least at mcdonalds and burger king the fries are crispy and not limp . 
the first thing we noticed as we were taken to our large table was the sheer size of the space this restaurant occupies . the attention to detail on the design flowed through the delicious menu items and the incredibly attentive service . loved the evening . 
staff not that friendly . food was just okay , and the dessert was terrible ! we will not be going back . 
wow really elegant , really tasty the restaurant itself is really well decorated - young and modern . they give you a little labane and fresh crackers right after you order ( love that ) - which gets you started off the grape leaves , labane with artichokes , and roasted eggplant were awesome . the taboule is not the best - but still refreshing next to all the other dishes . apparently the chicken kebabs are also excellent . 
horrible service . only our waitress , too . all the other waitresses and waiters were decent ok , cept ours was a biatch . just cuz your restaurant is famous and " all that " , doesn ' t mean you can throw customer service out the window . seriously , if the first impression was bad , it doesn ' t make a difference how good your food tasted afterward , it won ' t mean much . and it didn ' t taste all that , at that . if this is the best chinatown has to offer , then flushing ' s got you covered and then some . never returning . there isn ' t anything i can get here that i can ' t get elsewhere . 
fresh off my very rewarding and fun , yet plaque-inducing and lifespan-shortening , quest to find the best fried dumpling in the city , i decided to embark upon another culinary project finding the best banh mi sandwich in the city . i guess i have my ever-so suffocating credit card bills to thank for this delicious endeavor . armed with a crisp N-dollar bill and the addresses of five sandwich shops around chinatown , i amassed five ' N ' s and promptly wolfed them down with the help of another equally gluttonous individual , and we both declared this place the winner . let me tell you , if jared had any self-respecting tastebuds or if subway didn ' t pay him boatloads of money , he ' d be the morbidly obese , but very very happy , spokesperson for saigon banh mi . the bread has that great crunchy and chewey texture , providing the perfect backdrop for the fillings . inside , the crisp and juicy vegetables are a terrific constrast to the tender and flavorful meat slices . although you can ' t get both in each bite since the sandwiches are rather big , you ' ll enjoy the alternating sensations of every subsequent mouthful . ultimately , even though each shop proffers a respectable sandwich , this place has the best product . one thing that is lacking about this place , however , is the absence of a shtick . it ' s not that difficult to find . the owners are nice and flexible with your orders . the wait is generally manageable . there are no special selections written only in chinese vietnamese containing dog meat . frankly , there is just nothing else exciting about going to place . true , the menu is relatively limited compared to some of the other shops , and their remaining items such as candies and appetizers are somewhat expensive , but their sandwiches are truly delicious . try it , you ' ll swear you are eating crack cocaine on a bun from a jewelry store in chinatown . 
there is no sign out front with a name of this place , just pizza and deli signs . so i checked it out finally , there were multiple pizzas waiting to be warmed up and a whole deli menu . i opted for the chicken parm on a roll which comes with a can of soda and chips for N . N- not bad at all . he warmed the whole sandwich in the oven but it was still cold in the middle . it was still pretty good though , the chicken was shredded and seasoned . will be back
seems like a fine neighborhood joint , but was definitely not worth the trip out from manhattan . the food was fine ( mussels , clams , salad , and fish ) , the service was less than stellar ( restaurant was planning to close the next morning for a week of vacation , so perhaps that ' s why ? ) , and the ambience was okay . if you ' re looking for the typical nj italo-american style restaurant , this is your place . if you ' re looking for something a little less kitchsy and of better value , you might want to go elsewhere ( N a person for the above food sorbet isn ' t exactly a great deal . . . especially when you ' re not wowed by the food ) . 
this place is great ! high quality , fresh ingredients , ample portions and one of a kind drinks ! also the staff is attentive and the architecture of the building inside and out is beautiful ! highly recommend , even if it is a half hour drive . 
i start by saying the food we ate was very good . however , our overall experience was lacking to say the least . i went to eataly with a small group of friends last weekend . we planned to have wine and snack downstairs and then proceed to the rooftop for dinner . we had wine and cheese meat platters downstairs to the tune of N . the food and wine was good . we proceeded to the greeter to take the elevator upstairs . the " greeter " was less than friendly to say the least . we finally got upstairs and were informed we would need to wait N minutes for a table ( we had a reservation by the way for the time we arrived ) . we went to the bar and spent another N on wine for our group . when we got to the table and started to order dinner a couple of people only wanted a salad and were planning to also get dessert . our server promptly informed us we had to leave . what ? we were impolitely told everyone was required to order an entr e or we would need to leave . yet again , what ? she finally told us we had ordered enough food to stay . nice ! thank you for making us feel so welcome . the food was fine , but it couldn ' t get rid of the bad taste of being treated so poorly . when we finished dinner our server threw our check on the table and stomped off . needless to say we promptly paid and left . ( we had dessert at a lovely little place down the street . wow , i think they were happy we were there just to have cake and coffee . ) after dropping over N at eataly and leaving feeling unwelcome i ' ll never go back . it ' s obvious the owners think a little too highly of themselves . they need to remember they are in a service industry . 
i ' ve been coming to salt and fat since they opened and truly believe they have the best dishes in sunnyside . so good , whenever i ' ve considered moving , i think to myself " but then salt and fat won ' t be a walking distance away anymore ! " . they have such great prices and the tastiness of every dish is undeniable . must haves there are the scallops , terrine and the foie gras ! the bacon brittle component in the foie is enough to keep me coming back ! my only disappointment is the disappearance of the pork belly tacos and the pickled watermelon that used to come with the chicken . their thai ice tea ice cream and yuzu sorbet are also incredible ! it ' s always been hard for me not to take some home after an excellent meal ! the chef is very personable and the staff is very friendly ! i love that the dishes dishes are top notch and the atmosphere is casual . everyone i ' ve referred there has become a repeat guest and i always look forward to coming back ! bravo salt and fat for giving sunnyside eatery bragging rights ! 
worst pizza i ' ve had in my life . we first ordered a white pizza , it was awful . the mozzarella looks and tastes like the caulking around my bathroom sink ! chewy , tasteless , like plastic . we thought maybe white pizza isn ' t their specialty , that the regular ones might be to die for , coz , after all , grimaldi ' s got itself famous with pizza . so we ordered another , regular , pizza . turned out it ' s the same thing -- caulking , with tomato sauce this time . one word for grimaldi ' s yuck ! 
noodle village was recommended by a friend and has some of the best beef chow fun and clay pot rice i ' ve ever eaten . beef chow fun has a tendency to be greasy at a lot of places , but they were dry , tasty , and had that elusive ' wok hay ' taste . the clay pot rice with pork and salted fish exceeded expectations and we happily scraped the crispy bits from the bottom . the congee was better than congee village and the place gets props for being clean and having friendly service . 
exquisite place . i had N big events at roma both with which were amazing . charlie ( the owner ) was excellent . he catered to our needs and presented us with fabulous meals . . . all our guests were impressed that now he has gained even more customers . recently he has extended his building to add another party room . the room that we used could accommodate about N people and had more than enough room for a dj . i had my wedding and his restaurant my son ' s baptism and everyone was very pleased with the service and the food . i highly recommend this restaurant for either family dining and or party entertaining . 
all right , i ' m moving this up to five stars . it was close , anyway , and the generous anniversary party they threw yesterday pushed them into the top category for me . they appear to have even more vegan milk choices than before , which hardly seemed possible , and the service is consistently outstanding . i don ' t know of an all-vegan environment anywhere that offers better value , service , and ambiance , with a splendid selection of drinks and good coffee shop-style food . thanks , grindcore house ! 
totto ramen is superb ! i really like to go to this place . i could eat their noodles every day . i have been there twice and both times the place was packed . usually i get there just before they open so i can have a lucnh in the first round . try the tuna sashimi and the tuna with avocado is pretty awesome too . 
on a recent work trip N of us had dinner here . i had the monk fish dish which was great . the place was empty other than our group which was a little alarming . even with the lack of patrons in the place it took the restaurant over a half hour to get our meals to us . also , the waiter forgot our order for a bottle of wine . so food was great , service not so great . four stars . . . 
i ' m sorry to say this , but the one i had was a little dry and not all that tender . maybe it ' s because it ' s sliced thicker . 
the food is good , but it can be really bland depending on what you order . for instance , you may end up with half of a boiled chicken ( bone-in ) on top of rice with no seasoning . so , unless this floats your boat , make sure you know what you are ordering . this restaurant has quite a few bone in foods , including thier duck and noodle soup . you are better off asking before ordering , or you may be stuck eating clumbsily with your hands- not a pretty sight . some dishes are amazing , and all have really good portion sizes . they are a bit light on the vegetables . the atmosphere is bare bones and no nonsense- not a place to take a romantic date- but the food is cheap and can be amazing . 
best food in nyc ! ! ! i go there every time i ' m in town , which is every N weeks . i highly recommend the spinach ravioli and pizza with smoked cheese and speck . 
had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant N N N . when the hostess called us to be seated for our N Np reservation , we didn ' t even realize it was N N . we were told our bar tab was being taken care of by the owner , who came over to graciously apologize for seating us so late . and , two tapas were sent over to our table as well . as we never complained , this is a great example of a man with pride in ownership , and fully aware of everything going on in a very busy restaurant . as for the food and ambiance , both excellent . attentive service . charcutero , croquettes , pork special with tasty , juicy meat and crispy skin . . . all fantastic , will definitely return ! 
i just realized when we went to this spot that it was where arunee use to be . overall when it comes to the changes they made i would give them a five star but as far as the food i was a little disappointed . i had this place bookmarked for a while and it was also recommended by a friend but i guess you can say my particular visit there only deserves a three star . we ordered the roti , seafood pad se ew , tom yum soup , seafood thai fried rice and mango salad . the portions are pretty small compared to what i ' m used too . the tom yum soup was good . it had a light spice to it and it was flavorful . the thai fried rice with shrimp was a bit small in portion but i got two raw shrimp pieces in the dish so we ended up only eating the rice part . roti was fabulous . my husband and i had mix feelings because it was on the sweet side which i prefer . it ' s basically sweet curry , no spice at all . so it really depends on the persons preference but if you have a sweet tooth like me then you ' d like it cause i did . the pad see ew needs a bit more flavor . mango salad is one of my favorites but it wasn ' t as sweet , they used green mangos so it was a little hard and dry then the ones i ' ve grown to really like . over all i think this place has potential but i ' m just a little picky on thai food because it ' s not my favorite but some places just make it really good that i ' ve started to love it . on a side note service was great and on point . our waiters were there and took care of us flawlessly . regardless try this place ! it was just one visit for me maybe it just didn ' t go well . 
i have been to and worked at several mexican restaurants and none of them compare to maddys mexican grill . my fiance and i went there this past saturday night i will admit we were a little skeptical since it was our first time there . however , the atmosphere , owner , and music made me feel so welcomed and comfortable . not only was the customer service great but the food was awesome ! they offer the american-mexican type of food and traditional mexican style . everything is homemade and delicious . i definitely recommend this place ! ! 
food is always amazing . you can make a meal out of the appetizers . whenever i walk by beyoglu , the line has been out the door-really better to go at off peak times . can get very loud but always worth the noise . 
i have been going to sing ' s for years and they are one of the best take outs in the area . they treat you well and will custom cook with more or less spice if you ask . they always put in something at no charge if you go over N so for a family , it ' s well worth it . i have tried almost every chinese take out in the southern west haven area and sing ' s beats them all . 
great food , decent service . . . 
i have been around new york and i must say anthony and son panini shoppe is my absolute favorite place to dine in , there food is amazinggggggggg the absolute best ! i love their staff they always greet everyone with a smile and it ' s just overall good vibes in this place . their nutella milkshake is wonderful ! delivery is always on time , never late and the food always arrives hot . the owner sabino is great he is such an easy guy to start a good conversation with , i have never had one negative thing to say about this place . i will always turn to this shop when i want good food around maspeth and brooklyn . on top of the food being amazing i had ask the owner about the meaning of the fdny sandwich i think it ' s so kind that this shop dedicates one of their famous sandwiches on the heros of ny . their is literally no other panini shop better than anthony and son panini shoppe , i recently found out they cater also , i might even think of having them host one of my company parties , thats how amazing they are i wouldn ' t turn to any other place but them , forget subways , quality food is at the panini shoppe . 
i am a vegetarian and i liked the cheese veggie pizzas here . the buy N , get N deal is great . i was always a fan of singa ' s pizza and my kids also like it . i wish they accepted cards . 
calling this place good is like calling sex , reproduction . 
i came here to watch a football game with some girlfriends on a sunday evening . i didn ' t expect this spot to be so awesome . the service was great , the staff was friendly , giving out recommendations and letting me try anything before i ordered it ( drink wise ) . we weren ' t planning on eating , but everything going by us just looked and smelled so good . everything was delicious . i highly recommend ! 
t ' s very small but in a cosy way that was just perfect . lovely staff and the food was amazing . hot food , which in a country where the food is mostly cold before it gets to your table says a lot ! ! ! highly recommend . 
completely renovated , great food , fantastic decor and super nice service staff . definitely coming back many times
wonderful place . my friends and i meet here frequently . whether we ' re there for lunch or at Nam , the food is still great and the service awesome . the people here are very friendly and always look sincerely happy to see you . 
this place is so good it makes run home to my computer to write this up . this is what i ' ve been looking for , i had a little trouble finding it but i can say now that i know about it i ' m very satisified and would like to recommend it so , it ' s easier for others to find out about it in the future . good soldi quality and friendly people . 
we started with our wine order , which our waiter promptly forgot . returning N minutes later our waiter asked if we were ready to order . we asked about our wine order . he asked if we had ordered . ( apparently a good memory is not a requirement to get hired here . ) after N minutes he returned with our wine but no opener . returning with an opener he poured a taste and promptly left . his hands would never touch our bottle again . ( self serve at N . N bottles ! ) the unisex bathrooms are a wonderful game of guess who , is anyone in there ? seriously , there is no indicator to tell you whether one is occupied . love knocking on bathroom doors . really love the communal sink , where diners can regale each other with their excitement . this is haute cuisine in new york ! after making reservations one month in advance i was thrilled when our food finally arrived . my thrill left quickly thereafter . salumeria plate came with N tablespoon plods of buffalo mozzarella , N pieces each of sopressata , prosciutto , and salami . ( who knows the origin , our waiter certainly didn ' t . ) eat ! no questions ! a menu of italian heritage without salad ! genius ! ( if there is any salad it is displayed in as clandestine a fashion as possible . ) a single ravioli the size of a starbucks coffee lid . a pasta served with a room temperature rabbit sauce , scant pieces of rabbit meat that could have been quail , or squirrel , or chicken . . . the NxN pear cake and vanilla-less vanilla ice cream were too horrifying to be unforgettable . one of the absolute highlights , and wow , i am still recollecting , was when our waiter brought new clean plates and simply placed them on our table . both my dinner date and i looked up from our scant appetizer plates and marveled at the glistening white plates laid before us . empty . pointless . our waiter had the brilliant explanation that we would need them for our next course . but why would he ever bring them with our next course ? ? ? when recalling the blank stares , unanswered questions , and numerous expressions that said " i would rather be watching my dvr " i cannot contain myself . honestly , danny meyer ' s restaurants are known for their service , but what we received at maialino was the complete opposite . i swear that at one point i thought i was being punk ' d or something . i have often wished for a fine dining experience in new york that left me trembling with hunger and feeling unsatisfied , completely . ( this must be how supermodels dine ) this was sooo much more fun than simply setting my money on fire in an alley . ( the value was equivalent . ) all in all i am concerned that mr . meyer has been coerced into licensing his name to some mega restaurant chain . this restaurant shares nothing in either quality or service with any of mr . meyer ' s other restaurants . i have dined multiple times at eleven madison , union square , and even tabla ( when there was a tabla ) . i stand amongst the devoted who patiently line up in union square park for a shake shack burger . i cannot and will not stand for maialino . 
good breads . mostly known as a place you can see nora ephron and other hollywood insiders . basically just a box dropped in the middle of the meadows . noisy as hell at supper-time . 
i went here recently with my daughter for her birthday - it was a great experience - the food was delicious . 
this is one of the best chinese restaurants i ' ve ever ordered from in connecticut . since i am a college student who lives on campus , i consider ordering from king chef when i ' m in the mood for chinese food . plus , since i have allergies , the steamed menu is the best option for me . 
my roommate and i came here to celebrate his birthday , after a riotous uproarious performance at bam , following our combined consumption of about a liter of bourbon . an overflowing glass of taittinger for each of us was a perfect beginning to our meal . the atmosphere in the bar is incredible , very lively but also discreet and celebratory . the dining-room environment is a little less inviting , in my opinion , because there are a few too many tables , plus a few too many members of waitstaff buzzing around . it ' s wonderful being somewhere people are enjoying themselves , but this is a little much . . . my most favorite part of the meal was the crispy pig trotter , easily , possessing approximately one million layers of sumptuousness and amazingness delectable piquant crunchy creamy . my least favorite part of the meal was the black label burger , which was just okay , because there was absolutely no sear on the meat , and it could have used a bit more salt -- however , the brioche and the fries were fantastic . . . the cocktails were consistently superb , although expensive , but very much worth it . our waitress wasn ' t very welcoming , nor very patient . although we both knew exactly what we wanted , having read dozens of reviews and seeing hundreds of pictures , we were very prepared , but she couldn ' t be bothered , seeming entirely disinterested . really , her presence was bothersome , she acted so unpleasantly not just to us but to the tables around us as well . nobody was being loud or obnoxious , she was just rude . we ordered the black label burger , oxtail and foie gras terrine , crispy pig trotter , and roasted bone marrow . this should have been an absolutely foolproof meal , but the main obstruction was our waitress ' stubbornness and lack of consideration . we asked that each course be delivered individually , because we wanted to take our time and enjoy ourselves , but she insisted on removing things before we were finished , and she demanded on bringing additional items before we were actually ready for them . thankfully , however , the doorman was nice , the hostess and manager were friendly , the bartenders were very attentive , and the bus-boys were all very kind and generous . 
i agree with the other reviews . this place is disgusting and it seems the employees don ' t have a clue what they ' re doing . the place is confusing . . . is it a bar ? a restaurant ? a buffet ? maybe the people who own this should pick one and try to clean the place up . my table tried the " famous wings " . we too experienced cold middles and they were soggy . after looking around at how filthy the place is , i ' m surprised we didn ' t get sick . do yourself a favor peeps , go to mcdonalds ! 
horrible customer service ! i tried to put in a reservation and then hostess put me on hold which sounded like they were transfering me to a line that kept ringing and ringing . when i had called back the second time and told the hostess about this in a very curious manner she had the audacity to hang up on me ! i don ' t know how some people managed to still be employed with that kind of behavior ! blah . 
went last night and it was delicious . please know this is mostly a pizza and salad place . the only pastas are lasagnas . i think the menu could use some protein options . ambience is amazing . . . so romantic . ordered the lasagna bolognese and a calzone and both were great ! i love the wine list has a lot of wine choices for any budget . service was so wonderful . i will be back ! 
while the atmosphere was great , the food was less than desirable . the fish taco was almost raw and the condiments were too hot . the drinks were watered-down . it ' s a shame as i really enjoyed the lay out , bar , etc . unfortunately , when you go to eat , you go mainly for the food , and it was not good at all . 
its a small tiny little shop , so make sure to come earlier or make a reservation . the place servers good food at very good prices , lots of the food can be shared . i got the sano panini and it was very nice and light . i also ordered the pear juice , that was just blended up pears and it tasted almost fermented like . . . i didn ' t care for the juice . i ' d recommend coming in a small group , we came in a group of N and it was a really tight squeeze . 
great place , very good food , lovely room , attentive , friendly staff from front door to dining room to exit . i strongly recommend trattoria dell ' arte . we enjoyed the excellent pasta pizza wine service . 
best hell kitchen clinton burrito . delicious salsa . slightly rundown , but that ' s part of the experience . 
came here for my friends birthday and had to be rolled out ! ! ! we had the family style meal and it was amazing ! ! i was a hot mess eating the meatballs and sausage but i didn ' t care . my favorites -their pizza is amazing here ! the vodka sauce pizza was my favorite -pappardelle pasta with sausage -house salad ( so good ) 
the best hot and cold sandwiches around ! ! ! and the price can ' t be beat ! their breakfast sandwiches are made fresh to order and loaded with eggs , meat and cheeses for such a low price . their lunch sandwiches , hot or cold , i can make two meals out of them or share with a co-worker . you certainly can ' t get a lb of fresh meat on a sandwich any other place for N or N bucks . the salad bar is the freshest i have ever seen with so much variety to offer ! a must go and eat ! ! ! ! 
what a great fun and unique dining experience . no night will ever be the same ! enjoy ! 
stopped by last night and was pleasantly surprised . enthusiastic and energetic staff , great tapas ( serrano ham croquettes and garlic butter frog ' s legs . . hmmm ) . they ' re still waiting on their liquor license , but eagerly offered house wine . warm , clean , and attitude free . i ' m looking forward to going back for a full meal . an after dinner stroll through the cobblestone seaport ends the evening perfectly - nice place for a date . 
great place for fantastic food . they have a ton of great choices to choose from and the food i got was super good . i just got a burger , but man what a great burger it was . it was cooked to perfection and was exactly what i wanted . friendly and fun place . 
great location and pleasant staff with broad menu . food was good but a little on the pricey side for quality and portion . " 
horrible service . asked them to fax their specials menu N times and they never did . was on hold waiting to place my order for N minutes and then they just hung up . used to be quality food . now just sloppy and rude . 
last stop on the philly uye and all we had was a beer . i ' ve been to the rooster for dinner before , though it was good . i don ' t remember what i had , but i know that its atmosphere is distinctly different from that of every other establishment i ' ve been to in the city . perhaps it ' s just an older crowd . i like it , though it ' s very pleasant . the service could have been better . 
tried a range of tapas . . . pan tumaca , churrasco arriero , croquetas de jamon , empanadillas de carne , pimientos de piquillo rellenos . . . . they were ok , but nothing that i ' m craving to have again . red wine sangria was ok , not awesome . 
so i was traveling down the new jersey turnpike , and has a sudden hankering for ice cream . this was convenient to the turnpike , so i decided to give them a try based on yelp reviews . . . . ok , i ' ll stop here . i ' m lying . this place isn ' t really that convenient to the turnpike , though it isn ' t far . it ' s more of a garden state parkway convenience . and this is one of those times that i didn ' t even bother to check the yelp reviews . i ' m a sopranos fan geek ! really , i ' ve been wanting to come here for N years just to see the booth . and i did . and it was a hell of a lot of fun to me , especially since the booth was empty when i got there and i could take my fan geek picture in the booth freely . yay me ! while i was here , i tried a milkshake . i enjoyed it very much . since they had banana as a specialty flavor , i had an opportunity to get a chocolate banana milkshake which i love . and my wife , who rolled her eyes at my fan geekiness several times , highly enjoyed her dish of mint chocolate chip . i don ' t know about the regular food here , but if i lived up here i ' d think nothing of coming here to sit at the counter and down a malt . i loved the overall classic look of this joint . over N bucks total for the shake and the small dish of ice cream . maybe slightly pricey for what you get . but the booth pic was worth it . 
in the mood for some roti canai , i ran over for dinner after a great yelp event at nolita mart . i looked like an idiot walking with a friend over to the restaurant because it was mysteriously closed down . however , a kind pedestrian saw us staring at the sign confused and kindly pointed out that the restaurant was actually right across the street . awkward . the roti canai is obviously a must order appetizer . it does not come with much so if you are a huge fan , order one for each person . the chow keuh teow is stir fried noodles with shrimp and the waitress commented that it was her favorite . the dish was a bit greasy for me , but really good otherwise and a big portion . i definitely will be returning to grab a cheap meal and get a bit more ambitious with the menu . 
great drinks ! crowded little place that has it ' s own unique character . 
why oh why do you mess around with the patata brava ? it is unrecognizable with that heavy pepper ' chutney-like ' sauce over fingering potatoes . i appreciate reinterpretations but not when you transform it into something completely different and have none of the merits of this classic tapas . it ' s like messing with french fries and screwing it up . . . none of the other fancy tapas we ordered really made an impression . everything just seemed so complicated . . . i ' m tired just thinking about it . 
one of my fav byo sushi spot in the city ! only has a few tables so make a rezzi . 
pros good sushi , decent prices , cute ambiance , great value for lunch cons ? the sushi here is fresh , tasty , reasonably priced , and decently portioned --- an unbeatable combo . we came here for lunch and got the salmon bento box and a dragon roll . both were above average in taste and quality . kidari is definitely one of the better sushi spots , especially if you happen to be in this area of town . 
last time i went to the memphis taproom it was mystery beer weekend , i drank beers i didn ' t like and didn ' t know the names of . i was excited to head back and see what their regular beer list was like , but when i went back and it was german beer weekend . this place loves drinking games . i had great food and great service , but had to order a bottled beer , cause i ' m just not that into german beer . i want my beer to be black . i want it to come out of a tap . year round . went back again for brunch and there was finally a stout on draught ! egg in a nest with roasted mushrooms and an imperial stout make for a good morning . hopefully they have a festive stouts weekend sometime soon ! 
dumplings were great . very juicy and flavorful . ordered the steamed buns , but they were not as great . a bit chewy and too doughy . will be back for the dumplings again . 
it ' s so much fun to go here with friends . i love the everything but the kitchen sink salad . i recommend the classic beef meatballs and tomato sauce . my friends usually order the other ones and they ' re also great ! would get N stars if there wasn ' t such a long wait every time ! 
yes , their corn is the best yummy mess you can ever eat ! and their cuban sandwich really is the best there is in nyc . but what else i really like ? their imported sodas ! try the guava or the tamarind . 
it seems every time i am in soho to shop i have to come to eat here . i simply love it ! i will not venture to try anything else period . which drives my husband even more crazy than my spending habits . we ' ve had breakfast , lunch and dinner here and always enjoy it . the only con is it ' s hard to get in , you need to make reservations well in advance , but you won ' t be disappointed . there is also a bakery next door that has pastries and sandwiches that also gets very busy but worth the wait . if you ' re in soho it ' s worth a stop . 
i love their dandan noodles and cold sesame noodles ! 
while joining two friends for lunch today , i was very disappointed in my lunch at holsten ' s . i have patronized this establishment for over N years , and today was the worst . after being seated , we ordered our selections . i chose a very simple hamburger which certainly did not taste like it should . . . a very thin patty with two tiny pickle slices . i also ordered an iced tea , which was served with a lemon wedge . i did not ask for the black spots on the lemon however ! not wanting to make my friends feel uneasy , i chose not to mention it to the server . in hindsight , i should have . it is unfortunate that this negative experience will no longer find me going to , or recommending holsten ' s . 
i asked for recommendations from some of my neighbors and several people recommended this place . generally i prefer vietnamese , thai , or cambodian cuisine to chinese but my N year old really wanted some sesame chicken , so chinese it was . upon arrival , the tiny dining room was pleasantly a buzz with activity . the decor was simple but cozy and cheerful and everything smelled marvelous . t we ordered N entrees and N appetizers for our first time ordering from this neighborhood hot spot . the cumin lamb was great . the sesame chicken was really just general tsao ' s chicken with sesame seeds sprinkled on top and the chicken lo mein was good with noodles that were fresh and springy and the chicken was tender . the apps were not a success pork spring rolls were very grease-soaked and tough , steamed dumplings had a thick rubbery dough with tasteless filling and crab rangoon was pretty much all cream cheese with no discernible crab and it also had a thick , tough dough shell . we didn ' t finish the rangoon and dumplings and thew a few out . that never happens . we ordered online and the promotion wasn ' t honored at pick up free chicken fried rice with a N order . so , kind of a mixed bag . 
i ' m all about preparation . got the seats at the prep counter and watched the japanese head chef dish out individual designer sushis to a japanese couple in front of him . the presentation and choice of fish made my mouth water . when my sashimi platter came , i could tell some of the variety ( maybe all ) had been previously frozen and the hamachi lost a bit of flavor . still good for typical ny sashimi standards ( no freezer burn of course ) . their tempura came with green tea salt , wasabi salt and some other fancy ingredient i can ' t remember . the flavors and textures were good . pleasant wait staff , good dining experience . 
excellent personal service and eclectic menu . cocktails were well mixed and not too sweet . entrees perfectly balanced and evocative of the season . 
our holiday party was great here ! the food was excellent , drinks were even better . the service was awesome . i would certainly come back for drinks with friends plan another corporate party event here . norman and hannah were the best ! 
first of all , i ' ve been coming here on and off for a couple of years . their cooked lunch specials are good value and tasty ( i like the katsu ) . but the other day i went in and ordered a sushi lunch ( N rolls ) and it was really horrific . i mean , some of the worst sushi ever . dry rice , roll falling apart , overly fishy-tasting ( ie not fresh ) fish , small . it really turned me off and i didn ' t finish it - it was just gross to eat . i ' ve had one or two good rolls here at dinnertime , as well as some not-so-great ones . occasionally the fish just does not taste fresh by any stretch . but really , the meal the other day put me over the edge and meant i won ' t be coming back here , at least for awhile - especially with sakura express in the neighborhood ( huge amt of fish in each roll , really great value - just wish they were open later for lunch ) . the people that run it seem nice , just wish the quality was more consistent . i would definitely go with their cooked food if you ' re going . 
flavors were fine . waitress was rushed but friendly . pulled pork sandwich was flavorful and a good deal for the price . dumplings were overcooked and short ribs were burnt and fatty . won ' t be back . 
i love this place . very cozy and not too much crowded and narrow . and server is so kind . you can get nice service at there . and salmon egg benedict is amazing . delicious ! i just want to go there only for it even though i don ' t like salmon very much . it is not salty but clean and light taste . instead of salmon , sauces and spinach ( i ' m not sure what is it ) be well seasoned so it balanced very well ! and they made real fresh fruit juice , i recommend it also . but coconut pancake is not very good . i can ' t recommend it . it made us thirsty . without it , everything is perfect . 
i am officially a fan ! - the drive to this place was a bit hectic but when i finally arrived i was amazed by the organization at the front counter . they provide a number for all orders and call out when its ready . order was ready in N mins flat ! . feel the need to comment on decor - small but spacious enough for a comfortable quick bite . not a N-star but sufficient . the garbage mentioned in other reviews is just nit picking - its as clean as a garbage area can be . did not see any flies either . now back to my order of N pan-fried dumplings with a beef noodle soup . the dumplings are large and filled with extra meat for that full bite . they hold together well oppose to others where the meat falls out on the first bite . the even held their crunch after the N min ride back home . beef soup - nice chewy but not soggy noodles . beef was a bit fatty but taste great ! overall , i am a fan and will be back to cure the my next dumpling craving . 
love ! it ' s less crowded than little skips and there ' s a really pretty back patio . the lappi is so effing good . nice place to grab breakfast lunch study work . . . your usual coffee scene . the people that work there have always been super pleasant too- even when it ' s busier on weekends . 
omg ! ! ! if i lived in greenwich village , i would eat there every night ! ! the bread sticks are to die for . i wish they were opened on sundays . excellent gf pizza and excellent italian food . we went there as a family and everyone loved their meal . small cozy place . 
fabulous lunch today . the pulled pork is out of this world . the atmosphere is so relaxing and service is superb . i had my N , N and N month old with me and they even made them a grilled cheese . 
my last review was push down to the bottom because yelp policies of rating . that ' s why i ' m writing again to tell my experience in this awesome place , if you are a lover of traditional italian food or just homemade food you will be in heaven , besides you will have a great experience , service is great and always on point . our favorite person there is jose , he is so approachable and always have the right advice for you . just two words for you try it . 
i was walking to grocery store one afternoon when i came across this lovely place . i was very pleased with the rotisserie chicken , the meat was so juicy and the herbs were delicious . we had the kale mashed potatoes and creamy cauliflower , both equally good . and the carrot cake was the best carrot cake next to my grandmothers carrot cake . so moist and fluffy yumm ! ! ! my mouth is watering now . a must for lunch or dinner ! or if you need a quick dinner on way home for your family . the workers were all very friendly and helpful . will be going back , for sure ! 
one word overrated ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! grrr ! i ' ve been here a couple of times but it was when it just opened . my experiences in the past here service wise and food wise left me unimpressed with the place , so i wrote it off . i went here yesterday for brunch totally just cuz it was one of the very few places open for brunch . ugh , i should ' ve known better but , my outta town visitor was starving and outta lack of choices , i went against my will . we waited for about N minutes to be seated ( N of us ) . once we were seated , we were left with our menus for over N minutes ! it was mad busy there and so my friends and i were patient but geez , after watching N server ' s walk by our table without even some sorta acknowledgement , our patience dissipated ! i had to inquire twice about our server before the guy came around ( note he was one of the server ' s who passed our table a few times ! ) to give a half-assed apology to us . we ordered the following me- lox bagel friend N- steak and home potatos friend N- omelete w mushrooms friend N- N eggs over easy and home fries friend N- crab cakes friend N- croisstant french toast pretty simple right ? not ! my lox and bagel was oh soooo bad ! i got N pathetic slices of salmon over a bed of dead lettuce and my bagel was burnt soooo bad it was unedible ! my one friend who ordered the omelete with mushrooms ? umm , it came with no mushrooms . . . the other ' s orders were just " ok " which at that point was more than we could ask for . . . . not only that , we all ordered coffee cappuchino ' s . we asked for sugar and when the server gave us sugar ? almost all the packets were either half open or had some sorta nasty fungus on it ! ewwww ! seriously peoples , how difficult is it to make some very simple american breakfast dishes ? i understand it was xmas day and xtra busy cuz it ' s one of the few places open for brunch and they were short staffed but . . . . it ' s absolutely inexcuseable how pathetic and lacking both the service and food was ! i would give it minus stars if there was this option . . . . . 
i may need a drug-eluting coronary stent soon . . . after eating one of pat ' s flavorless cheesesteaks . . . . i went there as a " tourist " to try an " original " philadelphia cheesesteak . . . not impressed . . . the meat tasted just like a white castle beef burger . . . . ( so yeah , if you like white castle then you will like pat ' s ! ) . . . heartburn for daaaaays . i chose the cheesesteak " wit " provolone , mushrooms , and onions . . ugh . the bread was a toughy italian bread if you wear dentures do not try taking a bite ! ! the joint across the street was much better . . . you will know what i mean if you have been there . ) 
amazing service and food in such a central location . perfect leading up to a broadway show or if you want somewhere quiet to eat away from the madness of midtown . be aware - they don ' t serve any alcohol but ( for now ) byo is free . 
i have been a customer for over N and N N years of this establishment , and it has taken me this long to write this review to warn others of this place . in the beginning , the food was amazing , but the service was always terrible ! the manager ' s never care when you bring complaints to their attention , and they always exclaim , we promise to make it better next time . i ' m not looking for a comp , i just want them to care , but it is so obvious they do not care ! ! ! . the servers and hostesses who take orders screw up so many times it ' s unbelievable , and there are no systems in place to correct . i can remember on one hand the times i actually had a positive service experience with this place ! i own my own small business in nyc , and if i treated my clients that way , i would be out of business within months . but . . . i would always come back for the food which my wife loved . but now . . . please read . this place is horrendous . last month , i went in for take out and saw one of the regulari sushi chefs in the bathroom . he never washed his hands after using the toilet , brushed his hands through his hair , and left . . . . i was mortified . two weeks ago , i got sick , bad food poisoning . . . the worst N hours of my life from this place . when i called it to there attention of the manager ' s , they balked . . . did nothing and now it my crusade to tell everone . it is a big hangout on weekends so please proceed with caution on every front with this place . there are too many great places out there to deal with the crap of sushi lounge ! 
love their special rolls . washington , blue crab roll , and their inferno roll is amazing . they also sell uni ! ! i found my go to sushi spot in philly . 
this is the place that popped my cheesesteak cherry and i ' m glad it did . i had never had a cheesesteak before i came to this place and i was curious about how a cheesesteak actually tasted . i came to this place instead of jim ' s because of some reviews i have read on here . i ' m glad i came to this place and not any of those tourist traps . the meat here is seasoned just right and the whiz is pretty good even though i kind of hate cheese . the service is pretty amazing too . other cheesesteak places just do not compare
N thumbs up , the pizza is the bombbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb . 
went here with my new roomie and fell in love with the tasty balls ! i even got my mom to go twice in one week . i will be taking all of my visitors here and suggesting it to friends . everything but the kitchen sink salad is my favorite . get it with pesto sauce . the combination of meat , veggies and hummus is unbeatable . my new guilty pleasure . the white peach sangria is to die for and you ' ll definitely want more than a glass . there is truly something for everyone , even vegans . the atmosphere is equally as great . unfortunately , it faces a bikram studio which serves as a reminder to sweat my ( meat ) balls off after din . 
this restaurant is really great . fantastic tacos . once i has the fish tacos ( very fresh and light with lots of flavor ) and once i had the pork tacos ( also flavorful and more filling then the fish tacos ) . we shared a steak quesadilla as an app , which was ok . drinks were really good with lots of alcohol . our server was very attentive and very friendly . 
i was truly disappointed by my experience here . the ambiance was lovely , the service was stellar , but the food was mediocre at best . i was appalled at how they managed to ruin some amazing ingredients . the halibut we ordered was unevenly cooked - one piece was undercooked , the other was overcooked and mushy . we left the oxtail stuffed artichoke ( two of my favorite foods ) on the plate as it was overcooked and chewy . the " slow cooked " pork belly on one dish was hard and chewy . the lobster was unevenly done . we were so disappointed that we didn ' t even stay for desserts , which says a lot if you know me . i would recommend waiting awhile to visit to see if the kitchen can sort itself out . if you go , sit outside in the garden and only order appetizers ( the stugeon rillete was good ) or some cheese with a bottle of wine . 
i want to know when my last day on this earth will be . i want to know because i want to have breakfast at jefferson ' s on that day . i ' ll order the fried catfish with grits and biscuits as my last meal . i may need to add in a short stack and some french toast as well . and some home fries . maybe some chicken and waffles . . . i need to do this just in case heaven don ' t have a jefferson ' s . or hell for that matter . lulz . after coming here N times so far i feel a strong loyalty building . a breakfast place to be for those special days . like my birthday . or waking up with someone new that i don ' t feel bad about . lololo . . . o . o i ' m all in when it comes to the catfish , grits and biscuits plate . fuhgedaboudit . i like to take the biscuits and make little sammiches of the catfish , covering it in grits , dabbing a li ' l hot sauce , and adding some grape jelly for that piece a la rayzistaunce . this place is a no frills , hole in the wall , mom and pop ( pop jefferson ) spot . i say that with respect . the focus is on the food , and it is great down-home , southern-fried eatin ' . the place is small , so if you come in and all the seats are filled except for one table that just hasn ' t been cleared yet , do yourself a favor and go take that table . not now but right now . if you don ' t , someone else will . i ' ve only been here for breakfast , and there are still so many things on just that menu that i want need to experience . and oh i plan to . oh , and you ' ll very likely see mr . jefferson ( he ' s the one in the pics with the floating biscuits as you enter ) pop out from the back every once in a while . very nice guy . and he ' ll start to remember you after a few visits and say hi and maybe spark up a li ' l convo when he sees you . nice little touch of that southern hospitality . in north jersey . fyi jefferson ' s is cash only . 
eh nothing special . ribs taste like a smoked ham . wish i could shave them and make a ham and cheese on white bread . sandwiches ok . good service but dfntly some better tasting bbq in town
i ' ve been going here for about N years . the food an service are always outstanding . the salads are huge and everyone will find something they like . 
ramen broth is authentic , but over priced at N a bowl . hirata buns pork or chicken , is a taiwanese dish call gua bao . you don ' t charge ppl N for that small thing . . . . . yelp . com biz baohaus-new 
i have to give jose pistola ' s the credit it ' s due after a befuddled friend of mine didn ' t know how they were able to get the sought after pliny the elder on tap . here ' s the scoop yes , it might be on oddly laid out mexican joint sports bar sharing the street with establishments like mcglinchey ' s , fox and hound and applebee ' s but don ' t hold that against them . no , they ' re not the hot date spot to take your fancy new lady but they are one hell of a place to celebrate a phillies post season win . it ' s the place you go to meet for happy hour , to watch a sports game or to hang out with friends and order some good food and relax . the nachos , as previously reviewed , are out of this world . the half portion proved to be enough for two people as a full on meal . all of the food here is very good , and not in the way people call mexican food good . it ' s actually full of flavor , not just a catalyst for sour cream , cheese and beans . the guac is fresh and delicious , the meats are perfectly seasoned . they have daily specials so take note when you stop in . last let ' s talk beer . jose pistola ' s hasn ' t been getting the clout on the beer scene that hawthorne ' s or even misconduct do . their rotating draft list is world class , this being proven by their tapping a pliny recently . the bottle selection is extensive but unpretentious . in a city full of beer snobs this place can pull their weight . 
delicious ! beer selection was superb , food was delicious-so tasty and fresh ! our server was friendly and helpful . price is right , and the food leaves nothing to be desired . atmosphere is casual and cozy , and rumor has it this place used to be a mcdonald ' s ! this is vermont ! 
well , i ' ve never been here , but , i recently had the pleasure of sampling a few small flaky crusted custard pies and a bite of a muffin - which were phenomenal ! tastes like home cookin ! 
the first pizza i ordered was great but something has changed . not only was the pizza not as good as the first but the delivery person did not have any change on him at all so i paid N . N for a N . N pizza . yes theirs only a N . N difference but i live literally N minutes down the road and that doesn ' t constitute a N . N tip . 
i really love this restaurant ! excellent service and great italian food ! a must ! ) 
they used to have a tuscan lobster roll on the menu which was lobster meat , olive oil and basil . they no longer serve it . in terms of pricing for a food truck ? ? all of those justifying the price , remember lobster is now bought in bulk between N- N a pound . N for one of their rolls is literally highway robbery . ask them to negotiate down on a good day when no one is around you and you can get one for N ! still stupid inflated " N ' s lobster pricing . " 
best pizza in philly . thin crispy crust , fresh toppings and sauce , just like you get it in italy . great pasta too . i ' ve been going here since i was a kid and it opened and it doesnt get any better than this . dont be fooled by the location and not so fancy looking front . this place is amazing . 
this is the best place for a date . the surroundings are beautiful , the food is delicious , huge selection of great wine and cocktails . this combination will make any date go well . usually very very crowded and the place becomes cramped . the service is very friendly , i give them N starts for that . its very important to me . the food is great , i tried the rabbit pot pie , and the lentils here . the taste of almost every dish makes up for it ' s small size . the proportions here are bit tiny for my taste . today i was very hungry and the " small plate " did not fill me up . ended up finishing all the bread ) feed me more buverte ! ! 
i went to this place last week for the N rd time , and again it was great , however i have to say that the ambience was not as nice as the first N times . i think because i went on a friday night and it was really noisy and busy . but all of the points in my previous review , still hold true . just one note directed los x ( on his review ) to say that you obviously are not familiar with portuguese culture would be an understatement . the olives you see on the table are not from pathmark , they are bought in bulk from suppliers and the smaller black ones are imported from portugal . portuguese don ' t eat warm bread , so if you are going to a portuguese restaurant , expect things to be portuguese style . this is a mediterranean culture , so expect olive oil and garlic to be present in a lot of the dishes . if you dont like that , i guess it might not be for you . finally , portuguese is not a hispanic culture , but i ' m sure we wouldn ' t expect you to know that either . 
went for the west indies parade this labor day and my gf suggested checking out this place . . . to see if they were open serving food instead of buying off the random stalls on the parade trail . and we got there as they were just setting up . they had oxtail stew- meaty and delicious , not too salty or spicy curry goat - soft , a little gamey-smelling but i still enjoyed it jerk chicken - done well , not too spicy for me bread pudding - N per serving ( parade prices ) curry chicken stew chicken they didn ' t have shrimp for the parade , but my girlfriend said that ' s what she always gets when she ' s there . i got rice and beans , vegetables , oxtail stew and goat . . . all for N ( cash during the parade ) . . . and that fed N people ! ) i will definitely be coming back next time . . . and i am getting the bread pudding next time for sure ! tip-bits right off the corner of washington and eastern parkway i ' ve been told the rum cake . . . made my friend sleep for N hours straight free delivery catering available
linguini is handmade , portions are big , service and food are good . food took a while to come , but that ' s okay . seafood dishes are very pricey but there are def cheaper options -- there is a wide price range in their menu . oh , and their pizza bread is delicious ! apparently ( handmade ) black ravioli is available every once in a while , but on no set schedule . i definitely want to come back and try that out ! 
you ' re saying i can smoke on the back patio while having my delish burger at a good price ? the perfect sized burger made me satisfied without oding . royale , i wish i could hug you . 
really cute store-front , beautiful lighting and bar . . . and best of all lovely food and drink served by lovely people . 
a great place ! ! food is just amazing and the owners are very friendly . fyi this place is byo
great place . . . liked the food , a bit expensive but then again what food in a nice restaurant in new york isnt ? had the chicken and waffles , just because i ' ve never tried it before . it was good
cracked pepper turkey sandwich is awesome . service is slow but worth the waiting time
first of all , the excitement this place gives me when i walk in the door is like a kid in a candy shop . its like a mall of beer , cider beers are my favorite and there is a whole fridge just devoted to them ! all different kinds , and while i enjoy trying new ones , there are always my originals available as well . mix and match with a N discount on a N-pack . . . sweet , i know . the food is also a major plus here , i love the braised beef sandwich on a pretzel bun-so delish . i ' m truly happy this is a new establishment in the city , definitely recommend checking it out . 
perfect place to grab breakfast or lunch . i went here with a friend and everything we ordered was delicious . the staff is very friendly and welcoming , i would definitely go back . 
came in around N pm and was lucky to get a table without a wait . the crowd was mainly businessmen on their lunch breaks so the atmosphere wasn ' t loud or crazy . the music wasn ' t what you ' d think in a meatball place , death cab for cutie was playing . i had the beef meatball with the classic tomato sauce . the meat had almost a sweet flavor like sausage . the order comes with N small meatballs which was more filling then it looked . for dessert you can combine your choice of cookie and ice cream for home made ice cream sandwiches . after dessert you will leave here full ! 
this place is , the jam . open N hours , with attentive service and delicious authentic food . and the prices are good . we ordered the chipotle chocolate chicken wings , the mexican hot chocolate , the fish tacos , and the guac ( always appreciate a plantain chip ) . there are N tiny fish tacos for about N bucks which is a drag , but they have the fixings to boot . don ' t expect huge chicken wings . also , there are maybe N in an order . you can always stay drinking all night ! if you speak spanish like one of my compadres , you may even score some free drinks ) haven ' t tried a main dish het , but surely will in the near near future . overall , a place with some serious heart . go to donut pub next door for dessert ! hell , go next door to get a coffee and a cinnamon crueler and go to work ! ! ! ! 
i love this place . i ' m afraid to try other places because i ' m afraid they won ' t be as good . i love the murg dansik ! lots of good chicken chunks and no weird gelatinous pieces . 
i walked about a mile and half to this spot to try a cheesesteak after reading multimple reviews and an article from N from philadelphia magazine naming it the best in the city . i had been to philly a number of times and had enjoyed all the cheesesteaks i had eaten , so i was pretty confident that i would not be blown away . . . but man are their sandwiches awesome . dude was a bit gruff and prolly didnt feel the yankees hat i was wearing , but i really appreciated the feel of a neighborhood deli , with mad people coming in and out to pickup their orders . it was so good i came back N days later to scoop another one before heading back to the city . i will definitely make a stop here next time i ' m in philly and will follow my instincts and order two . 
great walk-in cuban food . pretty greasy , but sometimes you want your empanadas that way - which by the way are to die for . absolutely addicting . every flavor . i wish i could comment on more dishes , but i ' ve never wanted to stray from the empanadas . 
i go every brunch i can , rachael the bartender is awesome , she really know how to take care ppl there ( dont seat at the tables ) 
you gotta love that this place is called simply rita and joes . it ' s not a restaurant it ' s like you ' ve been invited over your neighbor ' s for a great meal . the name is so free of pretense--just like the place itself and that is why almost everyone likes it . the food is the absolute baseline of what solid new jersey new york classic italian american cuisine is . it ' s not the most inventive menu , and maybe the waitstaff is not up to some snooty yelpers ' standards . but let them go to manhattan and dine with the other people from ohio and california who want to tell their friends back home all about the great italian meal they got in new york . i ' ll be over at rita and joes , having a delicious plate of manicotti smothered in gravy and cheese , with fresh bread and maybe a nice sambuca to finish off the meal . and i ' ll be soaking in all the character this place has to offer , as well as the characters that it seems to attract . classic jersey . 
i have been here once and loved it . it ' s cute , traditional and charming . their menus are handwritten which adds a nice touch . i ordered the spinach gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce . one of the best gnocchi i ever had . it ' s light but at the same time so divine . the gorgonzola sauce isn ' t strongly flavored with gorgonzola . i ' m actually not a fan of blue cheese or gorgonzola but this sauce is mild . i would not have known it was gorgonzola from the taste . definitely a great place to try ! 
this is the best place for cuban food . i usually try to get there before twelve to get a table . the place is very small and very uncomfortable but the food is fantastic . everything i have is delicious including the cuban sandwich , chicken diablo sandwich , fish taco and the corn . 
i went here once , recently , for a celebratory dinner , and i have to say , i really like this place . my only gripe is that it ' s too expensive for me to eat there on a normal basis , but that ' s only because i ' m a poor grad student and i can ' t afford to go out to eat most places . . . anyway , osteria is a classy restaurant , is totally gorgeous inside , and the owners are among the brave pioneers trying to revive n . broad street . the place even has a sommelier , who is very nice and seemed very attentive to the people who could actually afford wine . i contented myself with my favorite beer - duchesse du burgogne , a flemish sour which i was surprised they had . they have a decent beer selection , and the wine selection is , of course , really good . aside from cool decor and upscale ambiance , the food was fantastic . my boyfriend and i split a pizza as an appetizer , which was thin and crispy like pizzas are made in italy . it had cheese on it with fresh arugula and prosciuto - delicious ! next came the main course . i got oven-baked skate with crispy capers and parsnip puree . i had never had skate before , and it was amazing ! it ' s a flaky white fish ( resembling a small stingray when it ' s alive ) , and osteria cooked it to perfection . i ' d definitely eat that again . my boyfriend got lamb , which was also very good , but i liked the skate better . last came dessert - a little molten chocolate cake with pistacchio gelato . yum . if i had money , i ' d eat here all the time ( and not only because it ' s about a block from my apartment ) . i could live off their pizza , which is heads and shoulders above normal pizza . if i were a business person , i ' d definitely take clients here . a in my book . 
the food is incredible especially the chicken meatballs . however there is always a wait and the guy that is the seating host is not polite at all . i had a party of N and my friend wasn ' t going to eat just i was and he wouldn ' t seat us till she got here . boooo ! 
loved this place ! cannot say enough about it ! the food was delicious and the staff and service were incredible . we had the stuffed mushrooms special for an appetizer and split the scallops and ricciatelle for our main course . the drinks were delicious , the crowd was upbeat , and every single person that worked there was extremely friendly and made you feel like they appreciated your dining there . we will definitely be returning , a new favorite ! 
also ordered the sinfonia di pasta . as it was our first visit , and our waiter neglected to mention the refill policy ( nor did i read it on the menu nor did my homework on yelp ) i wasn ' t anticipating my bottomless plate . we weren ' t starved , and we ' re currently all being careful about overeating . one friend ordered a chicken ( picatta style ) main dish , the other had a large house salad as her entree . the portions were generous , but even if they weren ' t we would eat family style . when the caesar salad for two was served we wanted our friend , who ordered a large spring salad as an entree , to taste some of ours . not only did we get a disparaging look from the server , but after the three way split the remaining salad was whisked away from our table without our being asked if we wanted to finish the remaining salad on the serving plate . a single ravioli from my sinfonia was given to both of my friends to try . when shared with my friend who had only ordered salad , the waiter approached her and said cameras were in the room and that sharing the sinfonia wasn ' t allowed . we weren ' t looking for a deal by not ordering a third main entree , and we were not looking to abuse their refill policy . the remark was rude and we felt uncomfortable for the rest of the meal . by the way , the sinfona was decent , not the best ravioli or home made pasta by a long shot . the bread selection , olive oil and free chickpea appetizer were very good and the house wine by the glass ( cheapest one on the menu - N ) was excellent . the chicken portion was enormous , we took home leftovers . not running back , even though we go to the theatre often . i don ' t want to be watched as i eat nor do i want anyone telling me , large portions or small , when to share my food . the food is of a high caliber , but the management needs an attitude adjustment . i find it hard to believe that lidia b . wouldn ' t want us all to sample the inspired delights from this restaurant ' s kitchen . 
i honestly have a serious case of regret . so much so that i want to come back again and give it a different score ( i think ) . instead of ordering the artichoke pizza ( personal size ) and letting my other half get the meatball parm ( also personal size ) , we shared the large sicilian pie . now , don ' t get me wrong , the sicilian was delicious , the sauce was on the sweet side and it wasn ' t super , duper , thick like you expect sicilian to be ( which is a nice change of pace ) . if you want to skip the line and don ' t mind getting a full pie . i would suggest dining-in . there ' s literally little to no wait and the server is super friendly and attentive . 
another tapas fiasco in philadlephia . when are chefs in philadelphia ( i am talking to you jose garces in distrito , tinto , and amada ) will understand that tapas means " various dishes ordered for the table so people can real share not couple of tinny plates so people can only taste and leave hungry " . this is place is another fiasco . we were a part of N and we selected this place because all the fuss created by reviews in the esquire , food amp wine , etc . first , so many rules at the time you order that kills the reason of going out for dinner relax and enjoy a night without stress . if you want that , avoid zahav . there are three ways to order in zahav N . a pre fix menu that is N per person N . a feast of all main dishes for N per person N . or , individual plates . the rule is the entire table has to order the same , i mean either everyone get one of the prefixes listed above or individual dishes . so , you are there in the relaxing mode and suddenly you have to stop your conversation so the entire table can make a decision . when the food arrives , the server just put them all over the table regardless who ordered . the food is decent but once again , you will see yourself paying close to N- N per couple and you will leave the place thinking where did you money go . service was awful we had this cranky , rude girl who was horrible . the wine list just over the ordinary same as the dessert list . zahav is another tapas fiasco in philadelphia . 
i had the pleasure of having dinner with a friend at jesse ' s restaurant and tavern . we chose to sit at the bar . a very inviting atmosphere , great service , and delicious food . sarah , the bartender , and fellow staff members went above and beyond to meet our every need . a very enjoyable experience and certainly will be back . 
review is for happy-hour only . this is the absolute best happy hour for food in the city . no other place even comes close really . the food is amazing , the prices are ridiculous . pork bahn mi , kim chee fried rice , everythign i had was . . . exciting . i eat out a lot and this place had some of the most exciting flavors i ' ve had anywhere . now you see it ' s not N stars - two reasons here . if their drink menu was even half what the food was i ' d be all over this place , but maybe i just need to try the graffiti bar . and also i was surprised that no one else in here seemed to be happy hour-ing when i was there . as great as the food was the immaculately designed interior wasn ' t particularly inviting for post-work drinks and food when all you want to do is unwind . maybe i just wanted to show my excitement over the food by telling a stranger about it , but felt like if i did someone would roll their eyes or something . 
solid food everytime . food truck at Nrd and spring garden . generous servings . jerk chicken and oxtail dinners are a must . potato salad and collard greens can ' t be beat . 
mediocre , overpriced food . nice ambiance , good location . service was slow . meh . shrug 
although the food is pretty ok , they have absolutely no respect for reservations . not worth bothering for a restaurant that has a N for food on zagat . management is arrogant to boot . just don ' t bother , they aren ' t worth it . 
i love sally ' s apizza , it holds a special place in my heart , and i ' m sad the remaining owners are thinking of selling . between frank pepe ' s and sally ' s , i would pick sally ' s every time . now granted , their service isn ' t the fastest or friendliest , and mozzarella is considered an added topping , but their pizza just tastes better . the best part ? - it ' s the thin crispy charred crust that leaves my fingertips black for a while , thats all flavor baby , and i love it haha . i really hope the family keeps the restaurant . new haven pizza just won ' t be the same without them around . 
mushroom dip is in town and i sure like it . ask for a free sample and no one would say no to you . came back here again with my boyfriend to get the small belgian waffle fries with one dipping . can you guess which one we order this time ? way too many for you to guess and way too many for us to pick so we picked the most common one and it is . . . cheddar cheese . we both like the mushroom dip more but it is ok because there will always be next time to order mushroom dip with their very tasty and delicious fries . how can i say no to fries when i like potatoes too much ? 
an all around great sandwich . . . and now with the addition of bahn mi fries just makes my sandwich even more delicious ! love the fun drink options as well . 
sexy fun bar restaurant i went here N times it had a funny smell like a toilet i am not sure why ? ? cute idea the soaps in the bathroom you can take home wine list was decent ! i may give it another chance
incredibly fast , cheap , and good . got schwarma and baba and both were as good as i ' ve had in the city at that price point . do it . 
the real deal . top N thai in nyc
a decent pizzeria . their pizza is not my favorite however , i do love their chef salads . they ' re big , plentiful , and the house garlic dressing is yummy . good place to go for lunch . 
we are so lucky to have stumbled upon this gem . the atmosphere is relaxed . seating is a little close - i recommend the bar seats . the cloister cocktail is great - i also recommend the morning glory fizz . burgers are great . i recommend the duck fat fries . the wait staff is very knowledgeable and good with recommendations . just loosen your belts and enjoy this mix of comfort food and gourmet . 
this strange old throw-back german-polish deliette probably has the best potato salad , shrimp salad , chicken salad , cole slaw , macaroni salad that you have ever had . it is what they are known for . i would travel N hours to get this stuff-it ' s that good . the sanwiches are quite tasty too-but nothing to drive N hours for . they home cook their turkey , roast beef , pork roast and ham and they are really quite delicious in their own right . you pick you own type of roll and tell them what you want . the home-made take-away fish cakes ( you must fry them yourself ) are really great and a bargain at . N cents a piece . however , the last two batches i bought all fell apart upon cooking in oil and that really , really pissed me off because i buy N dozen at a clip . one last thing , the meatballs are terrible-stay away from them . if you want any type of deli " salad " this is the best place i have found in new jersey . it is well worth the trip to this fast-fading town . 
a perfect place to go after getting a tattoo ! my tattoo artist suggested that i go here , and it was so much fun . great bartender , great food , and they have drink specials that are some of the most unique in the city . 
greatest bang for your buck ! ! ! the best falafels in town ! ! ! the hot sauce is to die for ! ! ! once you have one , you ' ll be craving for more ! ! ! 
my girlfriend and i came here for dinner . delicious food and a very friendly staff . i highly recommend . we look forward to returning for another wonderful meal . 
mmmm , casa mono is really delicious . i had such a great time there - the ambience is great . i called in to get a reservation , but they said the wait was N hours . my friend and i decided to go anyway and we were seated in N minutes . the presentation was unique and the food , although tapas , had a uniqueness to it as well . it ' s on the pricier side but i think it ' s well worth it
wow . i grew taste buds at this place . i love italian food . it doesn ' t have to be fancy , just good . i expected this place to be over my head , culinary-wise . the atmosphere is a little clubby , with incongruous , loud music blaring . but the warm lighting and intimate seating just beg for relaxing conversations over the delicious food . once the food came , either the noise stopped or i was otherwise distracted . we started with the quail and fried cauliflower . i had the bucatini with jalape o and almond pesto . oh . my . god . perfect pasta texture and strong flavors that blended in an unexpected yet perfect way . i will name drop here vetri himself made my pasta . did that make it more delicious ? probably not , but it ' s cool . dessert belgian waffle with hazelnuts , nutella and vanilla ice cream . the waffle was surprisingly light and the whole thing tasted amazing . the menu has a huge number of options , all of which were understandable and non-intimidating . it was hard to decide . you should go to here . i will be returning ! 
great place for delivery ! i made two orders already from there . first time it was N " philly pizza ( very tasty ) , bruschetta was a bit too juicy , penne pomodoro was served with salad and garlic bread and also was really good . today we ordered penne alla vodka ( delicious ) , prosciuitto paninis ( very tasty ) , grilled shimps ( awesome ) and la fourno salad ( huge and full of everything ) ) so , the food was very delicious . honestly , we didnt finish it because all portions are really big . also it was very hot , when it arrived ! delivery tooks about N minutes each time . i would definitely recommend this place . 
very good , will definitely come back and try again . 
c p is a great place to watch the fame . tons of tvs , good beer and buffalo wings . perfect night . 
love love love this place . i am in sales in new jersey and use these guys whenever i can for lunch . always on time , food is amazing ! ! i am addicted to their vodka rigatoni ! you can ' t go wrong with anything here ! i highly recommend them ! 
this place do live up to the hype . the noodles and the fried dumplings are some of the best i ' ve ever tried . the price is cheap - N fried or steamed dumplings for N . the space is really small , cramped with lots of people and can get loud and obnoxious . you can watch and hear the guy pulling and banging the noodles , fresh right next to where you sit . i have to say it is somewhat a good experience . i was satisfy with the meal , the reason i docked a star is mainly because the place is a little grungy . the food is good enough for me to come back at another time . 
i ' ve been eating at su xing for at least N years and was so glad to have some place to go when harmony was sold and went down hill . in all that time i ' ve only ever had one dish that i didn ' t care for . that was the sprial seaweed - which i don ' t think is even on the menu anymore . the food is excellent , plentious and the place is hospital clean . as if that were not enough , the pricing is extremely affordable , especially the lunch specials . they are mostly N before taxes and tip and include soup , side dish , entre and hot tea . i had an attack of panic a couple years back when i came by and it was closed , but was releived to see that they were just expanding into the next building . this is currently , and has been for several years straight , my favorite place to eat in philadelphia . 
what ' s up with all the bad reviews ? ? ? this place is awesome ! loved the pulled pork , mac cheese , wings and banana pudding . try it yourself and be the judge ! 
locanda verde translates to ' green inn ' . this is not my favourite place for brunch , but it ' s okay . i had a latte , poached eggs on a bed of sausage hash with toast and a side of bacon ( very healthy . . . not ! ) . this place is a bit on the pricey side , but the venue is very nice and the service is swift and courteous . i have only ever eaten here at brunch so i can ' t comment on it , but everything looks good quality - the coffee beans are illy . 
me and my wife were staying at the hotel monaco , which is great by the way , and decided to try the red owl tavern . the food was decent but not great . hummus appetizer is a must . we both had steaks and my wife ' s was overcooked and mine was above average but nothing to write home about . drinks were good , try an old fashioned . worth a try . 
fantastic ! one of my favorite places . the food is consistenly great , good wine list , great service and it ' s reasonably priced . their brunches are ok but it ' s their dinners that i keep going back for . a very happy customer ! 
so sad that the owner had to redecorate with tacky , narcissistic pictures and paint over the beautiful mural outside that had brightened the neighborhood character . the food just doesnt make up for it . we wont be back . we used to like to come here all the time . now it just seems narcissistic and tacky . 
nice little local place . food was fresh , service was good . byo is a plus ! worth doing , you will not be disappointed . 
overall just okay food with terrible service . we walked into a fairly crowded and rowdy restaurant . my first impression was that i had walked into someone ' s living room . after we were shown a table the waitress promptly removed the dishes and left us with napkins , forks , and one glass . i found this odd as plates and glasses enough for the two of us would have seemed to make sense . it made me question the cleanliness of the things they left behind . we were given ample time to peruse the menu . and also ample time to twiddle our thumbs waiting for the food . it seemed like only one table was getting food . . . and that table didn ' t even seem to be getting all their dishes at one time . i was mildly amused watching everyone in the restaurant gaze longingly hungrily at each dish that came out . we eventually got our dishes ( came at the same time yay ) . we got the quail and the shrimp and fish curry . i found the quail to be dry and the curry to be heavy on the ginger . the spicy curry had about N shrimp and i didn ' t see any fish so maybe the fish was just used to flavor the curry ? sadly , i enjoyed the seasoned rice that came with the quail the most . one of the worst parts of the meal was that my glass of water was empty several times . there seemed to be N to N ppl working but they kept disappearing into the kitchen ( and coming back out empty handed ) and it was difficult to flag down anyone for a refill . thai food is known to be spicy and this is the first thai place i ' ve been to that wasn ' t attentive . we were lucky we were near the aisle . . . other quests were not as successful getting service . i also noticed what another reviewer said about the owner ( ? ) giving the check and then standing at the table until it was paid . this was a very disappointing experience . perhaps we choose the wrong dishes ( they did seem to have a lot of dishes not traditionally served in other thai restaurants ) but i will not be going back to try anything else since the service was so atrocious . 
i had one outstanding meal here-- a vegetarian sampler that was surprising and inventive , and which included tamales , dahl , squash , and several other sides , which somehow worked beautifully together . unfortunately , i ' ve also waited waaaaay too long for food to come out when i ' ve been here for brunch-- half an hour for eggs in a half-empty restaurant just doesn ' t make sense . there atmosphere also leaves something to be desired-- though the wall of books and canned goods is sweet , there is something very strip-mallish about the giant plate glass window and harsh lighting some good drapery and better lamps would make the cottage aesthetic more consistent . service is solid . 
the quesadilla with guac was heavenly ! ! something about the tortilla makes it so different . and the meat is marinated to perfection ! ! ! ive been to gordos in berkeley , and this place is just as good , if not better ! awesome and fun cheap eat
i was there last night for valentines day . i loved everything about this place . the food was amazing . the decor was great too . not to mention the vibe . everybody was having a great time . this is defenatelly one of my favourite places in lic . highly recommended
i went to firebox on a monday evening - i travel weekly and usually try good food wherever i go . this came highly recommended on yelp . we checked the menu and were looking forward to a good meal . when we got there we found out that they only had a tasting menu on mondays . the food itself was decent - but the service was terrible . being thanksgiving week , the restaurant was really quiet with maybe N tables in total and the service was very slow , the waitress never really checked up on us - took long to take our orders and even longer to get our food . i would not go back and would not recommend it to anyone . 
it ' s sooo good , so as a N born and raised southeast asian , i decided to give this place a go to see if it lives up to its reputation among my friends . i didn ' t expect much of the decor because it ' s an asian restaurant ( fushion restaurants had better designs to attract americans ) . ordered sambal petai , which , if you ' re not familiar with petai ( a type of vegetable found in tropical countries ) , i would suggest you not order it . to some it ' s poison , to others it ' s a delicacy ( but just a little better than shark ' s fin and abalone . . . to me at least ) . anyway , this type of vege was meant to make you fart for the next two days , as well as stink up your mouth and poo . but the spice was perfect , although it tasted like the chef had put too much msg . petai was kinda old too . chicken curry with rice was served very quickly , so i kinda doubt the freshness of it . however , i love the sweet slightly spicy taste of the curry . asked for green chilli and red chilli . the green chilli was too big so it wasn ' t spicy , blachan was not good at all . like a typical malaysian restaurant , do not come here expecting exceptional service . what ' s important was that they were attentive such that they made sure empty dishes were cleaned and tea refilled . i had no problem getting their attention for chillis , drinks and check . overall , this clean restaurant served up good food at a timely manner . worth a try . 
it may have been rainy outside , but snack was cozy , toasty . . . and greek ! i arrived just-in-time to snag a warmly-lit window seat and avoided the dinner rush ! the super-friendly waitress kicked things off with a flight of savory spinach and cheese pies . for my main , the veal meatballs made fast friends with prunes and a red wine reduction . i washed it all down with a cup of honey-spiked tea . i ' ll definitely have to hit this mediterranean oasis again ! ( i ' m curious about the iced , greek coffee . ) 
the worst part about eating here is that you ' ll only have room for one crepe . . . but so many look delicious ! sweet or savory , the choices are amazing . it feels like a truly decadent lunch dinner . the quiet location , the decor and the staff all add up to a place that really reminded me of france . you kind of just want to sit pose around for hours , wearing a beret , arguing about great writers and smoking furiously ( if doing that sort of thing was socially acceptable and didn ' t cause lung cancer ) . the cheap bastard in me had a small heart attack at the price of some of the fillings . i imagine it ' s pretty easy to end up with a N crepe . having said that , everyone knows the best crepe combo ever is butter and brown sugar , so more isn ' t always better in this situation . i would recommend this place for one of those date nights when you ' re really jonesing for an out of this world crepe , or you are trying really hard to get laid by one of those girls that watches foreign films and thinks people are impressed when she drops sartre quotes . note if you have to put up with that , i hope she ' s a ten . 
best halal cart i have ever been to and they have the " vendy award " to prove it . they are super nice and efficient when taking orders . i don ' t know if it ' s a bad thing that they always remember me . i think i eat here too much , but it ' s just so good . schwarma , falafel , chicken w yellow rice . these are all things you must try from here . the hot sauce is very hot , so i recommend getting some of the vegetables on the pita or plate to cool down . the " white " sauce is also a must . everything seems to be freshly made every day . the price is right . you should be paying more for the quality and how authentic the food is . that chicken is made with love ! 
we used to go there because the food was good and delicious . however , their service was not great . i asked on the phone if i can use the coupon to take out . the lady said that it ' s no problem . but , they charged me the full price when i went picking up my food . when i tried to confront this , the lady totally ignored me . not going back , 
food was pretty good , nothing to write home about . service was confusing . . . i asked her what she liked on the menu , and she was like , " huh ? idk . . . " i couldn ' t tell if she was having a bad day or just didn ' t like people . for the price in new york city , not all too bad . would i go back ? sure , just to make sure i didn ' t miss out on some awesomely delicious and bodaciously inexpensive meal that i have yet to try ( ordering the cod sandwich wasn ' t the boldest choice i ' ve made ) . 
first time dining here and went to see what the fuss was about after viewing guy fieri ' s " diners , drive-ins , and dives " episode highlighting nj diners . unfortunately , this place does not live up to its celebrity status . the breakfast lunch menus were enticing with options such as the jersey shore burger and banana upside down pancakes but alas , the quality of the food was mediocre at best . service was decent and the waitress warranted a nice tip but the prices for the food were exorbitant . two cheeseburgers , two cups of coffee , and a lindsor tart for N ? next time i ' ll pass on this place and use the money to buy a bottle of booze and lament over the fact that i have still not found a fabulous brunch location in nj . 
what can you say ? tony ' s is great . i work a few blocks down and there is nothing like refueling with a chicken pita with cooked onions and extra tzatziki sauce . not a lot of people realize this but tony ' s also has a ton of other great food on the menu . you can get juicy burgers , steaks , rice and salad plates . . . the works ! today for example i feasted on a prosciutto and fresh mozzarella hero . i ' m giving this N stars because a street vendor can ' t get much better than this . go satisfy your crave for tony ' s today ! -- warning it ' s best to avoid the tzatziki sauce before any hot dates or important business meetings . 
i really enjoyed dining at shake shack ! son recommended it . the burger was fantastic . i am normally a chicken tender person . the fries were very tasty , and just enough too . the shake was great for a custard blend . the staff was excellent . the waitress karima was the absolute best . we chatted a little and she uplifted my spirits while eating . she turned a upsetting day into a great day . i was full and happy from the both the food and the service . i really liked the music . very enjoyable to listen to . the place is very comfortable with big windows to look out of . the food is cooked fresh daily and shakes made fresh . nice and thick ! i like that they check to see how you are enjoying your food , or do you need anything and take your finished tray away . very professional . the food didn ' t take long either . the location for me is the best . right on my way home from work . i will definitely return again and with friends . thanks for a very enjoyable dining experience shake shack ! p . s . the location is Nth sansom st . between chestnut and walnut st . 
i ' ve bee here several times for parties in the back room . the food is blah at best . maybe their party plates are lackluster compared to the private dining menu ? the only thing that is worth bragging about is the cheesecake . the cheesecake is delicious . i ' m pretty sure it is not done in house . the sangria is blah . the chorizo is good . the shrimp in garlic sauce is ok . stuffed clams is pretty good ( yay for bacon ) . the paella lacked saffron . don ' t waste your money here . 
went to nai for my birthday with N people . they could not have been more accommodating , responsive and helpful . the experience was well beyond expectations and i will definitely be back . in fact , i bet all of my N guests will go back on their own . the flamenco is not cheesy , as some might think . it ' s a real surprise in an otherwise mundane city of restaurants with no oomph . what to order . . . gambas ajillo - shrimp in garlic sauce - superb ! croquetas de jamon - serrano ham croquetttes - a very nice dish ! croquetas de pollo - chicken croquettes albondiguillas - meatballs in brandy sauce- so delicious ! patatas alioli - potato in creamy garlic sauce patatas bravas - potato in spicy tomato sauce tortilla espanola - spanish omelet churrasco - skirt steak sauteed with spicy cherry peppers and garlic chorizo plancha- grilled spanish sausage bacalao frito . - fresh cod loin lightly fried . 
pretty good but the chicken tastes like cardboard . i ' d rather go to another cart in nyc and not wait in the long line of tourists . 
i ' m lovin it ! ! ! ! all the ingredients are organic ! ! you know , healthy food usually means not delectable , but the green table successfully combines green food with a good taste ! ! ! thumbs up ! ! ! seared scallop and mushroom pie are just as fabulous as you can imagine ! ! ! 
the food is very good , with very generous portions . me and my girlfriend both got N dishes that were heaping woks of delicious noodles and meat . i love this place . 
love the zha zha mien . excellent fresh noodles the way noodles should be ! 
cuban pete ' s used to be a resturant that i would recommend to friends , but after last night ' s disrespectful discriminatory act by either the owner or manager ( some guy with a mustache ) i would never eat there again . cuban pete ' s is ignorant in recognizing the fact that someone can be disabled without appearing to be . do not eat at a place where the mangagement can be soo disrespectful to the customers . . . . . the customer is always right ! 
tre scalini is on the corner of wooster st . aka " lil italy " in new haven . i have been coming here for years , and have never had a bad meal . there are a lot of good italian restaurants in new haven , and i have a few other favorites , but this place is definitely at the top of my list . the food is authentic , fresh , and amazing ! they have different specials every day so even if you are a regular there is something new to always try . they have a very impressive and extensive wine list that would please any wine enthusiast . definitely a must try place if any one is looking for authentic italian food in the new haven area . 
what a great place ! cozy and comfortable and the food is amazing . bring your own bottle of wine is a huge plus ! 
stony ' s has been open for about N months and i ' ve been hooked on their chicken sandwich with gorgonzola . i get it with the works and it is gloriously messy and delicious . i know it ' s supposed to be a burger place , but i just can ' t tear myself away from that chicken . . . until tonight . we had a birthday party at the house and we all ordered bomber burgers with grilled onions and tomatoes . N minutes later the order was delivered to our door by joel , the friendly delivery man . omg , the burger was fantastic ! i know stony is a trained chef and his attention to his craft comes through loud and clear in his hamburger . for beginners , the bun is probably the best i ever had . follow that up with a lean , yet juicy beef patty and succulent grilled onions and you have yourself a masterpiece ! 
the food was amazing and the service was even better ! i had the fish tacos and ain ' t lemonade . the fish was perfectly cooked and crispy , and the flavored were all so balanced . the staff was so attentive ! one of the best restaurant experiences that i have had in a long time ! ! ! so good ! 
this restaurant is just ok . few side dishes and pricey . i ' ve been driving all the way to ichiban restaurant in hartford just to get great korean food . their food there is miles better with more choices . i would try yamadora korean resto in east haven to see if their food is worth coming back . 
i love my neighborhood and the businesses that make it what it is . i have been to chavela ' s a few times and have never fallen in love but gave it another chance tonight as it is always busy and a popular spot with good reviews . my friend and i got a pitcher of the draft margarita . first mistake . do not ever order it . it is just caloric lemonade with no alcohol . my friend and i split almost an entire pitcher and were not buzzed in the slightest , where as a normal margarita on its own would do the job . the guacamole is pretty good but nothing i can ' t make myself . they messed up our order which ended up resulting in free food for us but still , the margarita was so bad and expensive it didn ' t make up for the food . i love crown heights , i support local , but i will not come back to chavela ' s and do not recommend it . 
i had lunch at this egan and sons location and was pretty happy with it . no , i was thrilled with it as i enjoyed an incredible butternut squash soup . if you go there for lunch and they are serving this soup , you must get it . 
this is my second visit here and i think i could cheerfully spend a whole day here , aside from the crowds ! what an amazing selection of wonderful food ! we started with breakfast at pearl ' s which even has real maple syrup . we stocked up on sausages , cheeses and baked goods and drooled over coffees , crepes and beautiful mountains of fresh produce . i love this place ! 
what i love about manhattan you get to choose between big , fancy schmancy places that charge an arm and a leg for mediocrity , and the " no bullshit , just good food for value " places that you find after making a wrong turn down a street . cafe condesa is the latter . the place is cozy and fits no more than N or so tables . the smells from the kitchen waft over the space and linger it does get in your hair and clothes , but that isn ' t a bad thing here . it ' s like you ' re taking a piece of the goodness home with you . order rib-eye steak comes with double baked potatoes , roasted sweet onions , guacamole , and watercress . friend ' s order salmon dessert chocolate souffle with cinnamon ice cream the rib-eye was made a perfect medium rare . the potatoes were a great side , and it was the first thing i finished on my plate . the roasted sweet onions came in the form of one half of a red onion- not really contributing much to the dish . it ' s not that it didn ' t taste good , but why didn ' t they just chop it up and lay it over the steak ? kind of a waste of space on my dish . could have done without it . my bite of salmon was good . i don ' t usually like chocolate souffles because i find them on the heavy side , but i loved the cinnamon ice cream they used . the flavors were great together . overall , the food was delicious , and i do hope to return ! 
i have been coming to bella since it ' s original location on bloomfield ave . in clifton where we used to wait on line for an hour to get in standing in a narrow hallway . . well it ' s long moved out of that location and many will say that the quality of the food has gone way down . that may be true to a certain degree but bella still has the best italian food hands down . the chicken scarpiello is the best i have ever had , either on or off the bone . i am also a fan of the chicken francaise . the salad you get before the entreee is simple but flavorful . i do miss the old servers , most of them are gone . we used to have coco serve us who was with them for years and years and she is gone . when we go out for italian it ' s bella or bust . in my opinion it is the only italian worth spending my hard earned money . 
i stopped in with a friend for the oyster happy hour , then the rain started , so we decided to stay for dinner . i ' m very glad we did . we sat at the bar and began with the octopus appetizer , very tender and an unusual preparation with chickpeas , nuts and basil , definitely a must . pate with pickled radishes were also a nice surprise , i think it was the bread that did it . it had that slightly sweet and nuttiness that complimented it so well . my friend then had the thai mussels , generous portion , dipping the bread in the broth was addictive , he couldn ' t stop . i had the market fish with greens in a bacon broth , it disappeared in front of me . could be because i ' m a little bit of a bacon addict . i also tried the bacon infused bourbon cocktail , i will stop by for more of those in the next few days . i sincerely recommend this place to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a great meal without breaking the bank . it was very reasonable . bartender was friendly and knowledgeable . it was a terrific evening . 
pizza is good . service good . 
this place is amazing ! ! ! the food is home made and when you are there you feel like part of the family ! ! the vegetarian selection is extensive and has plenty of meat options so my husband can both eat . . . a lot ! ! ! i get the falafel with babaganoush , its fantastic ! ! ! if you haven ' t tried it yet , you are definitely missing out ! namaste ! 
we went midweek . we weren ' t expecting it to be as big and cozy inside because it was in a small strip mall . we were pleasantly surprised . however , the place was empty with exception of a couple of small groups at the bar where we sat . then we looked at the menu and noticed the prices were a bit high . we ordered N martinis which came in a small glasses . we got an artichoke app for N . the dip was served in a small bread bowl . the pita chips were tasty , however they significantly outnumbered the small dip portion . we ordered a sausage and pasta dish entree and an eggplant rollatini app as an entree . i asked if the eggplant had the skin on it and the bartender checked with the chef who said it didn ' t . after our app , we waited for quite some time for the bartenders to notice our drinks were empty . there were about N people at the bar besides us and N bartenders . they walked by us several times and passed the empty glasses pushed to the edge . right before our meal came they acknowledged us and got us two glasses of wine . my eggplant looked dry , and it was . it had skin on it eventhough we were told it didn ' t . the pasta and broccoli rabe dish was tasty but the broccoli rabe was gritty . i ate half of my dish before we could flag a bartender for more marinara sauce . noone ever asked how our meals were and it took a long time to get our plates cleared , get a to go container and get the check . overall , the atmosphere was nice but the service was poor , food adequate , and prices too high . we won ' t be back . 
this is my go-to filipino spot in the city . it ' s more of a mom and pop spot then a trendy nyc joint , but you can tell it ' s home cooked goodness . the first few times i ' ve been there , there have been lots of filipino ' s eating there . people of the cuisine eating at the restaurant is always a strong indicator for success at an ethnic restaurant . my go to dishes are the chicken adobo and kare kare . the chicken falls right off the phone . the kare kare is great , i ' m a sucker for ox tail , but may have too much peanut taste for some . i didn ' t like the pork belly as it was too chewy for my taste . but i love the fact that i can always get a seat , get good food quickly , and i can depend on this restaurant for a few go-to dishes . i ' d also recommend that bok choy . 
after numerous visits service , food , music , atmosphere . . . perfect ! great prices ! 
honestly , i ' m a bit baffled by the positive reviews because my friends and i had an awful experience here . on first entering ( btw entering through a garden gate does not a great restaurant make ) it ' s a cute looking little place . very tight on space , but visually nice looking . that ' s where the good times stop . crowd not the most attractive . in fact , pretty bridge ' n ' tunnel . couples full on making out at the bar and pushing into our table . so yes , not exactly a classy crowd . . . food appetizer and main where ok , fairly standard . desert was downright bad . we all had one bite of each of the N we ' d ordered , and couldn ' t touch any more . service . pretty much the worst service i ' ve ever had . have never felt so rushed . our food came out at different times . they then removed plates when we were still eating ! the waitress literally took my plate while i had food in my mouth . she was hovering over us so obviously trying to get us the hell out of there that it made the experience feel so hurried and unpleasant , when a good meal in a good restaurant should be relaxed , easy and fun . to be fair to the waitress , i think she was under ridiculous pressure to keep the crowds moving and the tables turning over . i think she ( or her boss ) even called for back up since we had guy waiters coming over to help clear etc . towards the end of the meal ( when we finally gave up and left ) they cleared our glasses still filled with wine and water ! i swear we were not taking an abnormally long amount of time . yes , we were a few minutes late for our table , but that is all . this crazy " service " started from the moment we sat down and progressed on the crazy scale for the duration of our hour and a half meal . i think at least one of the owners was there . shortish weasely guy , floppy lank hair , badly dressed . he flitted about with an unpleasant arrogance and an overbearing attitude . not nice . will not be going back . will not recommend . in fact , will warn all of my well moneyed influencer-about-town friends to stay well away . 
best pizza ever ! love every bite ! yum ! 
do not go to this restaurant if you have a theater reservation or need to leave in a timely manner ! we arrived at N . Npm for our N . Npm reservation . we were told a table would be ready in minutes so waited at the bar . by N . Npm we were still waiting we warned them we had a tight schedule and needed to leave by N . Npm and were duly promised we would be seated by Npm . by N . Npm we were still waiting and increasingly concerned . at this point the manager told us that a table has become free but had been given away by mistake since they thought we were eating at the bar . we had expressly told the ma tre d that we were waiting for a table at the bar and she was fully aware since we kept on asking about the table - so i don ' t know how that happened . no apology at all- in fact the manager argued and said he could do nothing . nice venue , great bar staff who tried to make up for it . but steer clear if you need to get somewhere on time . they do not respect your time or reservation . 
just lovely . the service was phenomenal and i am not even exaggerating . my boyfriend took me here for our two year anniversary . since it was such a special occasion , he whipped out his fancy pair of black sweatpants ( i know , i ' m so lucky ! ) . sweatpants and all , they still gave us the best service ever ! the waiters look like they ' re secret service agents and they know what you need even before you do ! they ' re extremely attentive and super nice and you never have to ask for more water or wine or anything ! it didn ' t hurt that the food was delicious and to die for ! even though we had reservations , we had to wait a bit for our table . . . but unlike most places where you have to uncomfortably stand at a bar and stare at the hostess to make sure she hasn ' t forgot about you . . . there ' s a whole jazz bar on the side where you can sit in an actual booth , sip your wine , enjoy a cheese plate , and listen to live music while you wait . the hostess will know exactly where you are at all times and you don ' t have to worry about loosing your table . if you don ' t want to go all out for dinner you should at least come in for some wine and cheese . it ' s a great place for a date . just come in , grab a booth , have some wine and cheese . . . it ' ll still be the best experience ! great place . 
very cute little japanese inspired restaurant in the middle of downtown hartford . dropped by for a late dinner on a friday night and got carded at the door by some jerk that looked like he just turned N . it appears that they are attempt at having a lounge type atmosphere . there was a dj , but i was unsure as to what he was actually doing because there was Ns music videos were pumping throughout and photo slide shows of past guests and parties appeared on other screens . from what i can tell there is a awful lot of boob flashing and groping that goes on there ( very classy ) . the crowd is as mixed as hartford can get . the food and drinks were good , but a little on the expensive side . N for a sake-tini that barely gave me a buzz . the calamari appetizer was good , just beware that its only tentacles and the portion is very small . their fried rice was delicious , but also expensive . although i wasn ' t that impressed , it was worth a try and i ' ll probably go back in the future . 
i have a monthly girls dinner where we each pick a place each month . i only get to pick every N months and this was mine and i ' m so happy with my choice ! it may have just dethroned vedge as everyone ' s favorite place we ' ve been to in the last N months ! atmosphere is nice , understated , not too crowded , not too loud , not too quiet . good for a small group or a date , they could only accommodate a group of N for dinner on a weeknight rather early ( N N ) with about a month ' s notice . opentable ' s limit for online reservations is N people . top secret information you can byob . this is confusing , because they have a full bar , and a wine list . but as the hostess ( ? ) told me on the phone " were just flexible . " there is no corkage fee . however , the cocktails are pretty good so you kind of miss out there by bringing your own . food . we ate quite a lot of it . it was all amazing , but if you have to pick , here ' s what you need to know small plates -- you must get at least one of the raw fish dishes ( but preferably all of them . ) hamachi tartare , raw scallops , fluke crudo . we almost got into a fight about which one was the best . we couldn ' t decide . it would be like picking a favorite child ( if i had N kids that were equally not annoying ) . --duck liver mousse was excellent and they even brought out matzah for my passovering friend ! --deep fried duck leg- very very good , but , overhyped . the way people talk about it on yelp you ' d think it was life changing . they ' re paying homage to peking duck here , but i just like peking duck more . --cope ' s corn ravioli was good and very interesting . --sliced pig head was interesting but not my fave , tastes like fancy lunch meat with mustard , i ' d pass on this . --chilled dashi soup was very interesting but also overhyped for me . liked the concept and the creme fraiche jelly , but i ' d pass on this too unless you ' re a big cold soup person . large plates --the trout won our affections as the dark horse winner of the large plates , but really all of these were excellent . --absolutely recommend getting the seasonal vegetables to split- the lemon puree was awesome . --the lamb and short ribs were both amazing , tender , delicious , flavorful and paired well with the sides . i loved the eggplant dipping sauce for the lamb . --the pork and kimchi stew would have been good at another restaurant , but here it was the less cute sibling in a beautiful family . also , it was trying to be kimchi chiggae , but just wasn ' t as good or as different from kimchi chiggae to be impressive . desserts --apple cake was the clear winner . so good . still thinking about it . --rocky road was good too , but didn ' t blow my mind . --goat cheese sorbet blew my mind , but it was so weird i couldn ' t quite get behind it . overall a wonderful meal , great experience and i would definitely recommend for a fancy night out . it ' s a bit pricey ( we had a gift card but without it it would have been N each with tax , tip , and not even a cocktail each ) . granted we were super full . you could probably byob and be satisfied for around N each . 
i like the food here and the mall is there to walk around , 
we stopped by here after walking around central park thanks to yelp- boy were we satisfied ! the place is small so we had to wait about N-N mins for a table , but the wait was well worth it . the hot sandwiches were amazing- i ordered the italian , and i wasn ' t disappointed one bit . the bread was just how i liked it- extra crispy with a soft doughiness inside . the mozzarella was fresh , and the meat was scrumptious . one of my friends was a vegetarian and ordered the caprese sandwich-- next time i ' m screwing the meat and ordering it ! it was delcious ! i ' m a huge coffee espresso fan- the moccachino is the best i ' ve had . am looking forward to going back to it again-- soon ! 
for sandwiches go with capsul , just amazing ! the harvest salad is off the charts , i also am a big fan of their chilly , the service is always friendly , and quick , they have free wifi as well
there ' s just something about this place that i think is soo cute . i just love the decor - its quaint . i came here once and ordered the artichoke dip ( which burned my mouth really badly ) , the chicken entree and the apple crisp . my husband had the burger . the artichoke dip was really good , but it just shouldn ' t come out that hot . i probably would have given N stars if my mouth wasn ' t peeling for the next few days . the apple crisp was amazing , but the waitress didn ' t want to give me a second scoop of ice cream ! i ran out . . how was i supposed to finish without another scoop ? i asked one of the guys that cleans up the table to give me a scoop and he did . . thank god . 
like every man i love good baked meat . steakhouses are my thing and i have tried many of them . had it ever happened to you that you eat a steak and cannot say a word because that moment of silence and deliciousness in your mouth is a blessing ? that ' s how i feel in this place ! 
this was our second visit to parc ( N N N ) , and i have to say it was even better than our first ! amazing food , great ambiance , and awesome service . their menu includes a large assortment of french classics , and being one of stephen starr ' s many restaurants they really know how to make it feel individualized , almost as if it was a privately owned bistro in france . can ' t wait to go back ! 
it ' s not just about the quality of the coffee , or the pastries , but rather the attitude of the people who serve you that makes the difference . there have been several instances when i came in with a negative attitude due to the cold weather , waking up too early , or just not being in a good mood and left with a happy vibe because of the positive attitude that the workers have which naturally rubs off on you . i would definitely urge people to check this place out ! not to mention the coffee is great . 
we went in january . friendly staff , chef came and delivered our food . bus person very friendly giving us infomation history on the red hook area . the carrot cake was incredible and my friends really enjoyed the apple pie . would look into visiting in the warmer weather when it ' s wide open . i had a ceasar salad clam chowder that was very good . we saw crab delivered to other tables and they were huge ! we ' ll be back ! ! 
great service and amazing indian food ( so different from all the other places in edison ) . highly recommend the lunch buffet ! 
bienets ! have those to finish off . i was there for brunch and enjoyed the space more than anything . the windows bring in a lot of light and the high ceilings makes it feel refreshing and inviting . the bar however , can be a bit bigger . 
kind of embarrassed with myself how many times i ' ve stopped in here to eat . it ' s really uninspired . the only not good things i ' ve tried were the two noodle dishes - lo mein and dan-dan . both were very mushy and flavorless . all of the dishes have pretty much the same look to them . pile of meat pile of rice meager addition of vegetables . the sauces don ' t taste exactly the same , but they are close enough to make it not really matter at all what you order , especially if you ' re adding hot sauce . it ' s not bad , it ' s just not good . 
excellent food and service ! ! ! the girl who served us was nice and attentive . crepes were perfect . salty crepes tasted better than their sweet counterparts . we had chicken , mussels and prosciutto . . . all good ! ! ! for desserts we ordered ice cream cup and banana flambee . i hardly tasted a spoonful of ice cream but cream . . . and the flambee was too bitter with finished my meal with little disappointment . . . overall it ' s a nice little restaurant that you cannot miss . 
expensive . . . . but damnnnn good ! great service good hours . . . much better than the msg filled crap in the ' hood
i went there on last thursday and i thought it was spectacular . you order from the counter , pick up your food on trays when they call your number , get your own utensils , and find a seat at the all-communal tables . they have people cleaning the tables and refilling water regularly , and tips can be left on the table or in the jar at the counter . the N duck over rice gets you half of one side of the breast , over rice and some greens which i was told were red mustard frill . the duck is cooked to a perfect , tender , pink . the duck is juicy and the flavor is fresh . the skin is crisp , and reminds me of good chinese style barbecued duck , except that it ' s not as sweet and hasn ' t been hanging all morning . the rice and greens are extremely satisfying after soaking in some of the flavorful drippings of the duck breast . i also had the broccoli salad , which was ok . the smoked eel vinaigrette was not particularly strong , providing only a slight smoky flavor , and the crispy rendered duck skin added some crunchy texture . it was served chilled , and for N had a decent amount of broccoli , when you compare it to similarly-priced sides at otto or torrisi . a couple of customers after me had to wait a little longer as they had just put fresh ducks on the rotisserie . i ' m not sure how they would handle it if there were a lot of customers . overall i thought it was simple , delicious , and satisfying . 
i had chicken platter with rice and pita bread covered with white and red sauce . the meat had flavor but to me it was like any other cart food and wouldn ' t stand in line again for it . 
great place to go before or after a show at the kimmel center . 
always liked that place and always will . more a lunch place for me , dinner gets too " cool " and then i can ' t stand the attitude and the smelly waiter anymore . lunch , i can deal . food is always good , sometimes they tried too hard but burger or steak always a N stars . see you soon
very nice inside , very very good food , and great service ! 
please ! someone explain to me why the best lemonades in brooklyn are not on the menu . my kids enjoyed the strawberry lemonade and my wife and i indulged in the pineapple ginger . my god ! i know it was popular , everyone were drinking it and at times they actually ran out of it . the lemonade they are selling now is an insult to the patrons who spent the same amount of money for the quality drink from last summer . please bring it back . please
great place to get a variety of food in you and maybe sober up a little after a wild drunken night in ( fill in the blank ) where your friends repeatedly told you to " dude , seriously , calm down on that stuff . " . the waitresses hate making milkshakes but i ' m a huge fan of kelis so get one anyway . it ' s a pretty good diner . i want to give it three out of five but i ' ve had so many good times here that i feel obligated to give them four . enjoy . 
the newest " daily show " offering of an open face turkey dinner is the ultimate in exceptional comfort food . the moist turkey , stuffing , string beans and cranberry sauce hits the right note . i love that the " daily show " changes with the seasons . 
yumm ! i used to go there almost once a week . most delicious and unique bread balls with the black bean dip . . . salmon is great as well . 
i was really excited to go to luzzo ' s for dinner with my boyfriend , i read the reviews and everything . it was packed when we got there , good sign , right ? ? wrong ! ! ! i guess no one understands what makes a good pizza or italian place . . for many reasons . . . firstly , we had to wait a few minutes to be seated , so we sat at the bar and ordered some wine . waiting a few minutes wasn ' t the problem . the problem was that out of all the wine they had on their " wine list " , only N of them did they actually have on hand . the wine wasn ' t anything special , and we were a little disappointed for an italian place . . they are the ones that know wine after all . we were then seated in the back , looked nice and romantic , but was so loud we couldn ' t even hear ourselves think , let alone , hear one another . so we moved back to the bar and ate there . the salad we ordered was decent , but who can really mess up a green salad . . . the pizza we got was disgusting ! ! ! ! it said on the menu that it came with roasted garlic , basil and we added olives . if we didn ' t add the olives the pizza would have been uneatable . there was only N pieces of basil and N pieces of garlic on the whole N " pizza . and to top it all off it tasted like they had cooked it with chlorine . i ' m not the type to complain , but the whole experience was unpleasant . the only part i liked about it was the salad , which i could have easily put together at home . the N . N a slice pizza around the corner is N better than this expensive stuff . don ' t go ! ! save your money and your stomach ! ! 
get the sangria , come hungry and with good company . eat anything that appeals to you . everything on the menu is delicious ( i ' ve tried almost all of it ) great place to impress a date . it ' s tapas and perfect for long dinners with good conversation . if i made more money i would come here monthly . staff makes you feel special . you won ' t be disappointed ! 
just went for the first time to grab a snack after running . had the carne mechada arepa and it was absolutely delicious . very tender and flavorful meat , the bun was dense ( in a good way ) with a slight crunch and a great corn flavor , the sauce was creamy and garlicky . nice owners . they said that today and tomorrow all arepas are N . i ' ll definitely be back . a great addition to the neighborhood . 
one of my best japanese places in the town . everything is in high quality , much better than how it looks . never tried japanese hot pot and pork tonsoku before , they are so good ! especially pork tonsoku , crispy outside , tender inside with the right amount of flavor . addicted . must make reservation ahead . 
boy oh boy , people love to complain . don ' t judge this placed based on it ' s reviews , blame it on not enough people taking the time out to say how much fun they have here and how cheap it was . but know what you ' re getting into before you go . leave the kids at home . . . and find your friends . this place is great to get drunk and people watch . the food is delicious and the people , hilarious . the bar is pretty decent , they have rouge dead guy ) and the service is entertaining . the bar is set up weird and i noticed my server get backed up due to the awkward set up of things , so i didn ' t blame her if it wasnt N star service . . it isn ' t N star in the first place ! every server i ' ve had has been a true personality , they have fun all while getting the job done . they engage in conversation and aren ' t afraid of being themselves , which for me creates a comfortable atmosphere . love it . 
the food is good , i personally prefer la superior for traditional mexican but this is far more decadent than theirs . the food here was excellent , really a big fan of almost everything that we got . unconvinced about the bone marrow tacos . . . but , other than that , i would defs come back to play around here . 
i wanted to treat my dad who is a sea food fanatic . he loved all the seafood selections at the buffet and i loved it that he loved it . ) . i do not eat so much sea food but they had plenty for me to enjoy too . i will definitely go back again . 
what beats raw fish that melts in your mouth ? how about a group of four not being able to get seated despite two empty double tables adjacent to each other how about minimum charge , slow service , etcetcetcetc ? ehhhhhhhhhh the waiters are genuinely good ppl . the chef is an asshole who ' s so good at what he ' s doing that he makes every other sushi chef in town look like a clown the food here is legit . hot or cold . rice or fish or even the miso soup . 
great stop ! perfect coffee , delicious baked goods , clean restroom , ve
this is great japanese food . for a fun meal sit at the bar and you will see the chefs like ninjas jumping from one end to the other and handing you your food with a long spatula . everything grilled to perfection but keep in mind portions are very small so you keep ordering then you end up surprised with a large bill . 
when i used to live in bk i would come here all the time ! ! such a deal . i miss the falafel sandwich . 
good customer service , always friendly . food is delicious . what more can you ask for ? at time the waiting is long , but its worth it . 
it was my second time at maggie mcfly ' s and it went better then my first experience . my first time there i thought the food was ok , but very overpriced . this time out i thought the food was good and somewhat overpriced , but i was there for lunch this time and not dinner , so that might be part of it . overall , the atmosphere is fun and funky , with cool light fixtures . the waitstaff was friendly , but busy . i will give it another shot in a couple of months . 
good beer selection , cool pizza choices and good food in general . compared to chain restaurants , this place knocks it out of the park . but compared to the wealth of amazing food philly , and south philly in particular , has to offer , its just about average . i don ' t know that there was anything here that would drag me from another neighborhood of the city . but if i was already in the area i would love to come back again . 
i liked the old name and atmosphere better . . . but the bartenders are still the highlight of the establishment . 
it could be worse they could not take reservations at maialino , and then you ' d be waiting for hours for any table at all . as it is , try checking open table at N Nam exactly for new reservations or put yourself on the wait list ( seemingly a futile task , but at least it makes you feel like you ' ve done something ) . the good news the bar area , which is saved for walk-ins , has a different menu , but they will try to accommodate you if you want something from the trattoria menu . also , sometimes people don ' t show up for their tables . this is another restaurant that ' s worth the wait , especially for the pastas . the spaghetti carbonara is fantastic , as is the malfatti with pork and arugula . a roomy , casual spot with that danny meyer ' s signature gee-whiz friendly service , which is so quintessentially american it takes away from the roman-ness of the concept - but authentic italy is still what you ' ll taste on the plate . 
my favorite burger is a classic beef burger and they just cook it right ! i ' m giving only three stars , mainly because their service can be on the slow side and it ' s little pricey for a burger . other than that if you want to splurge yourself with some good burger hoping the meat is cooked right for you , you should go here ! 
summary a novel chinese restaurant experience . not for the weak hearted or the mild stomached , but enjoyable food . moderately priced , and great portion sizes make it a place worth checking out . --- there is a scene in one of the tintin books , tintin in tibet to be precise , where captain haddock is fooled by mischievous nepalese street urchins into thinking that a red pimento is a sweet fruit . in the following panel the captain is shown running towards a water tank hollering " fire ! " . my sentiments were not far from his through most of my dinner at han ' s dynasty in old city . this chinese restaurant is located very close to penn ' s landing near the intersection of front and chestnut . the outward facade is pretty nondescript it took us a few seconds to locate it even though we were standing right outside it . the interiors also resemble a standard chinese restaurant in the usa . we were seated with customary oriental efficiency , and the menu card seemed to be the first indication that this affair would probably be a little different then from what one would expect in ' new dragon ' or ' fortune cookie ' . almost every item in the menu is accompanied with a number between N to N , printed in red . one could be fooled into believing these were prices , except that would make it a very cheap dinner . digging deeper , one would see that it is indeed , as the astute reader might ' ve guessed , the spice level . interesting ! my friend and i ordered the cold chicken in chilli sauce ( N ) as an appetizer , and the lamb dry pot ( N ) and cumin chicken ( N ) as the main course . the appetizer came out promptly sliced chicken breasts dunked in a bowl of chili oil , garnished with scallions and peppered with the famous sichuan pepper , served cold . on taking the first bite into the chicken , the chili mildly hit me . i remember at that point joking that if this was seven , ten would be child ' s play . i am not sure if the server heard us or not , but he came over to our table and informed that we hadn ' t mixed the pepper yet . indeed . sichuan pepper has a very interesting effect it is supposed to be tongue numbing , but it left the tip of my tongue tingling . if i drank hot tea , it felt as if i was being tickled there . it was a novel experience , one that i would like to try again some day . the dry pot and the cumin chicken came out shortly after . the dry pot was very spicy . at the end of our meal , with a lot of help from my friend , we did finish all our food . the spoils in the dry pot after we were done consisted of at least N red chilies , if not more . no wonder i was reminded of , and sympathized with , the captain poor thing was expecting a dessert ! the problem i have with super-spicy food is , although i really enjoy the whole gushing experience , that it hides other flavors that are present . for instance , i am not sure the lamb was well cooked - i sure didn ' t enjoy it , and maybe a more neutral tasting meat like chicken would be a better choice for the dry pot . the cumin chicken , although not as spicy as the dry pot , had a little too much cumin for my taste which overwhelmed all the other flavors in the dish . nonetheless , it is a novel experience , and i would recommend it . although i craved for something sweet after dinner , we were quite full to order any desserts . in fact , we were not even offered a dessert menu , so i am not sure if this joint serve them . nonetheless , something sweet is highly recommended post-han dynasty . as i write this , some three hours since dinner , i can still feel the heat . 
let me first start by saying , that i am not a heathen by any sense of the word , but oh my god . . . i wanted to lick my plate when i ' m done . enough so that my server even offered to turn his head as i pretended to do so . this place is a bit pricey , but i would gladly pay for the level of service and the food all over again every single day . now , i may need to win the lottery to go every single day , especially considering i live in ohio and i ' d have to fly there . . . ok , tangent . but seriously , you get the picture . i also do not eat a ton of meat because i ' m a weirdo and i ' m big on texture . if i get a piece of chicken with gristle in it for example , i can ' t another bite . so , i will admit , i was very hesitant when i decided to order the short rib for dinner with the mashed potatoes and gravy . the server assured me it was a delicious choice over whatever else i was pondering , so i said , " what the hell ? i ' m on a mini vacation right ? i may as well splurge a little and take a chance . " when they brought out this bowl of magical deliciousness , the aroma reminded me of those old cartoons , were it would turn into a finger beckoning you over to it . i wanted to put my face into the mashed potatoes and just inhale them . the short rib was not what i expected it to be , it was a million times better , and good gravy was it tender . i have never eaten a better selection of meat in my life , and i ' m not even kidding . it was fantastic . the mashed potatoes and veggies i got were such a great compliment , and i really wish we had a red owl here . i would love to spoil myself with that tasty dish again sometime . the atmosphere seemed dressy but was really laid back , and everything looked so industrial and so well put together . we sat up in the balcony and were overlooking the place . fantastic ! ! ! 
i love this place . my husband and i have been going here since it opened and it ' s great . we have always had a good meal and service . the outdoor space is a bonus , and there ' s not many with it in the neighborhood . looking forward to many more dinners here . 
delicious simple burger , amazing bartenders , great atmosphere , awesome prices , takes cards . . . cannot ask for a better place on ave c . 
this place is definitely worth going to . the menu items are reasonably priced , the quality of the food is high , they have an extensive wine list , and a great atmosphere . i have yet to try something i did not like ( personal favorites are the brussel sprouts salad and the gnocchi ) . one complaint i do have is that the regular menu does not seem to change much . the place can be busy at surprising times ( tuesday night , for example ) but the service is always great , albeit a bit slow when they are busy . great for a date night , happy hour , or a night out with friends ! 
my friend and i went here a couple weeks ago and the food was amazing . i want to go back and try their different udons and ramens . if you go make sure to try their pork buns it is so so so good ! the only thing i didn ' t like about this place is that the workers kept staring at me and my friend . although attentive service is more than welcome i felt really scrutinized while eating so despite the yummy food i was slightly uncomfortable . my friend also agreed with me
be very careful if you are considering palma for a private event . we recently went to check out their " carriage house " for an upcoming rehearsal dinner the night before our son ' s wedding . in fairness , we did not have an appointment and just popped in on them . when we were told that the person in charge was too busy to show us the space , we could not complain . in her place , we were assigned a very knowledgeable -seeming young man . it immediately became apparent that the carriage house would not be big enough for our party of N . the gentleman then suggested the garden room which the carriage house connects to . the garden room is lovely , and we were intrigued . he told us that the minimum would be an N . N a head for a prix fixe meal , plus drinks , and a N . N fee for the room . the room fee seemed low to us , but he stuck to it , even when i said , " i ' m glad to hear it is not N . N . " we made one final attempt to deal with jessica , the person in charge , but we were told that she was too busy to deal with us at that moment . no problem . we emailed her our request and were told flat out that the space was not available on friday nights . when we appealed , we were told that the price on a week night for the garden is N . N , plus food and drinks . on a friday night , the price would be N-N , N . N . who are they kidding ? palma is an okay restaurant . it is not per se . even so , though , if you are going to show potential customers around , you need to have at least the basic information . N , N , N instead of N . N ? give me a break . there are far better places at more reasonable prices to hold an event , and they are not all involved in bait and switch . 
great food and drink . one of the best places to go to get a proper drink served right . try the rattling bird or the cobblestones and a tall pint . also check out there sunday breakfast , best eggs in a nest around . if there ' s only one place to go in hartford this is it . 
terrible experience
another great place in the city . another long wait to get it ! the best time to go is weekdays , and like everyone else says it ' s phenomenal ! the maple butter sauce that comes with the pancakes should be renamed . . . sex sauce . yummm ! i always get the southern breakfast . they have some of the best grits in the city . i think i ' m qualified to say so too ! - ) 
great place in the summer for all the brooklynites and my kids just love their pizza . 
i went to jake ' s sandwich board the other day and left completely satisfied . while i was looking at their menu my mouth was watering because it all sounded so good . i ended up ordering their signature sandwich jake and got the combo with fries and a coke . they definitely don ' t cheat you on the portion and you even get refills on the coke ' s . i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great philly cheese steak or just a good sandwich in general . i know i will be going back . 
best happy hour in the city ! 
eataly - rocking my socks since N ! ! ! eataly , ny is just as fantastic as eataly , roma . build like a market of wonders and magic . i first wondered in here few years ago with a mob of people . first few steps in i was welcomed by that aromatic gelateria ! and kind of got stuck in a stampede almost . it was christmas time . it was busy ! everyone was ooing and ahhing . i didn ' t mind . less effort it took for me to walk because all i need to do was let people push me forward ! not so bad after all . there ' s a coffee bar , gelato bar and next to it was the pastry bar . cookies , pizzlles , packaged coffee , dried pasta ! and on to the next . that pizzeria pasta bar . zomg , holy pasta ! and the meat shop ? that was drool worthy . and il pesce ? ? ! wowza ! ! here are my fav shops inside this mecca of all things food- il pesce - but of course ! all things seafood and shellfish ? yes please ! i had the best spot prawns and razor clams over here . they were absolutely divine . food is more on the tasting portion so it will be small but they were all perfectly tasty . la pizza la pasta- drool worthy , simple fresh pizza and pastas ! ahhh . i always end up eating buying so much here ! damn the noodle addict in me . but they are soo goooood . and they make my favorite roman dish-caccio e pepe ! need i say more ? nom nom . la piazza - standing tables only ! this is the place i ' ve spent my time waiting for tables at the other restaurant . grab some cheese , some wine , hang purse and chit chat like i ' m in venice , italy ! or those markets in roma . their housemade mozzarella , prosciutto , salami , the parma ! big plate of salami ! it is all that you want and more from a place like this . and last but not least- birreria ! ! --once you are done walking , stampeding all over downstairs , come up to the roof top ! viola- a roof top bar ! ! ! you can eat and drink all the beers on tap ! the view isn ' t all that shabby either . they have amazing meat dishes like braised pork shoulders , lamb chop etc . i ' ve spent many hot summer evenings here few years ago . they were the best ! ( given that you can find a table of course ) they also have manzo the steak house and la verdure- all things fresh and vegetable ! i ' ve skipped them on all of my visit . not because they look bad or anything . only because i only have limited space in my stomach and when it all comes down to it , i ' m a seafood girl ! definitely don ' t eat my veggies ! ( yea , got my big girls pants now ! ) meat i like but not over shellfish . and between the cheeses , spot prawns , pasta and that rooftop bar , i get to eat till i passed out . i ' ve yet to have a gelato here too because of the other things filled me up . overall , i love this ! all my favorite italian treats in one big space ! and many to take home to . yumm yummm ! 
their burgers are the bomb and they have an impressive selection of beers on tap . great late night spot
this place has a california feel and looks out of place in red hook ( real brooklynites-you know what i mean ) . it has by far the the nicest view of the city skyline , especially during the sunset . i went on a friday evening with my hubby for an early dinner date . we had very high hopes that fell extremely flat when we finally recieved what we ordered ( a very long wait ) surf turf and crab cakes . the steak was actually pretty good , well cooked and tasty . ironically , the lobster was small and the crab cakes sucked . . to put it nicely . to top it off , the bill was ridiculously high- seriously this is red hook , not midtown manhattan ! ! i gave brooklyn crab two stars for the decor and the out-doorsy feel , otherwise it would have been N star for the steak . i wouldn ' t recommend . 
i had heard from a friend that this place was good but i disagree . the food was average at best , the waitress was terrible , uninterested and then disappeared for quite awhile , couldn ' t get refills . and to top it off , was expensive . i don ' t mind paying for good food and service but got neither here . too many good itailian places in rutherford and lyndhurst to go back here . N stars is being generous for my experience . 
the pork chop and cheddar cheese waffles were great ! the pork chop was so juicy and flavorful , just a bit salty . N star taken off because the hostess wasn ' t very friendly at first when we put our name down . she told us to wait N minutes . we were standing there for N and saw people who came after us get seated . when my friend went up to her to ask when we can be seated and that others were going in before us she said what ' s your name ? i don ' t remember you with a stank attitude . wow lady we were standing their the whole time staring . rude i tell you . when we finally got seated she said sorry . well at least she said sorry but geez come on you could have been nicer . she probably knew i was going to write a review about this restaurant . food is great so i will come back again and disregard the little attitude . 
i had been wanting to visit this restaurant ever since i bought their cookbook . that was probably five years ago . having moved here recently , and an out of town friend coming in for a visit , i figured last night was the perfect opportunity . love the space . it is french . it is classic brasserie . it is also loud . not a knock on the loudness , just an observation . this place is wildly busy , yet maintains a great vibe . the food . i tried the pork porterhouse . it was a new addition to the plates du jour-tuesday . it was a very good cut of meat , and very tasty . i wouldn ' t get it again though . it felt like an entree that i could have had anywhere , and maybe that ' s what a good brasserie aims to do , but next time i ' ll be sure to be more thoughtful on my selection . my companion ordered the steak frites , and the steak disappointed . cooked to perfection , but had gristle running through that was like trying to chew through a rubber garden hose . the frites were wonderfully crisp on the outside and tender on the inside . the steak was a big miss . the pork delivered . i ' ll be back . 
i have been here for dinner a bunch and i absolutely love it . today i went for brunch and it was amazing ! i got the rigatoni with sausage and my friend got the belgium waffle . they also brought out the duck bolognese from the kitchen on the house because my friend is there almost every week . all three were fantastic- i can honestly say that the waffle was the best thing i have ever tasted . highly recommend this place , especially for brunch . there are not too many good places for brunch in philly , but who cares i guess if we have this place ! definitely going back as much as i can
i buy lunch from this place at least once a week and am a huge fan . great service , wonderful food , and the prices can ' t be beat . highly recommend it ! 
my friend and i had a reservation here for brunch this past saturday , and when we walked in at N N we quickly realized that we didn ' t need the reservation . this restaurant was almost completely empty , and seeing this made me get very nervous , very quickly . basically every place around my neighborhood has an hour wait for brunch , so coming into this establishment and seeing no wait made me worry about the quality of the food . my worries quickly went away upon seeing the menu and receiving my " fare " mary cocktail . it was served with plenty of accouterments - olives , bacon , celery , and lemon . the bacon was crispy and a little sweet , and the olives were so delicious i wanted a whole bowl put in front of me . the bloody mary itself was also good - nice and spicy without being overwhelming . the food was also amazing . i got the chorizo breakfast burrito . the burrito came stuffed with chorizo , sweet potatoes , spinach , egg , and flavor . it was so , so good . it also came with a side salad and even that was tasty . my friend got the caramel and banana french toast , and upon stealing a bite i immediately went into shock at how good it was . the french toast looked completely normal , but it was like there was a little bit of a sweet , crispy caramelization inside the bread . i hate frequenting places more than once , but i will have to make an exception to bring my husband here . the food was just too damn good . 
love it here ! the seafood is awesome and the ambience is unbeatable as youre right on the water . had the monkfish on special when i dined last time and it was mouthwatering good ! only complaint is that the waiters tend to try a little too hard to convey that " fancy fine dining " appeal , but you can tell it ' s a little poorly rehearsed and oozing with fake sweetness . i thought i was just being critical but t started to be annoying and my friends noticed it too . nonetheless , it ended up just providing more amusement than anything else , and the food , particularly the sushi appetizers and the seafood entrees made our dining experience just delightful . 
nyc has some pretty horrible thai food which really makes pinto stand out . i love this little joint , great authentic upscale thai . the food is delicious- the basil with tofu , ask for it extra spicy . the ambiance is cozy and cool . the wine list is limited but good and really affordable . the service is also fab . 
i ' m starting to think i need a bonnie ' s intervention . i moved into the area a few months ago and as almost immediately turned onto bonnie ' s . their burgers are great . but i ' m really impressed with their fries . they are crispy and amazing- not too thick , not too thin . i tried their beef on weck- twice . the first time i tried it , i loved it ! the next time , not so much . i ' m hoping it was just an off night or something . but the burgers are great- never once been disappointed ! 
seems pretty solid . pad thai , red curry , pineapple fried rice , and spring rolls were enjoyable and interesting enough . enjoyed this with an amazing bottle of champagne snooth . com wine pol-roge 
the staff is so pleasant and friendly . the food is delicious and full of life , even down to the pizza . this is definitely my new favorite pizzeria ! i recommend this place to anyone who loves food . N stars hands down . 
first , the fried chicken . the consistency can ' t be beat . anywhere . can ' t be beat . even the white meat is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside . the flavor is good too . but i ' ll say this i did reach for the hot sauce . which doesn ' t necessarily detract from the flavor but i have had fried chicken in the past that was spiced up so perfectly that i didn ' t even think about reaching for the hot sauce . you know . overall , the chicken is very good . four stars . next up , the collard greens . no complaints about the flavor here . real nice balance of vinegar and salt , a nice pork reduction with some meat in there , and a splash of hot sauce on top directly from the kitchen for flavor garnish . nice touch . generous helping as well . four and a half stars . the slaw . the cabbage in the slaw is chopped very finely . more so even than kfc . not stringy . stringy can be good . finely chopped is good too . great flavor . not overpowering . not too runny , not too dry . four and a half stars . the biscuit . couldn ' t . be . better . i ' m talking buttermilk and a warm oven . rub it on my face . five stars . the fried pickles . powwwww ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do it . you have to do it . fried pickle it , brother . for sure . five stars . the chocolate pudding pie . eh . whatever . masomenos . take it or leave it . two stars . the service . who cares , right ? this is w ' burg . if the service was too good we ' d get nervous . knamsayin . oh , the wine punch . or whatever it was that i got . six bucks . pretty good . just one glass . if i got too wasted there i ' d prolly do my " no ma , i swear , all i did was kiss him " joke with the mayonnaise . overall , a great place to bust a three piece and a biscuit . i ' ll be back . 
as a latino i ' ve had better spanish food . this place sucks . it ' s a perfect location for the new transplant of whites that now dominate alphabet city . don ' t waste your time coming here to find that spanish rice or tostones or bistec , you won ' t find it here as i said it caters to blanquitos latinos that don ' t know true spanish food . 
i used to love this place the husband and wife that was running it made the best pizza hands down . i went there the other day and the guy there now dropped pepperoni on the floor and picked up and put it on the pizza . i walked out without ordering . it ' s too bad im really going to miss this place . 
i was looking forward to trying this place , but was disappointed by several things . the diner itself wasn ' t very clean . when i ordered the turkey sandwich , he asked how i ' d like it cooked ( it ' s not beef ! ) i replied " all the way through , please . " scary . they seemed confused when i asked for my lunch order to-go . they weren ' t knowledgeable about the menu . getting the small cup of soup to-go adds when up-charge . the sweet potato fries were very soggy ( my drive home was N minutes . ) and halfway through my meal i found a long hair in it that wasn ' t mine . the only positive thing was being offered a glass of water while i waited . get your act together , duchess ! 
i moved from ny recently and one thing i will miss is real ny pizza . thin crust and delicious taste , i also understand it is a famous place and it is totally worth it even with the long lines . 
we went to zahov by chance on a sunday night after a movie , not knowing anything about it ahead of time . it turned out to be a great experience . the menu items were unusual to us , but the waiter was most accommodating . he explained any item we had a question about and offered recommendations . our selections were delicious ! the humus with their baked laffa bread is incredible . we especially enjoyed the crispy haloumi which was brought complimentary after they had run out of the bronzino we had selected . the customer service was extraordinary . the attention we received was unmatched . the night ended with a dessert tehina semifreddo , which was out of this world ! we can ' t wait to go back ! 
do not order from here . pizza and other products are disgusting , delivery time is way above normal times ( i live N minutes away ) it took N hr N min . i called the restaurant N times asking where my food was and was also promised that it would still be hot when it got here . it was not . 
this is not for the restaurant per se . . . but the swift and unexpectedly appreciative email that followed from a representative . i was thanked for my candor , and assured that i had menu items that have been known to be delicious , but they will give them another look , and an invite to speak personally i write reviews only when i think a meal is surprising whether it be positive or negative . its rare to get a reply , let alone one that isn ' t a blow off or overly apologetic . i ' m really impressive that they took the time , and i can honestly say i ' ll go back and replicate the meal at some point , and i really hope it outshines the first ! 
my now-husband and i have been coming to tequila ' s for a few years now , since we were just dating , and it has never failed to please . we love the dim , homey atmosphere , which is brightened entirely by the staffs ' personalities . moving on to the food and drinks , you will find that the menu appears to be smaller than it was in the past , when in reality , it ' s all of the same items , just condensed on less paper . our most recent venture included one of the specials , a crab and pineapple guacamole . if this is ever on special again , get it . giant lumps of crab meat paired with chunks of pineapple in a delicious and creamy guacamole . . . mmm , i ' m hungry all over again . from there we went with a few of our favorites the enchiladas playa for hubby , which are seafood enchiladas , and the sabana invierno de pollo for me , which is a grilled chicken breast with a layer of refried beans smeared over top with melted chihuahua cheese as the finishing layer . all the while we sipped on old favorite cocktails roses margarita for me , which is a rose infused margarita with rose petals floating inside ( it ' s yum , trust me ) , and the short rib for the man ( jalapeno-infused tequila ! ) . if you really want good mexican food and well-crafted tequila drinks , please , i beg you , try tequila ' s . i ' ve also been here for happy hours in the past , and again , they do not disappoint . you can guarantee that we will be going back to our old stomping grounds to get dinner here again . . and again . . and again . . . ! 
went with a group of N for brunch on saturday . service was so-so . we had a prix fixe menu . the chicken wings were off the hook . sweet , tangy , spicy , and a generous portion . mac and cheese - also incredible . unlimited mimosas ( for an additional N ) were nothing great , however the waiter was generous with them and constantly refilled our glasses . i had the sliders , my boyfriend had chicken and waffles with red velvet waffle -- eh , so so . nothing to rave about . was it a great time ? yes , we were there with N people , who wouldn ' t have fun ? will i go back ? no . not worth the trip from flatbush . 
pretense with a side of attitude ! awesome hostess let , s us know that the kitchen is closed N N , no problem , just want to get a drink . she says both bars are open , so we go upstairs to be greeted by pissed off waitress number one , who let ' s us know the kitchen closed at N N . no problem we would just like a few drinks . pissed off waitress number two informs us that the section we go to sit in is closed and that the kitchen closed at N N . ok , we get it , the hostess was wrong , and the waitresses are simply pissed that they are at work . oh , i should mention that this is our first visit to the city and this was our first stop . welcome to philly , no pass on continental , and go to varga ! way better service and staff and it made philly way better ! steven star , review your staff policies relating to how hospitality works or just close the place , it would be a public service either way . 
it ' s gone downhill since the owners split up . michael is doing a great job of running it , but the food quality and ambience just isn ' t the same ! the waffles are soggy now and prices for things like " toasts " have gone up . i ' m glad that the menu standards are still there , but i think this business needs some invigorating . 
i ' ve only been here twice , but both times have been a great experience . the service is on point and the burgers are one of the best i ' ve had in a long time . there are tons of different choices from the different sauces to the type of meat you want for your burger , you are sure to find it here . now , i ' m a fat kid at heart , but in order to maintain my figure ( haha ) , i have to be good and stick with the ground turkey burger . i order this in the dallas style burger which is spice crusted topped with coleslaw , monterey jack cheese , bbq sauce and pickles . perfection ! i also get the sweet potato fries with it . no words can describe the fries . you just have to get it because it ' s that good . for the sauce , i get the chipotle ketchup . it has a slight kick and goes great with the burger and fries . dip the fries in the ketchup and you get this amazing mixture of sweet , spicy , and salty . finally , to finish off my meal , i wash it down with a nice coke . . . actually , make it diet coke . i have to cut back in a few areas of the meal . burger palace . . . till we meet again ! 
i had to go here since i heard so many good things about this bakery . i got the chocolate chip cookie and chocolate almond croissant . the cookie wasn ' t soft , i wish it was more moist chewy . the croissant was flavorful but wish it had more chocolate on it . overall both were good . i ' m glad i went . 
great corner spot , love the service . . will be back ! 
i hate to be a hater but damn this place is just the pits for me . basically , the smith is a knock-off of a keith mcnally restaurant schiller ' s , balthazar , minetta tavern , pastis , lucky strike etc . the smith copied the decor pretty convincingly but the food is really bad . do yourself a favor and go to schiller ' s , lucky strike or balthazar instead . trust me . if you ' re gonna do it , do it right . 
a disappointment , considering that there are other options nearby . the hostess couldn ' t seat us in a booth ( we were two ) because they were being saved for larger parties ( it was a slow saturday ) , and we were seated alone by the window . there is a nice view of of park avenue . the waitress was slow " because she was working a party elsewhere in the restaurant " . the hamburger was passable at N ( fries are extra ) and comes with the tiniest pickle i ever saw . the turkey sandwich comes with chips and is reasonably priced . a glass of chardonnay is N or N ( they steer you toward the N ) and a small pour . there were still booths open when we left . 
i had a ravenous hunger , a hunger that could only be satisfied by the roasted meats of the combinacion de matador , or " matador combo " as it is known in the states . thankfully , my friend and business associate , john tingles the third , knew just the place to take me pio pio . this venerable pervuvian house of roasted chickens reminded me of an establishment in lima i used to frequent on my trips there for business and pleasure . pio pio has a wide variety of perennial peruvian pleasures , including an excellent ceviche however , i would look no further than the " matador combo " for a smorgasbord of intoxication . for a mere N you get a whole roasted chickens , tostones , rice and beans , a salad with avocado galore , and salchipapas , or french fries with little hot dog wieners ! the green sauce is delicious , addictive and erotic . i put it on everything , and i do mean everything . for pure value and pleasure , pio pio is one of my favorite restaurants in the city of new york . 
a -maze- zing . i was the first in line on a rainy sunday afternoon . show up N mins before door opens . and you will see the staff eat . kinda cruel and awesome at the same time . great experience and i would suggest sitting at the food bar compared to one of the few tables . they only have room for N thus the wait . -i gave the head chef a complement and he was super appreciative ! so sweet
it ' s japanese food sake heaven . i go about once a month and have never been disappointed . the wide selection of sakes don ' t hurt either ! 
amazing for dinner . also brunch ! the stuffed french toast is my favorite in the city . and the shakshuka and grilled breakfast pizza are pretty damned good too . try eating outside , inside the design isn ' t my favorite , but no worries , the food more than makes up for it . 
this is shockingly an amazing restaurant ! ! ! i didn ' t expect to have very flavorful food , but i did ! ! ! the prices are reasonably fair the amount of food i get is always more than enough . . . . ) 
i ' ve had mixed experiences with the jose garces restaurants ( garces trading co . and distrito were positive , amada and chifa were not ) but tinto is by far my favorite . we ate here for their don quioxte dinner , N dishes and N wine pairings . every dish was cooked perfectly creative ingredients and flavor combinations . first experience with rare squab and it was phenomenal . great service . staff is very knowledgeable . i will definitely come back here again to experience their standard menu . 
love it ! i have been waiting for six years for a place like this to open up in montclair . this is the best coffee shop in town . the coffee is delicious . the pastries are also so yummy . and the food . . . ! there are so many great options . my kids love it ! the service is friendly . they will even modify dishes for my kids , basically making something not on the menu that my kids will eat . the atmosphere is relaxed . i highly recommend a trip to red eye ! 
if you are in nyc and looking for the greatest sushi experience of your life then go to momo sushi shack . you will be dreaming about the food and the owner phillip forever after . must trys the nigiri set pork betty fried chicken ( seriously the most savory delicious japanese fried chicken i ' ve ever had ) also ask for the best cold sake they have by the glass or bottle and you ' re in for a treat , even if you ' re not normally a sake fan . go go go go go . and tell phillip i love him ! 
don ' t think you can really call this a panini if it ' s not even warm or hot . . . it tasted like a subway sandwich . it was huge . . . like a mini-sized baby . i don ' t think that one person can finish an entire one . it was definitely filling , but the ingredients didn ' t really excite me much . i ' d rather pay for the better quality than just large quantity . won ' t come back here unless i am beasting hungry . 
yesterday , july Nst , N friends and i went to il corallo for lunch before going to the yankee game later that night . we all had the green salad for starters and then ordered our own pizzas . the salad was very good , and the dressing and olives really set off the taste . we ordered the traditional red pizza with cheese , which was outstanding , the pizza with peppers , sun dried tomatoes and sausage , which was also delicious , and the pizza verde with zucchini , asparagus , goat cheese , basil , oregano , and cheese , which was also very good . this is one of my favorite restaurants in soho , and the service , food , ambiance , and staff are wonderful . 
i stopped going to patsy ' s in midtown ( the high-priced sit down place in midtown , not the much better pizza place ) because the quality has slipped so much . a client who has a table at rao ' s brought me here and i discovered this fantastic treasure ! everything that patsy ' s falls short on is done to perfection at rao ' s . the sauce is as good as the homemade that my mother used to make . the veal cutlets , my favorite , are tender and fresh . the pasta is served hot , hot , hot and not lukewarm because i think they make it fresh to order . the atmosphere is home , not tacky and pretentious like patsy ' s and a few other highfalutin ' italian restaurants in midtown are . if you ever have the chance get into rao ' s . it ' s not easy but it ' s well worth the wait
i ' m pretty apathetic about sushi and still loved my experience at izumi . first of all , it ' s byob . second , it ' s a nice atmosphere and somewhat upscale , which is not always the case with byob ' s . we went with a big group of seven and were struggling about how much to order , what to pick etc . our waiter gave us a couple typical options , then offered to just select dishes for us and course it out - he promised to be fair with portions prices , which i was pretty skeptical about , but it turned out amazing . he brought a sashimi appetizer , gyoza , tuna with avocado ponzu sauce ( excellent ) , a selection of maki ( there was a special monster roll with soft shell crab on top that was great ) , then finally a selection of sashimi . it ' s not exactly what we would ' ve ordered had we just done it ourselves , but everything was delicious and we each ended up paying around N . not tons of food , but definitely enough . not bad at all
phenomenal ! some of the best food in the world . it ' ll get a little expensive ( N for N perogies ? ! ) but i guess you get what you pay for . 
brought my friend here last friday for dinner and she agreed that this place rocks . as my second time here , i knew what to expect-- good , homemade , polish food in generous portions for dirt cheap . and it ' s byob-- no charge on " corkage fee " . we shared the kielbasa and stuffed cabbage meal which came with our selected sides of sauerkraut , red cabbage and cucumber salad . stuffed and satisfied , the meal came out to a mere N ( including tax ) . add tip and two bottles of polish beef from nearby liquor store and you have a N- N dinner for two . what restaurant can top that ? 
i was quite underwhelmed for this meal . for every dish i had , i can name something similar that was made better eaten recently . but trying to remember the dishes i had just after eating there a week ago is incredibly hard . . . which i guess says something but nevertheless i will try . the amuse was a gazpacho with i believe shrimp and some kind of sorbet . i understand the amuse is suppose to tickle your mouth and wake it up and the best way to do that is by using citrus . but this gazpacho was a bit too tart , compared to a similar amuse a l ' atelier which was in my opinion more refined . my app was the steamed egg . it was probably the best dish of the night so no complaints there . my main was the baby pig and compared that to the suckling pig i had a the modern the week before , it paled in comparison . first the skin was not as crispy as i would have liked , thus making the cutting of it , with a rather dull knife , a much harder task than it should have been . the plating was also rather dull . the dessert , brioche , was way too sweet . it actually reminded me of the dessert truck ' s bread pudding which was more refined also , the petite fours offered only had one piece each for a table of four . this meant that not everyone at our table can try everything . i didn ' t quite understand the point of that . oh , and the decor seemed really out dated with the red , arching ceilings . i didn ' t feel comfortable . . . almost a little claustrophobic . i guess i tend to lean toward contemporary settings . ok , as to not make this restaurant sound like a complete failure , keep in mind , these are all opinions . i also had huge expectations considering this is a N star michelin restaurant . so to end on a positive note , the fig bread was also awesome . definitely get that . 
i wanted a light dinner so i ordered a cup of chicken soup and quinoa cakes . the chicken soup had hardly any meat but nicely flavored broth . the quinoa cakes were ok but not worth getting again . will not be returning bc whole foods across the street is a much better option ! 
great place to get drinks with friends . we prefer to sit outside . quiet with a cozy ambiance . i never ate here but it looks good . the drinks a big and reasonably priced . get there early to get seats . . . 
there are not many authentic greek restaurants in ct so thank goodness there is cavos ! the wonderful thing we discovered was the list of N to N mezes on sundays . perhaps the special prices are to entice people to come in on dead summer sundays . they were small plates but very filling . we liked the garlicy potato dip ( skordalia ) , feta , olives , grilled calamari , spanakopita , pita and especially the very garlicy tzatziki . but i was disappointed with the unseasoned fried bacalao . we only had room in our bellies for N-N entrees . so we ordered the huge mixed grill platter of meats with rice ( the order came out wrong with fries ) . the gyro meat , chicken kabobs , and lamb chops were salty but delicious . grilled shrimps were ehh . the moussaka which looked like lasagna , but made with potato and eggplant could ' ve used some seasonings . the salad and lemon orzo soup , accompanying the entrees , were very good . we had ordered the house special pizza as well but it never came . the waitress admitted she forgot to put the order in and was only reminded of it when she was taking someone else ' s order . it was a blessing in disguise really , because we were so stuffed . ( deja vu . . . why don ' t our waitresses write things down ! ) at the end , we shared the baklava and galactoburiko for desserts . yummy as always . not happy that during mezes , a spider decided to crawl along the wall right by our heads . we brought that to our waitress ' s attention since it decided to fall in the glass of water . she was also very slow in filling our glasses with water . our poor friend just came from surviving the all day warped tour , but he looked iike he just crawled across the sahara ! besides the little mishaps we still had a great meal . i will dream about the tzatziki tonight ! 
the best selection of draft beer in nh . especially good at happy hour when they are all half price . a mature crowd frequents this authentic looking bar . uniquely tasty burgers and friendly staff . 
this place is fantastic . the quality of the ingredients and dishes are always great . the high quality portions are also great for the price - other restaurants of comparable quality would be much more expensive elsewhere . very cosy ambiance and the staff is very attentive and professional . 
i love the name ! it seems like it has something to do with kosher food
certainly it ' s not worth the hype , especially their burger , primehouse , abc kitchen , wolfgangs even peter lugers with their terrible service are better options when it comes to burger . the place looks great though , and it has a good vibe during prime hours . 
i love coming here . my boyfriend and i have been fans for awhile now . i think their food is very good . i only had one issue , my boyfriend did not care for the meatballs . he said they were comparable to frozen meatballs you can get in the grocery store . prices are fair . service is generally very good . this place is always busy , especially on the weekends , so i highly recommend making reservations if you plan to eat here . parking can be tight on the weekends as well . the main dining area has the tendency to get rather loud when it ' s a full house . i would not recommend coming here for a quiet romantic dinner . however cafe antonio is very nice , quiet , and romantic if you come for a later dinner during the week . i have never ordered food from their " pizza shop " side although i hear it ' s very good . cafe antonio is a must if you are in the area and looking for some great food ! remember this restaurant is byob , so make sure you bring your own ) 
pies n thighs is a wonderful place to eat with friends . i ' ve been here twice and both times i loved the food and the service that i received . the first time i went was during their lunch dinner hours and i ordered the fried chicken box ( three pieces of friend chicken ) with a side of macaroni and cheese . i loved the chicken-it was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of crunch that i love in fried chicken . the mac-n-cheese wasn ' t exactly " my cup of tea , " but i know a lot of people enjoy their take on the classic american side dish . it has a creamier taste than i desired i ' m more into a cheesier baked version of the dish . the second time i went to pies n thighs was during their brunch hour and i ordered a chicken biscuit with some home fries . the chicken biscuit was nothing short of amazing ! i really loved the spicy kick of the chicken filet and the honey butter placed on the chicken was awesome . the home fries was a twist from the usual home fries i have had in the past . it was made of red russet potatoes with a wonderful hint of rosemary . it was both light and delightfully refreshing . i must say that one of the best things you could order here is their banana cream pie ! it is everything . if you go here , do yourself a favor and order yourself a slice . i love this place and plan on going back . 
the pizza and appetizers were unmemorable and the environment a bit like an upscale sportsbar but when we were told to leave our table as others were waiting ( though we had not lingered , had already paid , and were finishing our drinks ) we all decided never to return . seriously ? what restaurant does that ? it ' s inexcusable to value turnover more than people , particularly when the food is not worthy . 
excellent margherita pizza . great crisp tender crust . nice sauce . burrata pizza very rich with spicy porkey sauce . grilled octopus tender though some what sandy . go all in with pizzas . nutella with strawberry and marshmallow pizza unique and loved by the kids . 
i ' ll throw in my N cents sure . . . even if you ' re vegetarian or whatnot , you may love this place . i don ' t eat sushi , but the other stuff i had was good ' nuff . i used to live on the next block right before they made this joint , and everyone ' s right in that it ' s a gem in an area with few places to get food aside from snatch . the owners are darlings too , as many know ) they want you to have the best time possible , with the best food possible , and it shows ! deeliteful
cute lil mexican restaurant in hoodside woodside . this neighborhood is gettin trendier and trendier . food was nice . i enjoyed the chicken tamale . good subtle flavor . the scallop ceviche was refreshing . my beef carne burrito was stuffed with meat and rice and all the good fixings . very cute and friendly waitress . prices are all good . complete dinner for N came out to N bucks . 
i waited to visit twice before reviewing , because unlike some people , i ' d prefer to make sure that my experience is consistent before giving either a thumbs up or down . my first visit was last week , and i came with three friends to check out the " bar scene " . first off the bar tenders are extremely knowledgeable and friendly . if you love beer like i do and want to talk about the nuances of different varieties of beer , then pull up a chair because these guys know their stuff . we basically tried every beer they have via the samplers , which was a lot of fun . . . . they have quite a few haha . our bartenders name was sam and he could talk beer all night . very passionate about what he does . we also ate the chicken bites which were obviously not the frozen pre-packed junk you get at the corporate hell food everywhere else in williston , and the grilled wings were the simply the best wings i have ever eaten . the margarita pizza was really good and the tomatoes were extremely fresh and tasty , but i think it could have used a bit of salt and they forgot the basil . that would have dropped this review to N stars , but remember , this is based on two visits , not one . my second visit , i came with the wife and kids last saturday at Npm . the place was absolutely packed and i was disheartened to see a line out the door , but they seated us within N minutes and even brought out some of those chicken bites for people to munch on while they were waiting . classy move ! ! ! i ' ve never seen another restaurant do this and it was much appreciated . like i said , the place was packed and definitely got a bit noisy . personally , i don ' t mind that and like the energy it gives , but if you are looking for a quiet-intimate setting for a hand-holding date then you might not like it for that . but for a fun time with lots of action and energy , this is a good thing . we had the house salad which was very fresh and well dressed the balsamic dressing is da bomb ! we also had two orders of thai wings ( because i loved them so much last time ) and they were even better than before . . . i didn ' t think that was possible . also had a buffalo chicken pizza which was fantastic , and the spinach artichoke dip . everything was very fresh and had that " home made " quality to it . i was a little bit surprised that they didn ' t have a kids menu , until i realized that there was no need pizza , chicken bites , steak and cheese or chicken parmessian sandwiches . . . meatballs . . . what could be more " kid friendly " than all of that ? smart menu design . bottom line i challenge you to find better food or a better beer selection in williston . can ' t be done . chilis ? nope . longhorn ? uh , nope . three tomatoes ? don ' t make me laugh . i hope the tap house is here for a long long time because williston has needed a place like this and i couldn ' t be happier . 
the pizza was hot and tasty . however , i did get sick the next day . may have been coincidence but i ' m probably not going to eat there again . 
get the air conditioning fixed . the place is too hot and the a c does not work . it was cooler outside then inside the restaurant on july Nth . management should do something to fix this
great food ! especially the pulled chicken sandwiches ! excellent service too . anytime i needed a napkin , fork or more water - a waitress was right there ! cant wait to go again
first time i had banh mi sandwhich here , it had the little crispy bbq pork ha , love viet sandwhich and this place makes it good . i came after N once and they sold out o o wth ? i would go back for the bbq pork , but they could use some work on the bread , and hold the mayo . 
ordered takeout . . . my wife had the hacked chicken and wanton szechuan style . last night was the worst night of her life . i don ' t want to describe everything she went through but it has all the signs of food poisioning . it ' s now N oclock the following day and she still can ' t get out of bed . we certainly won ' t be going back for their " award winning chinese cuisine " . 
i almost gave up going here because finding this place was so frustrating . once i finally found it though , i really dug its funky alleyway and the rustic , log-cabin decor . we had the poached eggs w cheddar cheese grits and raised waffle for brunch . simple food , some might even say bland , but i though both were pretty good . other menu items being served around us seem to be worth trying out too . only complaint would be the food is a little pricey for the modest portions served and the place seems to be infested with hipsters . 
came here today with my brother for lunch after attending a taping of a tv show . i ' ve been reading up on the yelp reviews for this place and decided to order the following foods -kobe beef burgers these were great and delicious . it ' s a huge burger made with kobe beef and an assortment of different toppings that they put on top . it ' s a bit pricy ( N ) , but trying kobe beef for the first time , this wasn ' t bad at all . the beef was quite juicy and flavorful and made perfectly . it paired well with the toppings and condiments they add and well worth the money ! - spider roll i have to say , this was probably one of the freshest and flavorful sushi made to order at the spot . it was filled with soft shell crab , avocado , carrot , cucumber , etc . and it was delicious . -tempura sweet potato fries these paired so well with the wasabi mayo or teriyaki ketchup the restaurant has for you to dip in . i definitely recommend the wasabi mayo if you wish to have an extra " zing " to your palate ! must try wasabi mayo ! ! it is made perfectly not too strong that you have a sinus overreaction or a crying fit , but not at all bland that you taste air . dip your fries in this , swab some over your burger , or spread it over the sushi - it ' s a must-do ! ! all in all , the ambience and decor of the restaurant were cozy and sort of homelike . it wasn ' t loud with cacophonous music or filled with rude people it was a calm place , quiet at times , and i saw different customers working on homework work , catching up with friends , on a date , alone , etc . so , this place is really a go-to place for all types of occasions ( except groups , they have booth seats and bar seats which don ' t fit a large group of people ) . the service was good also the kitchen crew were very friendly and accommodating in the brief interaction i had with them while waiting for my food ( i had asked for a takeout box for my leftovers ) . i ' d definitely come back here in the future to try their other sushi rolls and burgers , and possibly their ramen bowls ! great food and great service here ! 
grilled sardines ! don ' t eat the bones . 
beware of an angry , nasty chef owner , anthony , who is more interested in money than customers ! hope his food isn ' t as acidic as his attitude ! he just ruined our christmas dinner . i purchased a groupon for N worth of food , only after i purposely questioned groupon if i could use it for catered trays or take out there was no fine print on cielo ' s deal saying dine in only or not good on holidays and groupon assured me i could use it . i placed my order with cielo and they were fine and accommodating until i mentioned the groupon . i was yelled at and told they would not honor the groupon for take out , especially near a holiday , and that it says that on the groupon . i tried to tell him it doesn ' t say that and groupon assured me of that and he yelled you should have asked me and hung up . sounds like their problem is with the groupon company but they had no problem losing me or any of my network as customers , let alone leaving us without christmas dinner ! bah humbug ! ! 
best chicken parm ever . . . i take that back best everything ever
don ' t use open table here , they take reservations but don ' t honor them . showed up after making an online rez , was told it would take at least an hour to seat us . no apologies . no offer to buy a round of drinks , or apps , or whatever else it is you do when you ' re in the service industry and screw up . yeah , we didn ' t stick around . 
beware ! lui lui has a menu which appears to make them a gluten intolerant friendly restaurant . many of their items are indicated as being able to be made gluten free , including pasta dishes that can be prepared with gluten free pasta . yet , they are careless in preparation ! today i ordered a gluten free pasta dish and ate several bites . after ten years with celiac disease i have a good feel for the texture of gluten free items , i had my doubts about this dish from the being . of course , my entree was not made gluten free . the restaurant was then basically indifferent about my plight offering me a free dessert to make up for their mistake ( great , since i ' m already sick ! ) . they then proceeded to charge me for the meal ! of course , they had brought me a replacement " gluten free " meal that had crunchy and undercooked pasta . in summary , if you are gluten intolerant do not trust the kitchen at lui lui . 
i sooo wanted to like this place , we were excited for it to open forever , but it was a huge letdown . i got the southwest mac , N . N , and an appetizer of peppers with aioli , N . N . i didn ' t think the flavors were bad , but the portion sizes were insanely small for what they are charging ! ( N tiny piquillo peppers for N . N is way too much , even for montclair , and the mac and cheese container was only a quarter full ) . i ' d go to cars for mac and cheese before returning , better portions and less money , but i ' d be willing to give them another shot if i start to see the reviews improving . i did go the first day they opened so i ' m hoping they just need to work out some kinks . 
it ' s still the best ramen i ' ve had in the city . . . but thank heavens it ' s in the east village , of else i wouldn ' t know what to do with the an hour and a half long wait on a friday night ! . . . but then again , sucks that it ' s in the east village , because all you see around are tempting food joints and bars ! they have never let me down with the food , but this time , i ordered a cherry blossom , which tasted like cough syrup i had to return it for a regular glass of plum wine ( we were seated exactly N . N hours later at a long table and there was this point of time that i was sooooo appalled by this girl and her boyfriend who were sitting across from us . . . . she poured her water into her akamaru ramen ! ! ! . . . . why ? because she thought the broth was too hot ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? omg , omg omg . . i didn ' t now what to say , but i knew i had to say something ! ! . . . . i opted for " i can ' t believe you just did that ! " anyhow , still the best ramen in the city ! 
such a nice little set for lunch . more than enough food to keep you full ! i got the ume and sweet potato onigiri and the tofu gnocchi miso soup . everything was delicious and flavorful ! i loved the pickled side dishes too . amazing service , very friendly waitresses and great open and inviting interior space to relax and have lunch ! 
delicious and ridiculously inexpensive . a bit crammed , but they operate quickly to keep things moving . 
oxtail ragu was definitely amazing as others have already written . i , however , enjoyed the special of the day even more ! it was a jumbo shrimp seafood pasta but a light , creamy type of sauce . it was delicious ! very affordable italian restaurant ! would def recommend it . 
quiet restaurant the escargot was delicious . the tables are very close so you feel on top of your neighbors . overall , excellent experience . the two appetizers we got , the goat cheese tart and the mussels in a curry broth , were fantastic . we messed up on the entree . we got the duck , which was fine , but i regret not getting one of the signature dishes , either the filet with foie gras or the cassoulet . the profiteroles were a nice enough way to end dinner . a nice note on the place is that it is byob , so you won ' t have to overpay for a nice bottle of vino ! 
one of my favorite lunch places in the west westttt village . i can imagine they have a great brunch also . the daily specials are always good and you can bet they have a tasty soup especially in the winter , that will hit the spot . must haves artichoke appetizer ( comes with two sauces that are both delicious ) , tomato soup , falafel , baba , the chicken kebab special and my absolute favorite , the ahi tuna and preserved lemon sandwich ( which is better without the bread actually ) . they make a good harissa too , that you can put on anything . 
after having an otherwise great meal we ordered the salmon pot pie and found it to be undercooked . the salmon was also a bit off or old and after bringing it to the servers attention we were pretty much told that ' s the way it is and that we were stuck with it . she was rude and didn ' t even listen to our concern 
i got their curry with brown rice and pork katsu added on top ! it was pretty delicious , mmmm . not much else to say-it ' s a cute tiny spot that probably seats less than ten people inside . i ' ll have to try their ramen next , when i ' m in the area ! ! 
amazing food ! my mouth is watering just thinking about that chili cheese burger . yummmm
best burger , really ! and it ' s verrrry big ! 
give it a try , guarantee the tempting taste will satisfy your appetite . 
drinks are pretty good but the food is just average . atmosphere is very nice . staff are great ! 
i came here with a friend and must say the food was great ! the lemon chicken was delicious but the sheep milk dumplings were out of this world . the server anna talked me into trying this and offered an exceptional wine to go with it . anna really knows her stuff and made my dining experience the best i ever had . i will surely be going back and take any more recommendations from anna . 
worst ever experience in an indian restaurent . food was unhygienic . . . . . forget about the taste . . . service was too lame . . . and they forced us to pay N tips
i ' m just a couple a blocks from this establishment and it was a refreshing addition to the community . i ' m not a daily meat eater anymore so this is a fabulous spot to eat in . the food is satisfying but not heavy and the flavors are fresh and i can have all my veggies . they also have smoothies to enjoy . 
on april the N i was invited to this gorgeous restaurant . the enviroment is cozy and the music was great cuban music . sangaria is something tasty and the various food led by great hosting and serving was highly efficient and pleasent . great . 
my favorite dessert is hands down red velvet cake , and to this day the best rvc i ' ve had is in the famous junior ' s bakery . the slices are dense , gigantic , and worth every cent and second it takes to indulge . each visit to nyc has to be topped with a visit to their bakery as well ! i would definitely recommend visiting at least the bakery to any tourist looking for something sweet and symbolic of nyc . 
we like this place a lot . its a good place to go , lively atmosphere , always packed , and outdoor seating . you cannot go wrong with the food . the bread they bring to the table is fresh and delicious , their mac and cheese is made with cavettelli ( sp ? ) and is delicious , their french onion soup is great ( but extremely pricey for what it is ) , the oysters were tastey , and the steak frites entre was a very good hanger steak . we have been here a few times and will continue to come back why its not a N ? even with reservations , we waited N minutes to be seated ( and we came early ) . also prices for what you get is off for some items . the french onion soup is around N bucks ! --its good but not double as good as most other places for N bucks . the steak was very tiny for N buck meal . but inverse , the mac and cheese is N bucks for a good portion . 
tibetan food shows a major influence of indian and chinese methods of cooking but yak in the other hand shows no type of excellence . i read many reviews of yak before going to eat there and thought the food would be mind blowing . i was very disheartened because i was looking for real tibetan food which reminded me of my home land . the food chayley also known as beef tongue tasted stale and gummy . the rest of meal was very spicy and very oily or shall i say very greasy i had to order atleast N sodas because it was spicy . i know that the food is suppose to be spicy but if its to spicy the flavor of the food becomes spoiled and you cant enjoy the meal . waiters and waitress were everywher they seem to be lost but friendly . it took them about N min ' s just for them to bring out my soup . which tasted like milk and corn being warmed up . the decoration wasn ' t that bad . but i feel like they should reduce the spice and cook fresh food and not be giving customers stale food . after all we are paying for the food and i don ' t want to pay for a food that i have chances of getting sick with . the music or live band was very annoying it sounded like someone crying . they should try tib chants or inspiration songs that are more likely to smooth customers . i think i ' ll go back if ever decide to eat oily and very spicy food . but as for now i don ' t think so . 
great assortment of markets , breakfast lunch dinner treat spots , and other various stores . where else can you get soul food , crepes , cheesesteaks , ice cream , chinese , seafood , and pumplecake ( pies baked into a two layer cake - visit the flying monkey ) ? almost every type of food you can think of is here , which makes it great for groups , tourists , and out of town friends . what doesn ' t make it group friendly is how crowded it can get during peak times . seating is limited , and much of it is reserved for patrons of a particular shop . they do put some tables outside when it ' s warm , so try to snag one of those and escape the craziness . some things are overpriced , but some of ridiculously cheap . you just have to know where to go . iovine bros produce is one of the cheaper ones , with most of it ' s offering hovering around N lb . if you ' re looking for a deal , come right before closing when the vendors are packing up . places like famous Nth st cookies offer ' dollar holler " where all cookies are N towards the end of the day . 
a top nyc dining experience , without being pretentious . located in the heart of the west village , this restaurant is one you will definately want a return visit to . the atmosphere , service , and especially the food are just downright spot-on ! make a reservation in advance . 
excellent price for delicious sandwiches , everything is so fresh ! my first time here was last thursday and i had the french goat cheese sandwich , the sweet of the figs was just perfect . i will be a regular here for sure , thank god is just a block from my work . 
i am in love with this little polish deli that is a breeze to swing by and quickly park in front of as you travel down rte . N , located right in the parking lot by boonton lanes . the homemade polish recipes seem to be family favorites and the signature soups are outstanding . subtle hints of dill accompany a rich tomato soup ( that my girls and i die for ) , the cabbage-and-kielbasa soup is light and satisfying , while the chicken noodle soup is the best of its kind . the chef is a kind polish woman who runs her own shop along with her three cool kids . . they seem to be filmmakers , photographers , musicians , and one is a pilot . . . a real renaissance family . can you tell i go there a lot and talk a bit too much ? hidden among the polish groceries , deli " to-go " foods , bakery treats , and threadbare decor is the true time capsule of hipster cred an old vinyl record player . i turned my girls onto the beatles there , and their music collection is quite eclectic and nostalgic ( the kinks , the clash , the bee gees ? mom and kids have differing musical tastes . . . ) don ' t miss your chance to swing by and try the best kielbasa ( and i ' ve tried so many ) , yummy pierogies , and delicious mushroom-and-gravy meatballs . or just a quick , simple deli sandwich . they do it all , and there is usually a table for you . 
the food was actually ok , but nothing to write home about . i ordered the buffalo chicken wrap platter . the portion was large , however did not match the description . the platter is supposed to come with the wrap , fries , and coleslaw . there was a wrap ( extremely messy and hard to eat ) , there were fries , the " coleslaw " was actually lettuce , tomatoes , and pickles . . . not exactly my idea of coleslaw . to top it off . . the driver forgot the calzone my roommate ordered and had to drive back to the restaurant , pick it up , then bring it back , this was after waiting over an hour for a half hour delivery . not exactly ideal . 
i ' ve only been here for brunch . they have delicious , and very reasonably priced brunch options . try to the escarcots , and the croque madame . service is extremely friendly , especially the manager . they have a bottomless ( mimosa ) special , but if you pull the manager ' s arm , he might extend that to their bloody mary ' s , which are delicious . busy , but not packed at brunch . 
guilty ! i discovered gaia ( the cafe and the lady ) many weeks ago , quite by accident , just walking down houston , seeking food , and after a wonderful ' tasting menu ' exploration ( my gf and i tried everything we could could possibly manage without bursting ) . . . exceptional . almost no ' official ' atmosphere , and yet , utterly authentic , real , italian . not shabby , but almost like found art - none of your food money has been spent making the place fancy but gaia is wonderful , and having given them a huge tip on a tiny bill ( and still a huge bargain ) my guilt is in having told gaia i was going to review her on yelp , and then neglected to do so - lots of travel , work , etc . but now , having a reservation for tomorrow , i could not go back without telling the truth - though i don ' t really know her , i love gaia ( ( the cafe and the lady ) and now my guilt is in telling the world , and knowing i ' ll never be able to find a spare chair there again , sigh , but , i owe it to her , and my sense of fairness . my gf and i are parted . . . gee , i wonder if gaia would consider marrying me ? love harvey
went for dinner . great addition to neighborhood . goof food good drinks friendly service ! will certainly return . 
excellent place . i would have made the trip from manhattan ( yay ! ) to astoria ( uch ) sooner had my fianc explained this restaurant better . she called it a " diner . " yes- it ' s N hours . yes- it ' s fairly inexpensive . yes- it ' s owned by greeks . but that ' s really it . the menu should probably be categorized as " diner inspired fare . " the menu is also far more streamlined and condensed than the average diner . it doesn ' t even look much like a diner . i recommend ordering the way we did last night- order a bunch of appetizers to share . everything was a winner with the fried ravioli and crunchy ranch ( chicken ) quesadilla standing out a bit . pretty good service , too . we ' ll return , for sure . 
hmm . N reviews so far ? that is about how many people were in line for pizza the night i broke my artichoke cherry . seriously . i still can ' t believe we waited in line for N minutes for drunk pizza . good thing i had some philosophizing to do with a certain person . if you live on Nth street near artichoke , i wholeheartedly apologize if my yelling about racism and culturally competent language woke you up at Nam . i am so not a fan of people that use derogatory language , and apparently this particularly saturday night included a lot of derogatory language . and i had to step up and put a certain person in his place . i ' m so sure the other N people waiting in line for their drunk pizza found our conversation either a ) amazingly entertaining or b ) downright obnoxious . either way , the conversation made my N-minute wait for this divine pizza fly by like whoa . and once i put the deliciously dripping pizza in my mouth i was in pizza heaven , and nothing else mattered . i ate the whole slice and half of another one . i ate the rest of the second slice for breakfast the next morning . and then that night i dreamed of artichokes and spinach dip and pizza . it was amazing . 
this is my second time at this place and i have to say that i enjoyed it more than the first time now that i tried the chicken nanban . it ' s really good ! i had the kobe dish last time which was pretty good but overpriced so it left a bad impression on me . this experience was much better . 
great food , great pickles , fantastic service . i came here when it wasn ' t too busy , which sounds like a good time to do that . they also have a huge beer selection . only downside is it ' s slightly more expensive than it should be , but still lots of fun . 
i am a regular to pho N being a p w vet outta eh , but i don ' t go to N for the ambiance , and you have to understand the flow and expectations . they don ' t open on monday so don ' t make this mistake . also if you come after N N on tuesday , be prepared to wait outside for at least N minutes . it is worth the wait for the soup alone , and that ' s pretty much all you are getting unless you also want a mostly lettuce and few shrimp " spring roll " but this is not the typical chinese fried version . the place is family run , and if you know the owner and treat them kindly they are great people . know that the menu basically is small , medium , or large with medium being more than sufficient for the larger of appetite ( N . N is more than fair for the quality of soup ) add your favorite condiment my preference is hardcore heat with plenty of the standard sriracha sauce ( facebook . com l . php ? u htt ) and ask for a special vietnamese ground pepper flake and oil , and a thai dragon pepper . add a dash of fish oil sauce . if you don ' t sweat you aren ' t eating pho properly d pho N ' s location isn ' t great nor is their parking adequate , most i can suggest is just being patient . weekends the menu changes to spicy beef on saturday and chicken soup for sunday . they will run out of soup on the weekend , and unless you are a local , i would strongly urge avoiding the place unless its for lunch during the week . they do a very good take out business as well , but would suggest unless you are going to eat it within the next hour , that you instead tell them that you are going to prepare it at home tonight for dinner , and they will give you directions and a special bag with everything you need to make it at home . its not the same , but its still good if you need your fix . if you are a fan of pho and are in connecticut , then pho N possibly is the best bet of the ones i ' ve tried , just know that ' s why you are going and you should be good d
i love the food here , the service is great , and the location is fantastic . the new space is just gorgeous ! i ' m thrilled the new location is so close to home . . my family and i will be regulars ! ! ! this is definitely a must try ! ! 
i love this place . finally we have a very cool , trendy , fancy , restaurant in ditmars area . great food , very affordable , awesome service . great bar . hot crowd . i had a great time . nice and healthy food . i ' ll be back . thank you . ! ! ! 
the atmosphere was good the drinks were perfect the clam pie was almost as good as lee ' s tavern . the waitress were polite , and attentive . 
really enjoyed th baked goods . a large variety , moist and flavorful . we usually over order and then freeze what we don ' t eat right away
i work close by so this is the go to spot for group lunches . the entree ' s are always great ! the service has been good every time and there is typically no wait to be seated . some of the hits mac cheese , swordfish , roasted chicken ( amazing ! ! ! ) , green beans , roasted butternut squash soup , most of the cocktails some of the misses wine list ( served warm too ) the decor is very nice in my opinion . . . kinda rustic and log cabin like . in the back there is a room lit with red lights two couches , a chair or two and a pool table . seems like a great place to go for dinner with a group of friends and have a little fun without being at a bar . i ' ll definitely be going back . 
the hype surrounding this restaurant only made our mediocre experience more disappointing . we love great food and were really hoping this place would land on our favs list . unfortunately , it did not . a couple comments first on the decor , since many others have mentioned it . we used to frequent the restaurant when it was washington square and thought the layout , outside of some upgraded cosmetics , did not appear signficantly different . this is not to say that the atmosphere is unenjoyable ( it is ) . at least they retained the best elements of the prior place . but now to the food . the first course was good -- a tasty veal sweetbread . i do not eat them often enough to be an expert , but enjoyed it nonetheless . we ordered a lobster pie and a lamb dish for the main courses . the first big complaint -- barely warm food . the server did not come back to check on our meals so we had no opportunity to express our issue . they were cold before we could finish them . but even if the food would have been warmer , the actual taste was unexceptional . the lobster pie sauce was fairly bland , although the crust was enjoyable . the lamb was similarly bland and , strangely enough , overdone . its accompanying squash was not cooked enough . we had the cheese plate for dessert , which was the highlight of the evening . the pairings were well-chosen and the layout of the cheeses carefully thought , so that the most intense flavors were at the end . this exceptional cheese plate prevented a one-star rating . we ' re willing to give the place another try , but with its steep cost we ' re definitely going to try some other options in town first . 
dismayed by lack of service at the vault , we enjoyed the guitar player singer service at the continental . returned during the week for happy hour ( good value ) and a great pulled-pork sandwich . major change from the continental " back in the day " . . . well done ! 
my favorite falafel joint in brooklyn , bar none . i love their falafel and shawarma everything ! sometimes if i ' m extra hungry , i ' ll eat the platter , which comes with everything that is found in the sandwich on a plate with humus and baba ganoush . oh , it also comes with the pita ! it ' s super delicious and enough to share with a friend . oh , ask for hot sauce ! 
went to black bear with friends for lunch on a busy friday and all i can say is yea ! the wait staff was superb . the turkey burger wrap i ordered was perfect ! parking was easy , well this time it was . i ordered the pint of guinness to drink and it was delicious . i would recommend coming at lunch time the crowd is more professionals on there lunch hour . at night time its a younger crowd . add black bear to your hartford lunch spots you ' ll be glad you did . 
delicious ! this is some of the best food i ' ve had in a long while . go there if you can stand the wait and hipper than thou attitude . 
if you love to try different varieties of beer , you will enjoy their selections . i have to say i wish their menu would have more varieties like their beer . i only would come here for burgers and mussels . that is why i am giving it a N stars . i like varieties and the prices is quite high here so is really a place that i go for a treat . 
bleu sushi was great . food was fresh and delicious . the prices were better than we had expected for the neighborhood . hendra was a nice host and his staff were super friendly . i will definitely go back . 
the entrees , tapas , and drinks are phenomenal ! the sunday suckling pig is tasty . there hasn ' t been a dish here that i ' ve tried that i found unsatisfactory . i could go every week . 
burger baby has to step it up several notches . they do not compare to max burger or plan b as plan b by far is thumbs up . the add on for duck fries additional ( really ) if this is what you are known for they should not be an add on . also the regular fries soggy . waited about a half hour for the waitress to return with water and when reminded she brought two glasses . that i took as don ' t bother me i brought you two as i ' m busy . she never returned to ask how things were as she was busy preparing the other tables for the next business day . this was not a busy night . never mentioned the bacon was breaded . for the price and location they really need some improvement . 
it is a unique concept where you pick everything to build your own dinner . i put risotto under spicy pork meatballs with a tomato gravy on top . it was delicious . my girl made a vegeterian meatball hero with a pesto sauce . the sides were just as good . we finished off with a build your own ice cream sandwhich . the atmosphere was fun and the service was adequate . 
i used to order from here all the time when i lived in bayonne . it was by far the best pizzeria around . all of their food is excellent ! the grilled chicken wrap is delicious ! ! ! i ' ve also ordered the cavatelli with broccoli and the chicken parm dinner . my husband loves the stromboli ! ! ! my brother still lives there and he orders so often they know his phone number when he calls , he doesn ' t even have to give them his address ! ! ! my parents knew the original owners and when the new owners came in they didn ' t change a thing ! ! ! smartest thing they could have done ! ! ! 
you have to order the fish tacos . some of the best i ' ve had . the guacamole is also great , good spice with freshly made chips . drinks were great and the staff were extremely friendly . smaller place , we got stuck behind a pretty obnoxious group . however , after a couple jalapeno margaritas i felt right at home . 
needed to catch up with an old friend and decided to get thai food . i looked on yelp and saw that ngam had really good reviews overall from fellow yelpers . we decided to order the appetizer platter for two which included the chiang mai fries , grilled squid , spicy kale salad , and spring rolls . i liked the chiang mai fries but i can barely taste that it ' s pumpkin if i didn ' t read it from the menu . my friend thought the squid was rather chewy but i found mine to be tender and cooked just right . the spring rolls were a tad bit spicy for me but otherwise it was ok . the kale salad was super spicy for me so my friend finished it . for entrees , i decided to get the pork belly and pork shoulder dish that was the iron chef dish . i got the coconut rice along with the entree . for my friend , she got the duckling and jasmine rice . the sauce for the pork dish was very flavorful with a kick of spice and the pork shoulder pieces were cooked perfectly . as expected , the pork belly was super fatty and probably too fatty for my liking . i absolutely loved the coconut rice . it had a hint of coconut taste but it wasn ' t sugary sweet . it was a very good balance with the pork dish . i didn ' t try the duck dish but my friend loved it and finished it all . i did get to peek at her dish and it had a duck breast cut into pieces and a duck leg -- in other words , it had substantial meat for the order . with our meal , i got the thai iced tea and my friend got a glass of red wine . i think the thai iced tea was a bit too sweet with the condensed milk , but again it definitely provided some relief with the spicy food . we also got two pieces of dove chocolates with our bill . can ' t complain about free stuff ! services was really good with the exception that waiters keep kicking my chair since i was sitting at the seat on the outside and right next to the cashiering desk . i don ' t think i would return for their dinner menu and i personally didn ' t find it amazing . however , i did see pictures of their brunch menu items and some of them looked really good and i would love to try . 
worst service in chinatown for ok food . chinatown service is usually efficient - ( fast , no small talk , etc . i can deal with it ) . but the waitstaff here was downright rude - ( i ' ve been here a few times but this was definitely the last ) . the waitress was absurdly aggresive and antagonistic to my family . in all my years of eating in chinatown - this was hands down the worst service ever ( and that ' s quite a statement , haha ) . what kind of establishment allows their waitstaff to scowl and yell at patrons when they ' re putting in an order ? it was super weird and super rude - apparently we didn ' t order enough food ? we don ' t know- either way , it was uncalled for . all in all , the food is decent chinese fast food - but not worth the stomach churning service . not worth it to ruin your visiting out-of-town family ' s meal with waitstaff who give you attitude it ' s worth it to trek a few extra blocks to congee bowery or congee village ( most of my hk friends agree that this is less touristy - albeit less centrally located - and the food is better quality and less expensive ) from now on . better selection of authentic chinese dishes , efficient ( though still not entirely friendly - but not rude either ) service , and better congee ( great consistency , lower price too ) , solid won ton noodle soup . 
been here a few times and my food is usually pretty good . mariscadas are awesome and the sangria great . the decor is pretty nice but every time i go there it is very very loud . so loud that it is very difficult to hear someone sitting across from you . this is a bit of downside if you are planning on having any conversation at the table . location is great . . it ' s hell ' s kitchen so there ' s restaurants galore if you don ' t like this one
coming in at around N the blt on whole wheat might be the best deal in the city . i always ask for my fries well done because i am that type of guy . 
this is by far the best kabob house i have eaten at . they have the most authentic food and service is amazing . the tandoori chicken and naan are to die for . in addition , the sauces and chutneys are home made . 
i love mezcal . it ' s lively , it ' s friendly and the food is out of this world . this is the real thing , authentic mexican recipes -- which means some folks expecting standard mexican fare might be confused or even disappointed . mama guda ' s chicken stood out in particular . the owners are friendly , sincere and welcoming . my one complaint is that service was spotty when i visited hopefully they ' ll clear that up in time . 
indian kerala style food at its best ! very authentic reminding of eating in kerala itself . the fish moilee with tilapia and kozhi varutharachatu . . was just great ! great place with attentive staff that we will keep going back to . . keep it up kochi ! 
this place is just plain awesome . from the moment i walked in , i knew it was going to be good . having high expectations from these yelp reviews , i drove off the beaten path during a drive from paramus to philadelphia to check this place out . . and i didn ' t regret one moment of it . maybe i should consider myself lucky that i found a parking space open right in front of the place . i had to pay for it , of course . N cents for N minutes seemed like enough time for lunch . as soon as i walked in , i was happily greeted by a fine mannered gentleman who offered my pick of tables and presented me with the menu . most of what they offer is on the healthy side , and all of the ingredients they use are fresh . one of the specials of the day was a grilled chicken sandwich with mango and strawberries . i ordered this , and a cup of the carrot potato soup . the sandwich came with a spinach salad and everything was just deeelicious and i felt like i was having a good , healthy meal . as a drink i ordered lemonade , which was homemade and perfectly balanced . the service was friendly and very fast , despite being a full house , and my experience here was easily N stars . . . perhaps more . . it was well worth detour off the garden state . the red eye cafe receives my highest recommendation to my fellow yelpers . 
the sandwiches are superb and the service is friendly , albeit a bit on the slow side . the san antonio is now one of my fav roast beef sandwiches with a horseradish spread and cheddar . soooo good . the bread is soft and fresh , and the beef tender . the savannah is thanksgiving on bread , basically , and the perfect blend of brie , roast turkey , and cranberry sauce , all on yummy multi-grain bread . i don ' t think that i ' ve been disappointed by any of their offerings . i ' ve also had the new york panini , which is a delectable grilled reuben . okay , seriously , go and get a sandwich . i ' m getting hungry writing this review . . . and i just had dinner and dessert . trust me , this place is a keeper . i ' m giving N stars , for now , until i have tried their breakfast . 
i was charged N for a burned , greasy so-called extra large side order of mac n cheese which was stuffed into a chinese food container . they charged N for a side order of disgusting potatoe salad that made my child naseated . did i mention the N inch steroid induced porkchop that was raw inside ? i will never eat there again . the wait time is crazy , i wasted nearly N . i threw the food away ! they don ' t even have paper menu ' s ! the woman at the register is wicked , evil . 
i figured while i was in the land of yelp yelping for place in nyc i had to mention this one . my esthetician said her sis took her here , and when i looked it up on yelp it had good enough reviews to try it out . it may be tiny as all sh t and the lines are hella long , but the pizza is drool over , orgasmically , good . now being born and raised in los angeles , maybe i don ' t hold pizza to a high standard , but what the hell is wrong with all you yelpers saying this place is N stars ? do you eat pizza ? geez . all ny pizza is good to me , but this place is worth the wait in line during a snow storm . it also is nice that is is right by the rice pudding place . mmmm i want the stuff now ! gooey . crusty . mmmm . . . 
pretzels are awesome . atmosphere is awesome . customer service is great ! ! ! they really do care if you enjoy yourself here ! 
i ' m from nutley and live around a lot of good italian restaurants , but francesca ' s is hands down my favorite . some say the secret to a good italian restaurant is in their sauce . well , not only is francesca ' s sauce super delicious , their ingredients are fresh and made by order . i ' ve ordered the penne vodka with a side of fresh meatballs and chicken cutlet sandwich with broccoli rabe and fresh mozzarella . it ' s heaven sent ! this will be the first establishment i think of when i am in the mood for italian food ! 
this place is terrible . if you enjoy an incredibly rude waitstaff then this is the place for you . if you prefer a pleasant dining experience then stay away . i would never go here again . the waitstaff are too busy socializing amongst themselves to pay any attention to your order . if you ask them a question about why they forgot to bring something to you expect a major attitude . also , everything was incredibly over-salted . the burger was almost inedible . the black label burger at minetta tavern is better by leaps and bounds . 
this place is awesome . . . everything on the menu is great ! this place is addicting . . . the food portions will fill you up . 
brunch was underwhelming . and overpriced . N for coffee ? N for a can of soda ? 
this is the iphone of pizzas , it started the pizza crazy the way the iphone started the single touch screen that we all use everyday . if that isn ' t enough to get you in the door , then please move to the midwest . 
made an impromptu visit here after driving back from locust valley for some by-the-water lunch and drinks with friends . locanda verde was cozy , private and most notably had really comforting food . it was a sunday evening at Npmish so i don ' t think i got the full experience but the food was good . we had this buttery gooey bread appetizer ( i think it was the ricotta dish ) . for my main plate i ordered the beet and goat cheese ravioli which was fantastic . it was a small plate of food but i made up for it with the appetizer . . . and dessert . we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding-perfect for sharing and a phenomenal end to the whole meal . 
after catching a show at the nearby st . james theater , i brought a visiting friend here for her last night in town . we had already had dinner before our show and were there strictly on cheesecake business . i had been introduced to this place by my sister when i visited years ago and fell in love . it was packed when we arrived but amazingly were seated in about N minutes . despite how busy they were our waiter was very attentive ! our water glasses never got lower than half way before he was there to fill it right back up . and do i really need to say anything about their cheesecake ? we got the chocolate swirl and it was scrumptious ! will be returning here more often now that i live in this great city . 
i have eaten at sakagura about six or eight times . it is beneath the basement of Nrd street between Nrd and Nnd avenue , the downsides of the restaurant are the size ( which means that it literally feels like you are sitting in a mob bar ) and also the very traditional japanese menu ( if you are traveling with non- japanese individuals ) . once my companions were very surprised by the menu . i personally love the variety of sake ( the name does mean " sake warehouse " and the restaurant always has winning sake ) and the variety of sushi . as for the other dishes on the menu , some of the meat dishes are excellent as well . be certain to call ahead for a reservation - the seating is limited and the restaurant is always crowded ! 
psst ! it ' s portuguese bbq . this is not the same as southern bbq but with these tips you can eat a great meal . pork ribs are definitely a favorite ! fun for whole family . the black beans over seasoned yellow rice can tame a big appetite as a side and compliments ribs well . even my toddler approves ! four and a half stars easy ! ! ! beef ribs are tasty , but not nearly as perfected as their pork ribs and earn an easy four stars ! rotisserie chicken is good ! plenty of finger lickin ' for a four star rating ! garlic chicken you can pass on . i ' ve had better chicken at well . . . uh . . mcdonalds . tastes like chicken boiled in water , colored orange with some minced garlic in a jar sprinkled on top and slapped in a plastic container . had no taste and was downright disgusting . was extremely disappointed to say the least . ( for those tv lovers , if chef ramsey ate this garlic chicken he would rip this place apart for sure with a bunch of bloody things to say and have bleeped out . so steer clear of the garlic chicken ! ! ! ) zero stars ! so now what can u do ? trash the review from one bad selection and disappointing outcome ? or focus on the good ? well , in all fairness , i think this place deserves a N . . . as long as you never order the garlic chicken . happy eats ! enjoy ! 
my girlfriend and i were looking for a place that served veggie burgers and regular burgers when we caught wind of food being made . turns out it was bonnie ' s a place neither of us had been to before . we sat quickly and were served in a quick and friendly manor . the place has very little bullshit so you get a simple menu with real human food , real beer , decent prices , and a portion that makes sense . we will definitely go back here . anyplace that makes good food with no pretense at all gets N big stars . cash and credit plus to-go would make this place the top destination for food if i lived nearby . 
you walk into this teeny hole-in-the-wall off sansom st around Nst , maybe N seats around the well-stocked sushi case . chefs are friendly in their sushi-chef kind of way . large selection of rolls and nigiri , not a lot else ( so beware of dragging along a non-sushi-eater . . . ) . you are surprised at the prices--very reasonable for a center-city restaurant of any stripe , much less a sushi bar . your order arrives , and---whoa ! that ' s some good sushi ! then--given the price and the quality--you of course stuff yourself beyond all reason , and stagger out feeling a bit sheepish , but definitely satisfied . bear in mind they don ' t serve anything alcoholic , but you can byo . also because it ' s small , plan to get there early ( Npm is not at all too early ) , or there will be a wait . probably not too long though--the chefs are fast , and people tend not to linger . they also have take-out my daughter , who lives nearby , tells me it ' s fast and reliable . bon appetite ( sorry , can ' t say that in japanese . . . ) . 
this place is tiiiiiiiiiiight . nubby high tables jutting from the wall for two-person conversations ? wicked smart . 
sushi house N is a wonderful dining experience . the restaurant is beautiful and the service is flawless . i highly recommend the scallop rosette as an appetizer and the chocolate peanut butter dessert . we were thrilled when the restaurant presented us with an extra special dessert to acknowledge our anniversary . thank you . 
mike p . this is my first and last time i will go to this bistro . the person i was with was there before and waited along time for the food wich was just average , while the fire alarm went on for about N minutes . considering the issue at hand , thought it was worth trying again . they say they serve till N pm , that is serve , not close ! we arrived at N Npm creating a not so happy waiter who rushed us through looking at the very limited menu , kept looking at his watch and kept asking if we were ready to order about every N seconds . also , he would forget to bring us things when we asked for them . i could go on but lets get to the food . the appetizer was cold , eggplant rollatini , had to be sent back . it was more like a flat piece of eggplant with cheese over it . asked for two plates since we were sharing the app . he seemed dumb founded by our request then only brought us one ! i had to go accross the room to find one more . the two dinners were priced N . N more then on zinna ' s web page . wach out for that bait switch ! the ravioli was average , not much flavor , very little sauce cold . had to ask for sauce on the side . no spoon , asked N time never received one . the penne with crumbled sausage , roasted garlic and a vodka sauce was average and hot , but no roasted garlic what so ever ! ( that is a favorit of mine , i know what true roasted garlic is ! ) as a matter of fact , no garlic at all was vissable or to taste . and it was on the dry side , only sauce on the top . it was N pm now so we would not even dare to ask for dessert , though he did offer it , we were already being pushed out the door . with all the cleaning around us going on . we could tell they wanted us to leave . as for the menu itself , very overpriced in every catagory and does not come with a salad . they need to look around the area and see what other places are offering for a better price other wise i would think that they will not make it to the end of the year ! they seem to be on the italian side but they didnt even have speaghette or meatballs or sausage ! but they do have buffalo wings ! ( ha ha ) . my advice , give it a try for yourself then go to others in the area and see how much more food tou can get for about one third lower pricing . i mean chicken parm that does not come with a salad should not cost N . N ! good luck to all who dare ! 
excellent food with very friendly service ! we were very pleasantly surprised by this place ! tried it on a family member ' s recommendation and we had a large family group going . we had made a reservation for late lunch , but then found we were going to arrive early - they said no problem and got us in immediately . we had also heard it was byob , but when we arrived they were able to serve liquor . regardless , they were ok with opening our bottle and serving it to us . the service was very friendly and attentive . they are willing to make whatever changes you like to the menu . most of us had various apps that were all very good , but the real specialty is their homemade pasta . i had the rigatoni with roasted eggplant , tomatoes and mozzarella , but i substituted their fresh tagliatelle - wow , scrumptious and huge portions ! plenty to take home for a second meal . this was the case with everyone ' s entrees they are very generous with their portions . my brother-in-law wanted eggplant parm , and although it was not on the menu they had no problem making it for him . everyone enjoyed their food and would highly recommend this place . all our dishes were good , but i would always recommend the fresh pasta dishes - you can ' t go wrong with fresh pasta ! 
if i could just order a giant tray ( tray , not pie , i ' m from scranton ) of the farmhouse flatbread pizza , i would . buttery with apples , bacon , and cheddar , it ' s to-die-for . really , that ' s the only reason it has N stars . without the pizza , it would be N . meal was still decent , though . arugula salad with goat cheese and candied pecans and vinaigrette was great , cocktails are always made fresh ( cucumber , gin , cracked pepper drink reminded me of summer ) . i can ' t remember what my boyfriend got , i think some type of steak and asparagus dish and it was cooked perfect , just kind of lacked in seasoning . i got an open faced bison burger with a yogurt sauce drizzled over it . it came with roasted potatoes in a tomato sauce and green beans . very homey and stick-to-your-ribs kind of dish , though it didn ' t all seem to go together in taste for me . the bison was awesome and if i could have had just the meat and yogurt sauce with a different type of vegetable and no potatoes on the side , that would have been just fine . even though i couldn ' t move after the baseball-sized bison meatball , i still ordered a delicious mixed fruit crumble for dessert , perfect for the season . overall , i get the whole yuppie " locally grown , organic , free range " hype and the food was all very solid , but i ' m not entirely sure it ' s worth the price . 
best chicken rice in the city , and incredibly cheap . they have a cart open at N am near the moma , and they now have multiple carts ( at the same intersection though ) . beware the red sauce - it ' s super hot ! tip you can ask for no lettuce , and they ' ll give you extra rice and meat . 
there are few restaurants anywhere , in any state or country , that can hit every single note dead on . and this is really something no one should ever ask of a restaurant that it be utterly perfect in each way . and yet , somehow , misery loves co . manages to pull this off . misery is situated in a picturesque small town overlooking a kind of monstrous waterfall , and it is a really quiet , surreal place . misery is spare and retro , with white walls set off by an open black-hooded kitchen . it is like a location in a dream , the way in dreams things aren ' t really specific or gaudy or limited to a certain era . my girlfriend and i shared two items for lunch , a chicken liver mousse special and the vonnegut sandwich . each was amazing . the chicken liver mousse came with a strawberry onion marmalade , yummy little mustard seeds , and mint leaves ( ! ) the combination of the strawberry and the caramelized onion mixing with the fatty chicken liver and bright mint on top of the crusty bread was inspired . what was most inspired of all , though ? the vonnegut sandwich , which was for both my girlfriend and myself absolutely one of finest sandwiches we have had . it had this thin , crispy layer of pork belly sandwiched under a fried egg that let out this amazing gooey yolk . the sandwich then suddenly became a play on the classic fast food cheeseburger with melty american cheese and thousand island dressing-type spread on the buns . it was just a satisfying , and smart , and ironic sandwich . so yeah , we hit a lot of places when we went to the burlington area but this is the first restaurant i wanted to write a review for and the first one i think of now when i think of winooski or of strange waterfalls or soft , white rooms . 
very good chicken but only reason i gave it N star is because me and my wife witnessed the owner yelling at one of his employees in front of us , was really nasty with his poor choice of words , i ' m sorry you just don ' t do that in front of your customers ever . 
the devil ' s alley strikes you at first as a fun spot to go for some drinks and bbq . i decided this last sunday to give it a run for brunch . the menu comes across as spicy and greasy with fun drinks to go with . once we finally got our servers attention we ordered the shrimp hash with andouille sausage and chorizo scramble with grilled tomatoes . i can be a little tough on service sometimes but i would have to say this took the cake . not only was our server rude and unavailable , she seemed wildly irritated with a nice server that filled our long empty coffee . the food came under-seasoned and overcooked , though pleasantly hot and greasy . we finished with full stomachs from the large portions . the mediocre food was the only saving grace for our terrible service . our server only appeared to drop the check . once we had paid she only reappeared to tell us she had given the wrong check which she through down and walked away . we will visit again , but probably just stick to the bar . 
i have been to chez moi over a dozen times , for brunch and dinner . for brunch , their eggs benedict and grits are real gems . as for dinner , i love their mussels and risotto . and , you can ' t go wrong with any of their cocktails . i highly recommend chez moi for brunch or dinner . 
peaches service is mediocre . the last time i went i had a server who was unprofessional and rude . " i thought the customer is always right , right ? " . other than that , the food was delicious . i loved the pulled pork sandwich and their brooklyn wings are outstanding ! when at the bar , it takes a little long to get your drink in addition to no available seats at the bar , but the drinks are addictive and creative . 
came here with my bf after a day out in nyc . he always wanted to come here and im glad he did . our server was great and we ordered the chicken parm with angel hair pasta which was huge and delicious ( we had left overs for two days ) this place definitely requires a party of N plus . the only disappointment were the cannolis they only looked great . but i would definitely go back and try something different next time . 
the pizza from dayton street is very good . fantastic marinara and a buttery thin crust with a bit of char . everything you expect from new haven style pizza . plus- if you choose delivery , it come hand delivered by the hottest subaru driving delivery guy i have ever seen . my only regret is that i didn ' t get his name so i could facebook stalk . 
honestly , i think people come here because its dirt cheap . you can feed N people for under N . it was a snack , but the four of us had a duck pancake , N order of fried dumplings , N orders of steamed dumplings N order of fried buns , N wonton noodle soup for N . they were all mediocre at best but a line started forming after we ordered . thank god we beat the rush . i would ' ve been angry if i had to wait to eat this mediocre food . 
 N . N N ? Nhhk----com 
best empanadas ive had so far in the us outside of my home country , paraguay . definitely a must if you want to try some authentic latin american food . thr brazil and the meat empanadas were my favorites . the only issue is that the place is a bit small . other than that , the food is great . 
disappointing for dinner . my husband had the salmon which was dry . waitress said if he didn ' t like it that way , he could ask for it medium or rare next time . my opinion , for twenty bucks , it should not come out dry . i had the pasta putenesca and it was just bleh . lacking in flavors . for eighteen dollars , i expected a lot more . neither dish came with salad . our meal came to N for two salads and two entrees plus iced tea . way overpriced for what we got . 
this is my korean restaurant go to . love their stone pot rice and their soft tofu soup . so much food that i always have to take leftovers home . 
i decided to check out zento for the first time last night based on it ' s great reviews and i wasn ' t disappointed was an excellent variety of their cuisine . also , towards the end it was nice that the waitress asked if i would like something else prior to the dessert course . in which , i tried a bit more of their sushi with an avocado and eel roll and an order of uni with a quail egg . with the sushi , the quality of meat was amazing , but the sushi roll was lacking . if you ' re looking for an astonishing japanese dinner this would be the place . if you ' re looking for a night of sushi , look else where . i will be back . 
the thirsty koala is a breath of fresh air in the otherwise stale restaurant venue of astoria . amidst all the greek and sushi restaurants is a different and refreshing " down under " restaurant . the food is fresh and of the highest quality and prepared with an eye for perfection . the atmosphere is bright and airy with an inviting appeal . i highly recommend trying this place . 
cedarhurst is a wonderful coffee shop ! for those who miss greenwell , the new owners have left virtually everything unchanged , from the menu selection to the music and the layout of the caf ( the bouncy chairs are still around ! ) . even the employees are the same , and it is great to walk in and see a familiar face . like its predecessor , cedarhurst provides a relaxed , friendly , upbeat atmosphere for its patrons . whether you are looking for a place to study or to meet with a friend , i highly recommend you check it out ! 
this is place should have an overall N or N . N . i just think N is a but too generous . made a reservation for N and still waited N minutes . . . they did make up for it by giving us a pitcher of complimentary sangria , but it came when the check came and we were ready to start the night out . . . so we didn ' t drink much of it anyway . food was ok , not amazing . . . had the octopus , garlic shrimp , and pickled tuna . none were amazing , a lot of butter in all the dishes . i have had better tapas and i probably wouldn ' t return nice we live in the city of thousands of restaurants , but always glad to give new places a try ! 
has the best breakfast in the area . and the soup on a cold day is to die for . the grilled chicken is out of this world . . . . love the prices and old diner feel . the aspirin , is there are alot of bars in the area . . . and office workers with headaches . . . . 
amazing and totally worth it . so many trendy places are more show than substance , but this place delivers . service was quite snotty and self-assured you would think every single one of the wait staff was the owner and head chef based on how they carry themselves . it ' s also quite crowded if you sit up at the bar . get anything and everything off the menu . you won ' t be disappointed . i haven ' t stopped craving the bass with roasted marrow and barley . it was one of the best things i ' ve had in a long long time . dessert was pretty good but i ' d recommend going next door to milk bar . 
taste
we have been here twice and tried most of the items on the menu . the culinary adventure began with the friendly and cozy ambiance . our dishes came out at the same time so we could share our plates . beef rendang was cooked to the perfect velvety texture , meat was coated with perfect amount of sauce , subtle yet complex flavors continued to develop with each bite . definitely recommend this dish . our other favorites were the fish curry , egg plant ( from the small plates ) , chicken wings , papaya salad ( has a hint of coconut flavor to it ) , chicken wings ( not what you would expect so make sure you try these ) . the nasi goreng ( fried rice ) was very tasty and came with satifying portion . each bite consisted intense but not overpowering shrimp flavor . this dish came with crunchy shrimp crackers and fresh cucumber to balance all the flavors . we wish we had room for dessert , next time . we liked the food here a lot . perfect little place to catch up in the middle of the week with friends ( what we did ) , or just sit at the bar area with the book you always wanted to read but never got to ( what i will do next time ) . p . s . great coffee ! 
the food was ok , it wasn ' t anything spectacular . the only standout was the addition of fried plantain to my chicken quesadilla . the passionfruit margarita was pretty good , but it was just passionfruit puree added to a margarita , so nothing special there . i did go with a big crowd and we were sort of forced out because of a policy they have regarding reservations , based on that that left many of us with a bad taste . our server , however , was quite courteous and i have a feeling that with a smaller group it might have been a better experience . all in all , not bad , but not great . 
this place is consistently fantastic . i dined here for the first time last year and was almost afraid to come back because the experience was so perfect . i finally visited again last month and it was even better ! the service is incredible , the drinks are amazing , and the food is absolutely delicious . one of my favorite restaurants in nyc for sure-- can ' t wait to try every single thing on the menu ! 
this place is overpriced , the staff is rude , the food was awful , it was either too bland or too salty and did not taste very fresh . my husband and i both became ill after eating here . it ruined our anniversary since both of us were too sick afterwards . i would never go back to this place again and neither should anyone else . 
mediocre pizza , terrible service with nasty people . 
i love the options this place has . . . you can get a mix of veggies w tofu . . . somewhat hard to come by if you don ' t go to an asian restaurant . the food was pretty good . nothing special . i did like how they made the tofu though
i am gluten free and discovered this place through a gluten free network , but i have brought innumerable non-gluten free friends here and they have all loved it . many now regularly go for lunch or dinner without a gf companion . as for me , this is one of my favorite restaurants of all time . it ' s cute and small with great music and a fun waitstaff and the food is simply incredible . definitely italian comfort food at its best . 
nice place , but . . . slow , food took an hour plus for N people . the plates were a good size and nicely put together . the pasta special had one small piece of mushroom and no tomatoes . the waitress was nice and the beer was cold . this is not a place to go if you are in a hurry . 
service was a little slow , as we were seated for about N minutes after receiving our menus before being able to place our order . in fact , we chose this restaurant because of a promotional N . N N course meal , and this option was not offered to us until we asked for that particular menu , after N minutes had passed . both the host and our server seemed less than thrilled to be waiting on us , and as another employee was filling our water glasses , our server yelled across the dining room at him and he went scurrying away mid-sentence . the food was great , although my date ' s meal was a pasta dish with pesto that didn ' t appear to include pesto , but it was still delicious ! 
went there a year ago after hearing all the hype about it . had to wait half an hour to be seated and oh the food was totally not worth the wait . definitely had better ramen elsewhere and none of the other dishes were memorable either . the worst part is that it ' s super crowded and noisy , and you have to sit next to strangers ! 
this place is sub-par at best . this was my second time here , having had dinner here over the summer and had a much better experience then . the food was good , nothing super exciting but better than expected . the sweet fries were definitely a huge hit . however , everything else was below expectations . the place looks nice at first glance , however our seat cushions were falling off and there was an obvious mouse trap right by our table ! the service was awful and definitely not what we ' d received on our first visit . our waiter was , quite obviously , high and maybe drunk . he disappeared for quite a bit , and came back smelling like weed - no joke . he was very unattentive and even a little weird at times . definitely not professional . unless you enjoy intoxicated service , and falling apart and infested restaurants , i ' d stay away . 
some people see this hole in the wall as a simple , cheap eatery that serves up cheap roasted meats over rice . i , on the other hand , see a life time of dedication and skill . the store front is pretty hard to miss . if it wasn ' t for the constant line that can stretch out the door and down the block , i would not have found it myself . don ' t let that line discourage you your patience will be rewarded . from dawn until dusk . this team of N serves up some of the best roast pork and duck on this side of chrystie street . just be patient this couple takes their job - and - their domain seriously . " she " works the morning noodles , " he " works everything meaty from taking your order , to chopping your meat , to packing , the taking your payment . the most bang for your buck is the two roasted meats over rice ( usually roast pork and duck for me ) for N . i also go for the roasted meats by the pound ( extra ginger garlic sauce please ! ) when i ' m looking to stock up . but of course , there are some opportunities here . one thing i ' m not super excited about is the roast pig . it ' s only made in small batches and is rarely as crisp as i ' d like it to be . and then there ' s the level of cleanliness that always makes me a little nervous . with only two in the front of the house , it is purely impossible for any cleaning to happen during the day . fortunately i never got sick . come with some patience . just don ' t come hungry . . . or you ' ll just end up cranky from the wait . 
don ' t order fish cake otherwise you want something in unreasonable price . N small pieces which cut in half for N . N . what ' s an expensive appetizer . i ' m really disappointed ! ! ! ! overall other dishes seem cheaper when comparing to fish cake , but the taste are good . 
this place is intimate ( or tiny depending on your point of view ) and i liked the atmosphere immediately . i have been so friggin ' busy with work lately that i haven ' t been able to review very much , so this meal was from back in august . . . sorry for the delay . i can ' t remember the appetizer , but remember it being a lot of ingredients that i wouldn ' t have thought about putting together and that it was good . i then had hanger steak for dinner and it very good for that cut of steak . much more tender than i would expect from a hanger . this place also has a very unique clientele and the people watching that my gf and i enjoyed that night definitely made the experience more enjoyable . there was this kid sitting next to our table commenting on every sip of his wine and his gf who knows what was writing down every word . i had a hard time not laughing out loud ( and the wine was like a N bottle of wine . . . if you are going to act that ridiculously pretentious please do so with good wine ) . there were others that i could write about , but i ' ll keep this review about the food . overall it was very good and i would go back for sure . my only complaint is that it was uncomfortably hot in there . . . like i was sweating . they must not have had a . c . or something . anyways , still very strong little spot . . . i ' m a fan . 
close this place down ! omg ! N for three yes three scallops ! had to order a drink ( some apple something with bourbon ) twice because the first one was full of ice . seriously overpriced worst N i ever spent . went home and had two ramen noodles hmm not hungry anymore ! 
if you are reading this . . . save yourself , it ' s too late for me , but save yourself . chiang kai-shek and chairman mao could agree on this . . . hideous . i can only assume that it has changed hands since the glowing reviews , or that the writers were suffering from msg induced hallucinations . ok , in case i expire before tomorrow , here are the details . cold sesame noodles . . . at least they were in fact cold . other than that , the closest this " sauce " came to sesame was if the cook said " open sesame " as he opened the lid on the jar and spooned this stuff on . general tso ' s chicken would make mcnuggets ashamed to be chicken . some kind of ground up ersatz fat and chicken mulch that were liberally coated in some day glo red sauce , probably left over from a jar of marachino cherries , with a pepper thrown in for " heat " . . . so flavorless that i can ' t even comment on the taste , only the texture which i will undoubtedly relive in countless nightmares . and as reported previously , the " brown " rice isn ' t . unless tumeric or soviet toxic waste counts . fail . . . utter abysmal fail on all counts . fail even by food cart standards . . . fail that makes the edsel look like a triumph . i walked the fine line between not wanting to go to bed hungry and not wanting to offer my thanks to the porcelain altar but the rest has gone in the dumpster . . . with a skull and crossbones on it lest a desperate homeless person be poisoned . ugh . . . need to wash my mouth out . . . honestly . 
this place is so great ! i love their " manakeesh " they have different varieties , and so far they ' re all great ! i have had the one with cheese and spinach with some zaatar , and must say it has been my favorite so far . the kafta one is the most popular among my parents ( and probably anyone who grew up in the middle east ) - very much reminds me of all of our visits to israel growing up , along with an amazingly friendly and giving staff ! they ' re also going to be opening a juice bar soon - this was the most exciting news i got yesterday , especially being that with my new work out schedule and dietary intakes , this will be amazing and completely worth the trip to west philly after some intense work outs ! 
this pizza is so freaking good . there ' s always a long line so i never bothered and the name , artichoke made me think , healthy , which doesn ' t interest me when buying a slice of pizza . . so i was with a friend , he ' s a regular , he asked if i went there , he explained the difference with this pizza , ( it ' s not traditional pizza folks ) how it ' s made and we went . he goes , i ' m a get a crab pizza , i wrinkled my nose and said , see fish and crustaceans don ' t belong on a pizza . . . he got me a plain ole slice , which was delicious , but i was staring at his it had chunks of crab and a white cheese sauce ( chowder ? ) and i took a bite , oh yum ! i ate his pizza then sent him back N more ! what i noticed was it was saucy but the pizza dough was not soggy it was crispy , how ' d they manage that ? the crab was fresh and so flavorful i defitnitley recommend
only good place around to grab a really good panini
ate at the bar early on a wednesday night . nice vibe and was greeted warmly right away by the bartender . wine selection was okay at best , but the food i had was fantastic . had the gnocchi followed by the rabbit . my only two complaints would be the bread ( which is basically a step above white wonder bread ) and the bones in the rabbit tips . tough to get around , but made it difficult to eat . will definitely be back to try other items . 
on the way home after theater and felt compelled to write an honest review about at nine a thai restaurant in the theater district . trendy without and reason . lousy service . had dinner with my wife and they never brought out both meals at the same time . when they brought the appetizers immediately afterwards came the soup to get cold . they offer a gluten free selection , she ordered salmon which didn ' t have anything to do with thai . i had chicken pad thai which i couldn ' t finish and i never leave anything on my plate which will tell you how bad it was . service bad , food bad , pretty , small , and loud . not a place that you want to waste your hard earned money on . too many places in the immediate vicinity that you ' ll enjoy so much better . 
was in ny a few weeks ago and decided to go on yelp to see where i could find some good breakfast . . . . and sure enough this place popped up . first off i liked that it was a hole in the wall type of place and with great reviews , i had to try it and i ' m happy i did . yes food was super greasy , but it was so good . i had eggs , bacon , and french fries yes french fries for breakfast wasn ' t so happy about that , but they ran out of the homemade potatoes oh well . the service was great , they even knew their customers by name . . . . and there was plenty of customers coming by . if your ever in ny definitely check this place out . 
so we wanted to do something different last night , and i suggested moto . i used to live right on broadway and keap and would walk by there every day , and for the longest time i had no idea that any kind of business was actually in that strangely shaped building on the corner . but , i eventually caught on , partly from the smells that drift onto the street from the open kitchen door during dinner time , and it ' s been a favorite of mine ever since . i ' ve recently moved , and my boyfriend suggested we go out to dinner , and being that i was just telling my friend about this place - i suggested moto . i am so glad we did ! ! i called at about N , to see about a reservation , or how long the wait was . they don ' t take reservations , but the sweet girl that answered the phone let me know that they were steady , and my best bet is just to come and put our names in ! last seating is at N N . we got there at about N , and were told that the wait was N min . we were seated within N , and immediately got a bottle of water and some glasses . we went over the menu , and as soon as we put them down , the waitress was there to take our order , despite it being so busy . we got a gruyere cheese fondu with crostini and an arugula salad to split as a starter , and both were delicious ! ! the items came out fast , and the beer we ordered came right away . my boyfriend had the mac cheese ( great onions on top , a fantastic , cinnamon-y homemade apple sauce on the side , and a great texture throughout ) he was happy with his dinner , and cleaned his plate . i went for the more adventurous choice , and told the waitress that if the mussels were fresh from today , that i ' d have those , and if not - i ' d have the chicken . she said they were fresh , and i got the mussels . an over flowing bowl of mussels with an herb broth on the bottom , and an extra bowl for the shells . i ate a good portion of them , but i didn ' t love them . that is the only reason that i am giving this place N stars . we also got an antique dessert wine from australia that was a little sweet for me , but my boyfriend loved it ! i got the homemade fudge for dessert , and it was rich , creamy , perfectly sweet , and had a great balance of chocolate and walnuts . this place is a super romantic place to go for dates , and the band in the front corner that was playing was fantastic ! ! i would definitely recommend this place to anyone , going on a date , and i will absolutely be back ! probably not the best idea for large groups . great atmosphere , friendly staff , good music , good food . a hidden gem - in the most unexpected place ! 
my favorite place in new haven ! ! ! love the vegetarian arepas , either the grilled , cheesy , piled high colombian style or the baked , stuffed with fresh avocado and sweet plantains venezuelan style . also . the guacamole . the wait staff is so kind and friendly ) also i love to have large parties here . you can make a reservation and get a whole wing to yourself . . with great music to boot . they don ' t serve alcohol but i find this to be a plus -- you can bring your own wine beer and have your favorites without paying restaurant prices on the drinks . 
heard about this place from a friend . boy was i glad that i did . was easily able to reserve a table for N Npm on a thursday . just in time for the flamenco dancers . loved the decor . had the champaign sangria was delicious . you ' ll wanna get the full pitcher . we had ordered N dishes to share . steak was delicious and also had goat cheese . any plate that passed looked great ! waite staff friendly and always kept my glass full . i will return
first off , be prepared to wait for a really long time for sunday brunch . we had to wait N . N hours and were able to fit in mass at a nearby church . that ' s how long the wait was . so come in knowing that there will be a wait . the food was amazing , the service was unfortunately not . we ordered a mimosa as soon as we sat down , watched it mixed , and watched it sit there on the opposite counter -- never making it to our counter ( as i guess another waiter took it mistakingly to another table ) . after N minutes , we asked the bartender again for it who apologetically made us one . we would have been understanding that day if we hadn ' t come in from such a long wait . other than that , the food was really good . i ordered the southwest hash with chorizo , bacon and biscuits while the girlfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes with the sugar-cured bacon . we were kind of disappointed with the little amount of blueberry mix given but i guess we attributed that to the end of the brunch shift , possibly ? but it was delicious though . the hash was savory and poppin ' with flavors and they didn ' t hold back on the chorizo ! the pancakes were soft and buttery . it was a nice treat at the end of a long N . N hour journey for a bomb ass brunch . 
i have been here many times and the food is great . the new chef has reinvented the menu while still keeping some old favorites ( the amazing chicken sandwich ) . the appetizers and salads add something extra to this pub and transform it from a guy hang out to someplace i can bring my girlfriend to . overall everything at this place is good and i find myself getting something different every time and am never disappointed . the drinks are also fun and exciting , i especially like the beer sampler as it gives me a chance to try a variety without getting too drunk . 
this is a way over-due review . i visited cielo in january N while waiting in the stand-by ticket line for ' book of mormon ' . the bar restaurant is directly adjacent to the theater . the bartenders know the meaning of the word service prompt , efficient and personable . melanie and bianca , even charged my phone for me . during intermission , the lines at the theater were so long , i hopped back over to cielo where i enjoyed a mid-theater cocktail . not quite finished with it , they held it for me til after the show . felt like i was in my own corner of ' cheers ' where everyone knows your name . thanks ladies and staff of cielo ! next time i hope to have time to sample the menu . 
brussels sprouts ? i ' ll pass brussels sprouts with bacon ? yes please ! i would ' ve never thought about this combination but let me tell you something bacon makes brussels sprouts tastes damn good . that was just a side though . . . i enjoyed my lunch so much ! i had the day boat scallops and they were cooked perfectly . cooking seafood and more importantly she ' ll fish can go horribly wrong . a true testimony to any establishment that offers an array of food is to try their seafood . if that ' s done well you can be certain the rest of the menu will follow suit . i ' ll definitely back to try the dinner menu soon ! 
philly cage match . N go it , N comes out . in this bout , the venerable philly cheesesteak represented by jim ' s steaks vs the roast pork sandwich from tommy dinic ' s in the market . both these places were easy to spot as both had incredible lines . jim ' s took me about N minutes to order . dinic ' s about N . this was on an early friday afternoon . this is my first try of the traditional philly cheesesteak . despite what i have heard , you can get your sub anyway you want , without any fuss from the staff . i watched and learned . the " typical " way was wiz and with . that ' s cheese wiz with onion . so there i had the traditional cheese steak . sadly , i think the roll was my favorite part of the sandwich . the meat could have really benefited from some salt and pepper . the meat onion cheese proportions were about perfect . it was good , very good . better than just about anything you can get around here . but i have had better . the restaurant was clean and staff friendly and entertaining . cheese wiz . . . hhmm . . . good drunk food to be sure but provolone would have been better . up next was the pork sandwich from dinic ' s . the food stall is located in the reading terminal . what an awesome market . why can ' t we have a market like this around here ? anyway , the pork sandwich from dinic ' s is about as legendary as any sandwich , and for good reason . i got mine with provolone and broccoli rabe . i think this is the first time i had ever had broccoli rabe . the meat was sliced thin and piled high . it was very moist and perfectly seasoned . in fact the seasoning combined with the juice from the meat and the bread ( another great roll ) , had a flavor profile that immediately reminded me of my mother ' s bread stuffing in turkeys . that was it . a tie in to a terrific memory of my mother ' s cooking . the steak and cheese didn ' t have a chance . this sandwich was absolutely incredible . the broccoli rabe was full of flavor . a little nutty , a little bitter , and crunchy . it was a great match for the pork . add some really good provolone cheese ( no cheese type product from a can ) and you have an absolute winner . the line was long and the fine folks , both patrons and staff , will never be accused of being very friendly , but i would do it all again in heartbeat . 
i ' ve ordered the krab rangoon , which is one of their appetizers . best thing that i ever tasted in my life . their combination platter has a lot of taste . i kinda want to order more of their selections but i got too full . the staff are friendly too . if you ' re in the area , i recommend to check this place out . 
this is one of the best places to eat in astoria . i ' ve never had a bad experience here and i go at least once every other month . if you can catch it , get the tomato soup . i recommend il bambino to all my friends . 
i have been coming to jose tejas for years , but it i am sorry to say - after tonight ' s treatment , i will never step foot in there again . i am not only going to bombard the social media with this outrageous treatment , but i will be registering a complaint with the better business bureau . we were at the bar as always having cocktails , while we waited the abnormal amount of time for a table , when we got buzzed to be seated . my husband went to claim our seats , while i was in the ladies room and our friends were paying the bar tab . my husband was not only scolded for the whole party not being present , but was threatened with the lose of our table . ( this happened a couple weeks back , where we actually lost our table for not all being present while paying a bar tab ) . we all made our way to the table and asked for a manager . very nice young man , who was patient and a good listener , trying to explain to us the corporate policy . we finally move on from this episode , but not for long . . . . . my friend order a meal to go for her son as she has done numerous times before , but the waiter told her no he she couldn ' t have take out orders . to our amazement asked when this happened . . . . with some back and forth we thought he surrendered to place the order , but lo and behold another manager walks over . ( not as nice as the first one ) . this manager was indignant , rude and just talked over my friend as if he really didn ' t care as to her complaint . let ' s just say it got a bit heated , we paid our check and was preparing to leave . my friend asked for the managers business card as well as corporate . the waiter provided us with his first name only as he didn ' t know his last name . after a brief conversation , the waiter went back and told the manager she called him an ass . next thing we knew - the manager is following her out of the restaurant - coming at her with insults . i ' ve never seen a manager chase any customer . how can a corporation as popular as jose tejas employ such trash . unprofessionally , rude and disrespectful people . even some of the hostesses believe they are the almighty with their nasty attitudes . this restaurant has gone down hill . they rank up there with comcast , verizon , etc . no one cares about the loyalty of their current customers , they ' re out there looking for the next new customer . they want you back when your gone . . . . they need to go back in time where customer loyalty and satisfaction was the most important thing to a business . being treated like you are a nobody and your opinion means nothing , isn ' t a place i want or will frequent ever again . 
the food here is exceptional . i haven ' t had pasta this good in ages . we had stracci wide ribbon pasta , braised porcini mushrooms and cappelletti truffled mascarpone ravioli , melted butter , prosciutto . the cappelletti were delicious , but the showstopper is the stracci . the feel of osteeria morini is casual and rustic , and the food has simple elements prepared perfectly . we also had a delicious salad and wonderful desserts . it is a popular spot and crowded so it can be a bit noisy . the only downsize was the service is not impressive and the hosts were not friendly . without reservation , the wait can be an hour . was this review . . . ? 
have to go back to try more broccoli rabe , any hero they make is good . try the mortatella with fresh mozzarella roasted peppers
so , i was brought here by a friend when we needed a place to sit , talk and eat some good food and i ' ve been back every two weeks . the grilled cheese is bomb ( you definitely should add bacon ) , tater tots to die for and you must get tomato soup to dunk everything in . the atmosphere is very chill . they usually have sports on and change it to the game of your choice if you ask so i was able to watch the knicks lose again . the staff is extremely friendly and fun to talk to . i like how they change the name of those tip jar . basically if you are looking to eat good food , chill environment and a couple of laughs , you should check this place out . 
this place is one of my favorite restaurants in philly when i ' m short on time and in need of some yummy comfort food . i went there for lunch today and had chicken saut ed with lemongrass over vermicelli and it tasted great . the portions are quite large so with the leftovers i now have lunch for tomorrow as well ! my friend ordered the broken rice with shrimp but was a little disappointed that the shrimp weren ' t deveined . overall we were both quite happy with our meals . for the price and convenience ( there ' s a parking lot ! ) the food here is great ! 
clean , friendly staff me and a friend enjoyed our first visit ! food was tasty ! bbq sauce was good too ! i would return ! 
best pizza in the city ! 
sat at the bar on a busy sat night with my hot girlfriend-date k . i love dating my gf ' s . they make it so much harder to go on actual dates with boys though . oh , the tragedy . hostess was nice enough to tip me off to who would be leaving the bar soon so i stood behind this couple for literally N mins et voila ! we were seated at the bar . bartender was amazing . hooked us up with some white wine and port , gratis . gave us good oysters rec ' s too . tossed a lil frangelico into our chocolate bread pudding and then offered a grassy minty digestif after our meal . we then stumbled our way to zebulon , bumping into one another giggling all the way . when was the last time you had a date that good ? ) 
i just wanted to thank all the staff for the most wonderful mothers day brunch . it was last minute and there was like N of us , but they made it happen they made it a wonderful experience . my favorite dish eggs benedict was awesome , the holandaise sauce was perfect just the way i like it . in fact everyone at brunch loved their food . 
the food may be cheap and filling , but it ' s far from good and the service is terrible . spend your hard earned money elsewhere at an establishment that at least tries . my table ordered the roast duck soup which had about N hacked up pieces of duck all laced with numerous bones . the only flavor to the duck was star anise and no plate was supplied to allow you to pick at the duck . it ' s one thing to serve meat on the bone , it ' s another to just chop up a bird carelessly so that tiny sharp bones remain and you ' re only armed with a plastic soup spoon . the broth was flavorless salt water . shrimp pancakes were mostly greasy batter with one or two cocktail shrimps per piece . the stir-fried noodles with vegetables were akin to what you ' d get in an inept cafeteria . service was cold and uncaring . there are many other restaurants in new haven who are trying hard to make you good food and provide you with good service . why eat here instead ? 
overpriced sandwich . oyster po boy had N oysters in it , on a large hoagie . disappointed to say the least . 
i have been going to billy murphy ' s for over N years . everyone is welcome . people come from all over to this place and keep coming back . it is friendly and the food is great ( cheese steaks are top notch ) . i used to go there with my parents as a regular stop and every time i meet my friends from high school or my brothers we go to billy ' s . billy ' s son michael is now active in the business and he is doing well in updating and brightening up the place . also good for kids for lunch or an early dinner . my children have good there since they were little and my oldest recently turned N and guess where i am taking her for her first beer with me ? try this place , it will become one of your standards . 
delicious beef noodles and bbq pork . very inexpensive too . 
this menu was so packed full of good looking things that i was overwhelmed deciding . when i finally chose i fell in love with my food at first sight , beautiful presentation . the taste of the food was amazing . i looked at the food , turned to my friend , and said " you can tell whoever made this really loved his job " i wish i could be in philly long enough to eat here several times , maybe next time . 
during a weekday , this is probably the busiest pizza joint west of broad . they have tons of daily pizzas , and offer the " N slices of anything a drink N . N " special that reels ' em all in . however , after about N pm , this place is a ghost town . the pizza is good , but the crust is very floury , and the cheese gets a tad bit greasy . it ' s better made than nearby towers , but there are spots like lazaro ' s that really make dolce futile in your regular pizza consumption . one thing i will say is . . . on tuesday nights , this is where all the open mic comedy club comics practice their routines in the seats . if eavesdropping pity ever becomes a commodity , this is where you ' ll want to be to cash up . 
increidble atmosphere , great people , amazing service ! tons of fun . go go go ! ! steve is the sweetest . food is absolutely delicious . 
a friend of mine picked this place , since i didn ' t want to be venturing around downtown philadelphia late at night on my own . it ' s pretty much right near the rodeway inn on walnut street , so i was like , cool ok . el vez is a bar mexican restaurant that was alive on a nonchalant thursday evening . i was there with a friend of mine after Npm and we had to wait for a table . we finally sat down at a booth at N Npm . i looked at the prices and it was a bit rich for my blood , but i had to eat something . el vez is located on Nth street and samson street in downtown philadelphia . not someplace i would normally be at , but i was with a friend , which made it a pretty good experience . good company and ok food made it a good night . i ordered a strawberry margarita to kick things off , then i ordered the beef tacos , which really turned out to be small beef things on won ton skins . you got to be kidding me , which was my initial reaction . of course , there was four of them , but still , it was tiny . wow . even my friend and i were shocked . and that cost like N or something . wow indeed . still it was tasty , so that part didn ' t bother me too much . i was done in like N minutes and no mess either . it was like an appetizer that somehow made it to the entree part of the menu . el vez seemed to be a large place , with plenty of tables and seats at the bar , but when we were there , some tables were empty , but we couldn ' t be seated right away . that sucks , but whatever . the ambiance felt different , since it somehow felt more nightclub than just a bar and restaurant . still , it was a good experience overall . they , of course , take credit cards , so that ' s always a plus in my book . but she paid this time though , since she lived in philadelphia and i was a visitor . thought that was cool . i was to go to cap giro anyway for some awesome gelato and they didn ' t disappoint either . my friend had some sort of wrap or burrito , which ended up being pretty tasty , as she recalled . recommended if you like a pleasurable experience , mexican food , and a flavorful explosion at your fingertips . support local ! c
wine was not great ( retsina ) octopus and white bean soup were very good . chicken was not . great service , nice atmosphere . watched u . s open at bar . fun place , not great food . 
excellent experience . very good customer service they gave me a bowl of fruit to break my ramazan fast . the bihari gohst and naan were solid . i recommend this place ! 
i would give N . N but don ' t know how to . N . N points taken for tough parking and less than fantastic drinks . am i being too tough ? probably . had the tasting menu at zahav on friday N N . a lot of what i ' m gonna say will be a repeat of all the other great reviews zahav has received . one thing i want to add is that parking was a bit tough . we parked in a lot next to the ritz theater on Nnd . N . u will have to walk by the sheraton , cross the street and go up the steps to zahav which is on the ground floor of society hill towers . definitely make a reservation . since we were searching for parking we ended up being N minutes late and i received a call on my cell to c if we were still going ! not a fan of the drinks . i had the desert rose which was ok and my husband had the goldman which tasted like pure bourbon or maybe an old fashioned . the service was excellent not just because of the number of people waiting on us but also the knowledge of the waitstaff . our server could guide us through the menu without difficulty and knew the details of every dish . whether the haloumi was seared using olive oil or canola oil for example . the manager was a very visible presence . a repeat of what everyone has said about the food in summary laffa hot out of the oven , hummus out of this world creamy . salads all fantastic . many different tastes . duck hearts with pear and onion rings amazing ! fried haloumi with date and walnut fantastic . the one thing iwould say that is different is that i wasn ' t a big fan of the fried cauliflower . hanger steak and meatballs fabulous . pistachio cake is a light not too sweet version of a persian baklava . loved it . french press coffee . a dessert made with shredded phyllo dough and labeneh . the labeneh had a very distinct taste . a little tangy . delish ! didn ' t see any kids . i would take my kids there because they have a relatively sophisticated palate . if yours are into chicken fingers and mac and cheese i wouldn ' t take them . it ' s loud and tables are very close to one another . it ' s actually a very small space . 
i am a huge fan of this place . they have anything and everything except a cheeseburger . but for those that come to claire ' s they aren ' t looking for the fatty boom batty foods . anyone from vegan to vegetarian and beyond will find anything their heart desires here ) great side dishes , smoothies , dessert treats , and all da breakfast ! 
perfectly cooked thin crust that maintains its crunch and doesn ' t get soggy with the weight of its own sauce and grease . we ordered the buffalo mozzarella and basil pizza . although we were pretty happy with everything , our pizza looked kinda sad with only two lonely leaves of basil . but that ' s a minor complaint . excellent pizza and fast and friendly service . 
this place is always packed ! we have lived in east rutherford for almost N years and this is the first time we made it to this amazing gem of a place ! everything down to the orange juice and toast was delicious ! my husband got banana pancakes with eggs over easy and bacon and i got the don quixote omelet ( eggs whites , goat cheese , tomatoes and vegan sausage ) with well done home fries . first thing was the home fries . . nice and crispy , just the way i asked for them . then my husband ordered fresh squeezed oj . . tasted like he was literally drinking out of an orange . we licked our plates clean . even the toast was perfectly toasted ! ! if i could give this place more stars i would ! and the menu is very extensive , vegetarian and vegan friendly ! we will be back for lunch dinner ! 
it ' s pretty disappointing to see all these french restaurants copying pastis when pastis isn ' t even close to a genuine french restaurant ( owned by an english guy and basically typical american food with slight french influence ) . the brunch menu is almost identical to pastis and the food is almost exactly the same it ' s even served on the same looking plate . the only difference i could see is they use better bread for the croque madame and the fries aren ' t as good . this completely defeats one of the main points of small local business . . . we don ' t like homogeneity ! ! ! do something new don ' t copy pastis ' crappy food ! ! that being said the decor is very pleasant , with the wood stove , bookshelves , piano etc . but i dont go out to brunch look at a nicely decorated restaurant ! ! 
i went here last night after the gym to get dinner . it was past Npm but to my surprise there were still a few people eating inside . i got a small spicy sandwich to go and i even got a free falafel ball to eat in the store since they were closing within the hour . i found the small sandwich to be a big enough portion for me for a meal and it was only N . loved my sandwich and will definitely be coming back here again ! 
i work close to grimaldi ' s and i always see a line around the block which made me want to try it more . it seems like every person i bring it up to has the history of this place ready to rattle off at any given time . it was a cold and rainy night . which is how all tv crime dramas start , probably why there was no line on a dark street under a bridge that day lol . walked right in a grabbed a table upstairs . it was a bit different than i thought . before i actually went in i kept getting the vibe that it was fancier than your typical pizza place , then i was brought a bottle soda and a plastic cup of ice and all of that went out the window . i immediately took my napkin out of my lap and put my elbows on the table . there is seating on multiple levels which really impressed me that they were able to fill them all up and still maintain a line around the block . someone in the back is rolling out more dough than a rapper at a strip club . my pizza ( always ) large pepperoni and jalapeno . the large was huge , and topped with great cheese . i ' ve been kind of use to slices with hard cheese that doesn ' t move and sometimes comes off the whole slice in one piece like a down comforter . it ' s not bad , but not the stretchy stringy cheese like you see in the pizza commercials . i got that at grimaldi ' s . the pepperoni were the smaller cut that curls and gets a bit crispier which i actually liked . also there wasn ' t an overwhelming amount of sauce . my only complaint is the toppings weren ' t evenly distributed amongst the slices - which i will give a pass to since they ' re making so many pies at once . if you aren ' t a pizza snob , and you don ' t have to stand in a line long enough to think you ' re about to get the new apple gadget this place isn ' t a bad start or finish to walking around dumbo
the line situation is very weird . if nobody ' s at the counter , just walk up there and order . chances are the twenty other people queued up are waiting for their meals to be made . i had the N ( spicy mashed potatoes ) and the N ( chicken tikka ) . the N was pretty good for about N N of it , and then i got tired of it . it was definitely filling though , but it was hard to discern where the spiciness was coming from . the chicken tikka wasn ' t bad , though i wish it had more sauce . the chicken wasn ' t dry by any means , though . i know this is a very random thing to comment on , but they also have insulated brown bags , so if you ' re ordering for take out ( which most people are ) , your meal will still be warm when you get back to your office or train or whatever . nice touch . will definitely return . 
i have been to several rodizio places , in different countries no less . this is top of the pile . food i suggest you and your whole group go for the rodizio - the endless barbecue . it ' s fun , delicious , and allows for easy conversation . if you decide against the extravaganza of meat their other dishes are excellent as well . the " salad bar " is included and has some nice items . it ' s all starchy stuff that ' s supposed to get you full before you eat the meats , but some of it is very good and worth some " room " - beans , cheese balls ( a brasilian specialty ) , rice , plaintains . in all my experiences there i cannot recall a single time that was disappointed with the meat . it ' s well seasoned and cooked properly . very rarely do you get a tough cut or one that is over cooked . there is a great variety as well ( try a chicken heart , they are delicious ) . when you finish your meal ask for some pineapple . it ' s served hot w a sprinkle of cinnamon - better than any dessert . drinks guarana ! delicious brazilian soda . their sangria is also pretty good , and a pitcher is reasonably priced for sharing . we got almost N glasses out of it . service weekends it can be very busy . if you can ' t stand waiting and want the undivided attention of the servers who are working together to serve every table , then come on a weekday or at lunch . it ' s slightly cheaper and much less crowded , so the service is more personal . desserts they have a cart of desserts that goes around . nothing very special here , and if you still have room left over from the rodizio , you ' re doing it wrong ! 
i finally decided to come here because the N-N hour wait ( as told on the phone ) for ippudo was just too much . after calling totto , i was told our party of N would be approx N minutes , so we head on over and put our name down . the N minute wait ended up being a little over an hour . we were so hungry that no one spoke a word to each other when we got our food , but let me rewind a bit . so we got seated at the counter which ended up being pretty cool because you can see all the magic happen . the place holds about N at the counter and maybe N-N at the tables . . . yes it ' s tiny and they can ' t accomodate more than a party of N , you ' ll be split up for sure . also , cash only . okay , so people weren ' t kidding about them having you order in N seconds or whatever . it was literally more like N seconds , i was overwhelmed . got the spicy ramen with extra corn and bamboo topping . like i said , my friends and i barely spoke a word to each other . . . . either because we sat at the counter or because we were so hungry or because it was tasty . my husband said it was okay but i came out a fan and thought it was really yummy . their char siu pork was probably the best i ' ve ever had ( with the perfect amount of charred fat mmmmmmmm ) . i don ' t think there are many good ramen places in new york , but this will definitely do . . . . although i do need to try ippudo still . 
setting , lovely . food , excellent . why two stars ? service sucks ! ok , ok , i know . i ' m picky about carbonated water . lots of it . but it isn ' t really about the water . it ' s about how an establishment handles a customer when they screw up . fizzy on the menu . bring me a bottle , please . five minutes another server comes to table . ' no water , ' says this server , who i learn is the enforcer . ok , i ' ll just pop round the shop and bring one back , i say . is that ok ? enforcer says he must check with boss . comes back . says boss says no soap . i ' m pissed . did i get a free coke ? or something ? maybe a sorry , even . how about nothing . later one of our party says she wants to take home a dessert she could hardly eat . ( the eyes-stomach thing ) . ok says our waiter . enforcer comes by and says boss says no soap . no desserts can leave permises . yeah , sure . just like the water . reckon they didn ' t have containter . hey , enforcer man , tell the boss i want to see him . nocando , says enforcer . the boss has gone home . turn the lights off at this joint . i ' m done . 
i don ' t quite understand the comparisons to chipotle beyond the minimalist decor and similar price points . first , the rice . sure , i like cilantro and lime , but i don ' t like undercooked white rice in my burrito . i like my rice cooked in chicken stock when it ' s being stuffed into a burrito . the beans ? i don ' t see too much of a difference . the meats ? chipotle ain ' t bad , but i just always find dt ' s seasoning of their meats to be spot-on , and more often than not , they understand how to form a beautiful crust on their meat while keeping it juicy and tender . the salsas ? i ' d say both pico de gallo ' s are comparable , and while chipotle does have decent salsas , corporate would never let them serve a habanero salsa like dt ' s . i respect dos toros on that principle alone . to me , though , the kicker is the tortilla . the corn tortillas used for dt ' s tacos are simply bomb , and the flour tortillas puts chipotle ' s to absolute shame . not trying to hate on chipotle- i just strongly believe that dos toros is much , much tastier . 
really good . and cheap . our entire group of N ordered the pad thai and no joke it was on the table in N minutes on a moderately busy tuesday night . simple but pleasant decor . the only complaint i have is that i probably waited N minutes for the waiter to refill my water . other than that great experience . 
we ' ve had better thai food at some smaller thai restaurants . not saying that the food is lacking anything but the place is definitely overrated . not worth the N min wait for a table . 
very good food , good sizes , and i always enjoy the service . pretty cheap as well . always have a good experience there ! 
i recently dined at blend on the water . i must say i was in aw with the restaurant it self it was beautiful with breath taking views . the service is extremely attentive from the moment you walk in and your greeted by syeda at the deskshe is very sweet welcoming efficient and professional . i was accommodated as promptly as possible considering it was a saturday night and my party did not have a reservation . we even received a text when our table was ready . the server michelle was truly awesome very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly and made us feel comfortable . michelle even noticed our food was taking too long and with out us having to ask she came told us that she would find out what was taking so long . i ' ve been in the hospitality industry for quite sometime and that kind of initiative could turn a bad situation right around which it did . the spiced shrimp were to die for i honestly think it should be an entree as i could not get enough , next time i go i will just order three of those . we ordered the churrasco and the pollo a la plancha . the churrasco was cooked just as i ordered and it was succulent and juicy but smaller than i had imagined very thin but other wise yummy . the pollo a la plancha which by definition should be grilled , it was not , might of been poached ( truth in menu laws people ) but my friend said it was still very good although she preferred my chimichurri sauce to her mystery sauce . over all it was a great experience , i did forget to mention how delicious they ' re passion fruit margaritas are omg . i would definitely return and recommend it to my friends . 
this was our second visit to osteria giotto . the first time ( roughly N years ago ) , we fell in love with this place - great food , great atmosphere , great service . so when we ended up in montclair , this was our first dinner choice . and it was a disappointment . still great atmosphere , still great service and large portions but the food was . . . meh . mussels and claims appetizer - great , specially the broth for dipping the delicious breads . but here comes the disappointment . my spinach salad - boring , just a pile of spinach with few walnuts and tomatoes . our older son ' s pasta with lobster and shrimp was . . . well . . . too much of seafood taste to a point of you could not taste the pasta . my husband ' s pasta dish with sausage and mushrooms - salty and under cooked . the only dish i really liked was the lasagna - rich , smooth , delicious . sorry , giotto , maybe better in another N years . ) 
i went to nai two months ago with an old friend . it ' s a cute place tucked underground off of Nst ave and Nth . going off the server ' s recommendation , we did enjoy the gambas al ajillo pretty much anytime you douse something in garlic sauce i ' m gonna like it . the rest of the meal was enjoyable - i ' ve had most of the dishes before , but i remember enjoying every one . we also showed up right at the tail end of happy hour - we ended up getting a discounted pitcher of sangria , and it was pretty good ( i ' ve never really had a sangria i ' ve loved , but this was close ) . prices were reasonable for the neighborhood . i ' d recommend this place for folks looking for tapas in the area . would be good with a very small group or on a date . 
i ' m pretty fond of pizzeria vetri for more sentimental reasons , but the food here is great as well ! i ' ve tried all of the following pizzas - margherita , crudo , melanzana , salsiccia , and quattro formaggi - and they have all been consistently fantastic . i think they ' re reasonably priced as well - each pizza comes with N pre-cut slices and i was stuffed after N . 
since graduate hospital is continually gearing itself towards N-and early N-somethings , the sidecar bar and grille is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and is such a fun space for socializing , great food and drinks not to mention prompt and friendly service ! i stopped in for a happy hour hosted by a local organization called spectrum , and was very pleased with my experience . we ordered a few shareable appetizers for the whole group ( including amazing pretzel-crusted chicken bites with a tangy honey mustard dipping sauce ) and i settled on a hard cider that i really enjoyed . hoping to come back soon for a burger ! 
we had our office party here and it was just an amazing experience . thumbs up on the N . food - excellent balance with quality engraved in each aspect of the food . the food tastes brilliant , and little touches and attention to detail on presentation just makes the food even better . N . drinks - perfect drinks with a touch of class . love the metal steel straws that come with every drink N . service - even though it was a large party , services were just on the mark . from the host of the establishment taking out coats , to the servers who were patient , and ensuring that everyone was attended to , and following up to ensure that they had everything they needed . N . decor - i have been to many many indian places but this one just exudes class and you can see how well thought out the everything was . this is a place i can hang out with friends and family and just relax to good drinks and foof . . . or have a formal client meeting as well . N . attention to detail - just what it says . . . . embedded into everything that they do . in short , hands down one of the best indian restaurants i have been to ! 
this place is great ! nick the owner will make you feel right at home . never met him before last night and already , he ' s like an old friend . tavola is casual but classy . they have a very nice selection of wines which are all reasonably priced from N and up . our party of four started off with the wild boar meatballs and grilled calamari for appetizers . the meatballs were so light and full of flavor . they may be the best i ' ve ever had in a restaurant . that ' s because my italian dad really made the best i have ever had . the squid was perfectly grilled . not over cooked and rubbery , but soft and tender . simply delicious ! the two appetizers were plenty big enough for all of us to share . next we ordered four different pizzas for all to share . without describing each pizza i will say they were all great ! especially the parma and the four cheese pizzas . tavola ' s pizza reminded me of pizza i ' ve had in milano , italy ! i almost took a half star off my rating because the staff did not remove empty appetizer dishes before bring on the pizzas . four pizzas take up a lot of space . it was a little chaotic for a moment . however , the food and atmosphere was so good i decided to overlook that one little thing . perhaps they ' ll read this and fix that small problem . all in all , i will make this one of my regular italian eateries from now on . what a great place ! 
this is my very first yelp review ! i figured i rely on the yelp community so heavily its time for me to contribute . la sirene is a gem of a restaurant . listen up boys this is a place your girl will love . the food is delcious , the atomsphere is quite romantic and its byob with no corkage fee . if you want to look like a stud bring a nice bottle of champagne and take command of the menu . order the goat cheese tart to start , either the tournedos rossini or the magret de canard gras and for dessert a nice glass of champagne and profiteroles . her palate will be thoroughly pleased . need i remind you what happens when you have a happy woman on your arm ) ? 
i could have gotten a cheeseburger off of mcdonald ' s dollar menu and a wendy ' s frosty and saved myself the N difference . would have tasted better too . 
super trendy , and equally delicious restaurants are hard to find . and l ' artusi has mastered just that ! fast and kind service , check ! open kitchen , check ! delicious potato and lamb gnocchi . . . check from the appetizers down to our dessert wine we were all extremely pleased . i have no complaints about this place wait . . it could be closer to my apartment ! 
great new restaurant in sunset park adding a much needed american latin bistro menu with an incredible brunch staff is great and very attentive desserts and pastries are well done they just opened for dinner in late march but have been open for mornings and afternoons for quite some time . i highly recommend this restaurant and i am looking forward to the back yard to be open for al fresco dining soon
this place is awesome . the food is so good that will put a big smile on your face . i order from fabio at least twice a week and he never disappoints me . tonight i had the ' special ' dish of trofie pasta with pesto sauce made with arugula , cherry tomatoes and burrata and then lamb chops with broccoli rabe . this guy is a genius ! ! i very seldom write reviews , but the food tonight was so good that pushed me to finally leave a feedback . . . ordering from the regular menu is a good choice , ordering among the specials ' fabio creates every day is a must ! cozy place , friendly service , casual atmosphere , reasonsble prices given the high quality of ingredients . highly recommended ! ! chapeau ! 
great place for drinks and friends ! ! 
i love that we can just pop in without a reservation ! we stopped in on a tuesday evening . it was Np , and all the regular tables were full , but there you can have the full dinner menu at the bar or at the kitchen counter . both areas have plenty to seating . . . and the ample spacing between chairs really makes a comfortable dining experience . it was the hottest day so far for this season ( Nf ) , and the restaurant with it ' s open kitchen was perfectly comfortable . they must have some high-tech air conditioning system , because the temperature at the kitchen counter felt the same as anywhere else in the restaurant . now , the food . . . we decided on N of their small plates . . . the octopus , baby gem lettuce , fresh mozzarella , and beef tartare . the octopus was perfectly flavored and tender . the baby gem lettuce had a very distinct walnut puree as a base - delicious and intriguing . fresh mozzarella had a perfect consistent texture . and the beef tartare was seasoned and flavorful . i would absolutely order these again . . . maybe not share next time though . - ) totally going to pop in for drinks and some small plates in the future . . . vs only for dinner . 
great food . even though its touristy it is still good quality family style italian food . big portions , so split everything with the table . 
i love this place . my burger is always perfectly done , they always have a short , but expertly curated tap list and the staff is welcoming and friendly . the bartenders know definitely know what they are talking about . there have been a few instances when i haven ' t liked some of the new additions to the menu ( due to perhaps a bit too much experimentation in the kitchen ? ) , but the staff always makes it right if you aren ' t satisfied . i ' ll always have a soft spot for memphis since i got engaged here , but what will keep me keep going back is the friendly staff , knowledgeable bartenders , deep fried pickles , great beer and great burgers . 
came in for a weekday brunch - had the eggs norwegian and an apple frittata with bacon and gruy re . everything was delicious and priced right ( each dish was right around N ) . would definitely recommend , but not if you ' re looking for anything really light ) 
umm . . . i can ' t decide if i hate you or love you and it ' s for the same reason . you ' re soo delicious but soo far away ( from downtown brooklyn ) . also , the staff is awesome ( i was there this sat . , so whomever the guy is who poured me some super dry sake and the female server who was patient , unpretentious and just all around perfect , you ' re incredible ) . i was there for lunch and there was some maintenance work going on , which probably would have annoyed me , but i was too entranced with my tasty morsels to notice care ( but i ' m also pretty forgiving of almost all noises short of making my ears bleed and crying babies ) . only improvement would be to take credit cards ( but again , probably better that you didn ' t as i could have seriously ordered everything off the menu twice over , except for the eels . . . they ' re just gross sea snakes ) . 
i ' ve been to bangkok gardens a couple of times , and both times i really enjoyed it . this is a lot coming from me since i ' m not a huge fan of thai food , so take this review for what it ' s worth . the service was good , the food was tasty and served in large portions , and i didn ' t leave there feeling hungry or disappointed in what i spent . overall , it ' s a solid experience at a reasonable price . recommended to most , even those who are new to thai food or haven ' t been a fan of it in the past . 
classic french bistro . when we walked in , we were transported ! even the waiters wear aprons and ties . we came for lunch midweek , and it was packed . beautiful decor , lots of old french posters and prints on the walls , a bar with an old-fashioned marble or granite top , not the wild colorful stuff you see nowadays , just plain off-white . many of the menu items are classics , and a few of them are even kind of crunchy-vermonty . we dined on the salade nicoise ( giant hunks of seared tuna ) , and a sandwich that was decidedly not french ( it had jalapenos in it and pickled cabbage ) . and of course , the truffle fries , served in a cone-shaped basket . absolutely divine . perfectly cooked and not greasy . one gripe is that the wine list could be a lot better . it had a lot of cheap american crap and not enough bargain-priced french favorites or even more expensive french wines . the wine we had , a cotes du rhone , was not well balanced and lacking in depth . 
polite if not exactly speedy service . reasonable food as far as terminal food is concerned . you could do much worse . 
great place plenty of seating me and my fellow workers had our buisnes meeting here and the food was what made it enjoyable . 
this place is the best brazilian food you can get around philly ! we ' ve been there over N times and we are always happy ! loooooove this place ! meat is great , salad bar is wonderful , service is also the best ! 
what we ate- the chef ' s sushi recommendations came here with my boyfriend and his parents when they were visiting . he and his dad had come once before and absolutely loved it . and this time was no different . we had a nice quiet table and promptly ordered sake . after that we simply asked for the chef ' s recommendations for sushi and sat back and waited . in short , it was all delicious . some of the best sushi in the city hands down . put at a price tag you might expect which makes it ( sadly ) a rare indulgence . enjoy ! 
love stopping in for drinks and appetizers ! delicious guacamole and fish tacos . it ' s a fun atmosphere , very busy but i ' ve always had good service . 
we got to the place after a broadway show and my wife was hungry ! ! ! so we followed the smell and found this amazing place . you will get an huge slice of pizza ! ! my wife said that she never taste that kind of pizza ! when we stayed in order to discover the secret we saw the huge amount of better that they are using . amazing
i think this place is so underrated . i ' ve never had a bad meal here . their salads are great - my favorite is the asian salad topped with ahi tuna and seaweed salad . the atmosphere is relaxed with karaoke on the weekends and an older crowd . the prices are reasonable and it is never too crowded to get a seat . 
came here with a girlfriend on a sat night . it was really fun , lively crowd , good drinks cool vibe . check it out . 
very good quality . i love the egg on the top of the soup . nice touch . i ' ll be back
great atmosphere and food ! i always get seafood tofu soup , it comes with rice as many other korean restaurants . i also love their pancakes , it ' s a bit pricy but worthy . everytime i want korean food , i always go bcd heheh 
coming from nyc and taking the bus for the first time it wasnt a difficult place to find . it ' s right across the street from ihop shopping center . walk in and you see everyone preparing sandwiches or cooking up the pork beef . had the roast pork sandwich with spinach and provolone cheese . went into the tent area and grab a seat at one of the tables and just started eating up the sandwich . it ' s really , really good . the pork was a little salty in a good way . i had the large sandwich and i just barely finished the sandwich . i was full about N N ' s of the way through . very good , next time im in philly i will try the cheese streak . 
great little slider spot . they serve delicious sliders and fries , and since they ' re so small and cheap ( proportionally ) you can try them all ! just watch yourself though , for the sake of your arteries . 
place is filthy . no air . full of smoke from burning pizzas . incredibly rude staff . pizza is just hyped up by in what i assume to be non nyers who grew up on dominos . what ' s the appeal about an old guy who ' s as slow as molasses making pizza ? N a slice ? are you people mad ? people rave about the cheese . next time you go pay attention . he uses belgioso fresh mozzarella and polly-o plus parmagianno regianno . wake up folks . you ' re being conned . oh yeah and this is from the nyc . gov website - dept of health aN-restaurantinspectio violations from N N N inspection violation points N violations were cited in the following area ( s ) . sanitary violations N ) evidence of rats or live rats present in facility ' s food and or non-food areas . N ) evidence of roaches or live roaches present in facility ' s food and or non-food areas . N ) refrigerated or hot holding equipment to keep potentially hazardous foods at required temperatures not provided . 
does everything have to be so big ? ? we had a party of N ( mix of girls and guys ) and we ordered N appetizers and N entree dishes and we barely finished it . i don ' t know what ' s with the fad of big portions ( ok make your money ' s worth ) but it doesn ' t make sense if no one can finish it . the place is incredibly loud and i don ' t understand how people can still have conversations over dinner . not a great place for dates , but definitely a place for big families hosting parties . and yes , you will probably hear at least N birthday songs during the night . overall , it felt more like a buffet style dinner than a fine italian restaurant . 
hands down , one of the best burgers in nyc . . . and i am picky ! for pickle lovers . . . they get it right ! they don ' t give you soggy measly slices of pickles on your burger . . they cut the pickle from it ' s side and it ' s crunchy ! the meat is savory and juicy and oh my . . . burger heaven . . . order the " bar burger " . the staff is also very friendly and decor is not something you see very often in this city anymore . . . even though it ' s brand new it has a vintage feel to it . . . loved everything about it . 
dear walters , when you first opened we had such high hopes . now , after a year i ' m afraid your settling into a bland mediocrity that seems to take hold in so many fort greene restaurants . your menu has barely changed since you opened . it was a fine starter menu but its time to step it up . our most recent brunch included store bought oj , drippy and flavorless huevos rancheros and old arugula in the side salad . recombining the same ingredients you have in every other egg dish to make a breakfast burrito ' special ' is not so special . the two stars are because your location is great and the vibe is nice . you need to put more quality and care into the food if you want to remain a go-to spot for locals . 
 attention for all of those debating on whether or not to go to this place , please read first i enjoy italian food , very , very much . as a person of italian heritege and native of south philadelphia , i must say that this was the worst piece of sh t i have ever eaten . antipasti was without a doubt too cold upon serving , and the servers were the most rude i have ever encountered . when i say this food was bad , i mean i would not serve it to a roach . not to mention the short little mario brother look alike manager owner who was so obnoxiously rude when we told him we were not satisfied with the meal . this man should be ashamed to own such a shit hole of a restraunt . i discourage anyone who is having thoughts of attending this place . please , your better off buying and popping in the microwave a mama leone ' s frozen pizza from your local grocery store , then subjecting yourself to this crap and sh tty service you will find at le virtu . p . s . i think the owner manager needs a major lesson in the service industry . 
some dishes are spic and intense but great if you want something different and original . this hole in the wall restaurant exudes a type of elegance that this industrial part of brooklyn just hasn ' t really seen before . food is great , service was nice , authentic home feel somehow and i love the windows ! tip go during the week for lunch , prices are cheaper
i went on last sunday with my friend . food was good but service was so bad ! because the lady who wears the blue t-shirt staff , stands near the counter is unfriendly ! no service mind at all . 
another great italian restaurant . been here a few times . i have tried a few different meals here but i love the veal . it melts in your mouth . always perfectly cooked . also , the mussels and asparagus app is cool and the bone marrow is a must try . if you are into seafood , i would recommend the wild stripe bass . staff here is very professional and this place is always packed . love everything about it . 
sea bass or filet . 
if awful food that makes you want to throw up , and surly hostess that doesn ' t seat you even though there are empty , unreserved seats available in plain sight , your idea of a fun evening in princeton , please go ! most . unsatisfying . meal . ever . 
hands down my favorite ramen place from coast to coast . i make it a must stop destination every time i visit ny . i love their ramen but i love those yummy pork buns just as much . expect a wait unless you visit at odd hours . service is pretty good considering how busy they are . pricey but worth it . 
love love love ! for birthdays , they sing a crazy song and you get to ride the horsey ) this place is a favorite and i go out during the weekends to stop by . there is a lot of food and we always order too much and have to take it home . 
fantastic ramen here . some of the best i ' ve had outside of japan . i usually go for the shoyu ramen and it has never disappointed me . big slices of pork , perfect noodles and tasty broth . also they don ' t seem to have a wait very often , so a good place to just pop into if you are in the area . 
came here for the northside event and i have to say that i really love this place . i do have to note that i was liquored up on free jameson for three days straight so . . . this place is decently clean and had some great bartenders who kept their cool and tried their best to get everyone ' s orders . they were literally mobbed on all sides of the bar . the bathroom line was never that long and i like that there are sinks outside the bathrooms just in case you want to wash your hands without waiting on line . another great thing , which i don ' t think most people appreciate is that there was enough toilet paper and paper towels . with the amount of traffic that this place was getting i imagine this was no small feat . the heat in the back of the bar was pretty unbearable at times because of the sheer volume of human bodies crammed in there but the front of the bar was where it was at . they had the front wide open and laid out with tables and benches . there was a cool , balmy breeze and board games galore to whet your appetite for kicking someone ' s ass . sack toss was being played next to the sidewalk and it was just generally a great atmosphere . service was a , there were people running around collecting empty glasses and plates . this place was as tidy as it could be with that many drunk people . i was thoroughly impressed . music was varied but i ' m not sure if that ' s the norm for this place or whether they had special djs for the event . sunday night was the best in my opinion because of the old school ' Ns hip hop . i ' ll be back . listen , anywhere i can get my liquor on and play jenga is my type of establishment . 
had the pleasure of dining in vonda ' s last week . had fried tilapia , collards , yams , and corn bread . the food was slammin ' ! ! ! ! will definitely be returning . 
like coming here for the wings . . . better than planet wings wings and the owner staff is welcoming . still have to try the burger . world just recommend , for a better profit , a more active location like near broad and market or along bloomfield ave . . . . . jeez i keep forgetting to get my card stamped each time lol . that ' s a nice old time nostalgic thing i like as well . 
i came here with a friend on friday night for dinner . we were seated at the middle communal table which was alright , but next time i go i ' m going to try and sit at the bar or one of the tables on the side . the communal table seats are a little too close to the other parties and a little too far across the table . i ordered the squid ink noodles house wine and he had the thai burger and a tiger beer . i liked the flavors of mine a lot , and even though the portions don ' t look big , they definitely fill you up . the presentation of the dishes is nicely done as well - the burger came on one of their tree trunk plates . ngam is a trendy restaurant with a different take on the regular thai food you are used to seeing in new york . if you are looking for a little more familiar and a quieter place , i would recommend bodhi tree a few blocks away , but ngam is definitely worth checking out ! 
i just had dinner at this place last night . the service was excellent . the place was small but cute . the food was very good . however , i still think zero otto nove is the best italian food i have ever had in new york . they are located in little italy in the bronx . it ' s totally worth the trip . they also have a new location in new york city , but i have never been there . if you are in the area and want good italian food this would be a great place to have it . 
went there on a date and though i do not particularly like greek food , the meal was great . i had fish of course ( seared striped bass ) and loved it . will go there again with my mates and sample some thing else from the extensive yet not to overwhelming menu . 
my favorite place ! i love it when you go out and get food you could not have made yourself ! this is just how this place is . . ps you have to try the edamame dumplings . 
i ' m from the south and was born in new orleans , so when i came across this place online , i had to try it out . the girlfriend and i came on saturday night , and had to wait about fifteen minutes or so for a table . the restaurant is very small , so although we were able to wait by the bar with drinks , we constantly had to move to allow the wait staff to get back and forth from the kitchen- not fun . the beer selection was decent but not great- i expected more abita and less of the standard upper-middle beers ( e . g . , hitichino ) . everything on the menu looked tasty , and it was difficult to decide what to get . after some deliberation , we decided to split orders of the catfish and jambalaya , and got a side of cornbread since it was less than a dollar . we also ordered a side of fries . the food came out in about fifteen minutes . while we waited we saw a burger being taken to the table next to us that looked very good . i ' m considering getting it on my next visit . the catfish was good but not great , as it didn ' t have enough spice for my taste . the jambalaya was excellent- not too watery , and the ingredients were quality . the fries were also great . the cornbread was classified as jalapeno cornbread , which we thought meant that jalapenos would be baked into the bread . however , instead the bread merely had jalapeno flaked over the top of it , and simply wasn ' t very tasty . even given the price , i wouldn ' t recommend the cornbread . we didn ' t experience any of the issues that other reviewers had . we didn ' t have difficulty reading the menu simply because it was on a wall . nor did we have trouble getting food or drinks . ultimately , we were very satisfied with great jones . the excellent jambalaya and fries more than made up for the relative lack of space . we plan on returning again in the next few months . final rating- four stars . 
excellent spot for a bottle of wine and sitting out on rittenhouse square any night of the week
it ' s got that old school , thin crust , grease dripping flavor . standard toppings , nothing special . but that adds to the guarantee . fountain drinks , cold cuts , and manicotti to die for . chicken parm and veal parm---perfection . and back to the old school feeling , steak style french fries . hey , i ' s even got italian icees , straight outta the can ! marino ' s brand straight outta brooklyn ! can ' t go wrong , not the best neighborhood , so go during the day if you ' re the timid type . 
a must stop everytime you are in philly ! this isn ' t chi-chi ' s or taco bell , folks , so be prepared for authentic mexican food . i generally hate mexican food , because everything tastes the same to me . . . but this place is totally different . i have been here probably a dozen times and loved every time . they moved the location about N years ago , so . . . . if you havent been there in a while try again , it is much more up-scale than it was when it was a couple blocks south . make sure to make reservations , this place can get packed . 
the rustic italian decor made the atmosphere feel authentic . the thin crust pizza is the best i ' ve have in a long time . you don ' t feel stuffed at the end of it all , but are still completely satisfied . the spaghetti carbonara is one of the best dishes at luzzo ' s . 
they seem to specialise in fried chicken but also have a great selection of peruvian style ceviche . it was fresh and delicious . large portions , so you could easily share one between two with a side order of fried plantains to share . we overordered . no beer though . . ( 
currently my favorite hangout in town , this place seriously has it all excellent food ( try the pork belly tacos ! ) , great bartenders , cool tunes , and a comfortable neighborhood vibe . drinks and food are all reasonably priced , and there ' s even a nice dining room in the back for enjoying your grub sans-bar stool . come out for a drink and blare some oldies on the juke ! 
my family has been going here since it first opened up and it doesn ' t get any better ! regular pie i could live without but the sicilian . . delicious . even better is the chocolate , vanilla , pistachio spumoni on a warm day . go here ! 
i really liked the truffle mayo and the sliders are premium . of course the fries and yummy very small inside , with only one table to sit , so take togo
food is great , yes ! buuutt , why are people treating this place like a who ' s who club , when all it is , is a nice cozy eatery ? not worth standing in line for . i would only go in on a slow day when i can be seated right away and not deal with a crowd . 
great japanese establishment . loved the atmosphere . loved everything about it . atmosphere N star -cozy -great interior design -captures the " japaneseness " service N star - the waitress sarah was great ! - the hostess seemed annoyed with me - very japanese style waiting service food N star - ordered chicken skewer and i can say its the best one in town ! - also ordered this pig thing forgot the name but it was delicious . will come again . 
one of the worst places to order delivery from . i thought i would ' ve learned my mistake the first couple of times , but this is definitely the last time i order from them . they consistently take an hour over the allotted delivery time and when the food comes it ' s cold . then when you call them to ask where the order is , they put you on hold and hang up the phone . 
met a friend here for brunch . cute dining area , albeit a bit crowded . pretty great mediterranean . i had already had breakfast earlier , so i only got the crispy cabbage salad . i liked the combination of cumin and mint in the salad . it was quite refreshing and also decently sized . dining partner ordered the skirt steak and told me to trust him when i gave him a skeptical eye . when it came out it was super juicy and flavorful . yum ! great place . i plan on bringing the bf here . 
great service , staff is very friendly , food was well presented and tasty . the scallops with polenta were ok but not amazing the scallops were a bit too fishy for me
incredible sandwiches and you can bring beer in to wash it down ! 
it ' s . . . okay . not the best in the world . . . modern tastes better and has faster service . we stopped going to pepe ' s as much because they always have such a huge wait . next time another property in the neighborhood opens up , they should definitely buy it and have an additional dining room on the weekends . if you really want to try it , just go for an early lunch when they open and you ' ll get a seat and delicious pizza ( with less of the black char , if you don ' t like that ) . 
the food is not worth the N hour N minute wait for a table , and then almost an hour for the food to arrive . how long does it take to make hash and a cuban sandwich ? if crowds make you think the food is really good- go for it . i guess it makes good business sense to have people order lots of drinks while they wait and wait for a table or food while cheery smiling wait staff promise it will happen . otherwise , stay away . better food and drinks can be had at other solid restaurants without the hassles and hyperbole at N N the price . 
this place is beautiful , especially the outdoor seating . if you are seated outside , you have a view of a monet painting come to life ! i came here for lunch with the bf and his parents . the service was great and the food was good . best part is after dinner you can go walk around the sculpture garden which is absolutely amazing ! 
kinda like wawa , but with a little more variety ? i dunno . they had cranberry red bull and that ' s all i wanted . can ' t tell the difference between this place , spruce rana , jay ' s deli , etc . whatever forever . 
this place is absolutely delicious ! authentic indian ( i am indian ) and these taste exactly like the food my mother makes ! the spices , sauces and sambar is all on point . the idli and dosas are perfection and the price is ridiculously cheap ! took my yummy food to washington square park and had a relaxing lunch . so good ! i definitely recommend coming here . 
the decor and the selection of liquor is great . the service , unfortunately , not so great . i ' ve been there numerous times , and each time the bartender has acted arrogant and indifferent . ahh bartenders and their inflated egos . i wouldn ' t expect them to be friendly if they didn ' t expect me to leave a tip . 
thai-licious . we started our epic thai meal with the papaya salad and bbq beef . the papaya was super fresh , a little heavy on the peanuts for my liking but overall a good . the beef was excellent , the mint is a nice touch . since i ' m a sucker for thai noodle dishes our next course was all noodle . we went with the drunken noodle , which was good but not as good as the northern style curry noodles . i think this dish made our meal . our gluttony continued with soft shell crabs and an order of the fried fish with basil sauce . nothing beats an entire fish , head included , delivered to your table ! everyone knows how reliable and great the food is here . but the service just isn ' t up to par . it ' s a little off putting the disinterest the wait staff has . like others , it ' s not enough to keep me away though . 
came late on a thursday night and had to wait two hours until we were seated for an N pm dinner . however , the wait was definitely worth it . the meats sampled were delicious , fresh , and perfectly cooked . we also enjoyed a delicious bottle of cabernet , recommended to us by our friendly and helpful waitress . i would definitely come here again for a special occasion or recommend it to any meat-loving friends . 
food was fantastic , as usual , but service ( not sure one can call this ' service ' at that point ) was at a snail ' s pace . i had made reservations for my birthday two weeks before . we were N people and arrived on time . they told us that people on our table were about to pay - apparently that didn ' t happen for a good Nmin . instead of having us go someplace else for a drink and coming back for dinner , they kept coming back saying it was only gonna be another Nmin . they let all of us stand outside and wait , and the manager himself told us they would bring out the food very quickly to make up for it . i wasn ' t too thrilled about a rushed dinner , but should have insisted on that . . . the waitress could not have been slower , it was so frustrating . we had reservations at a bar later on and paid for it , almost lost our res , plus more people were gonna join us . everything got delayed by N . Nhrs ( ! ! ) - had we not been that many people , we would have left . they were obviously aware that some sort of compensation was appropriate , so they brought out two or three appetizers , which was nice but come on . . . first round of drinks would have been appropriate . it was the only one anyway , since we didn ' t have time for more anymore . . in a nutshell outstanding food at a great venue , but one of the worst services i ' ve ever experienced in the city ( on my bday ! ) , and a rather mingy compensation for a Nmin wait . their time warner location seems to have more skilled staff . 
get the fries . . . . they are to die for ! 
totally delicious ! 
if you are from philly and you haven ' t been to dinic ' s . . . shame on you . this place is the reason you go to reading terminal market . i have been here at least N times and have only gotten one thing . the roast pork sandwich is what they are known for and what they do so well . get the pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe and you will not regret it . my favorite pork sandwich in the city . . . although i have never been to john ' s roast pork ( it ' s on the list ) . 
i ' ve been going to tria for years and never have had a bad experience . best time to go is during " sunday school , " you can check out a new wines , beers , cheeses that change week to week and are a bit off the beaten path . it ' s great to have a wine bar with so much adventure that is still affordable - love trying new great wines . servers are friendly and know their stuff well - so trust their recommendations if you aren ' t sure where to start . 
wanted to give jb ' s more stars , but i did not have an enjoyable time the last time i was at this establishment . they always have awesome food . the cuban is outstanding and i love the fries . jb ' s always has some good beers on tap too . the waitstaff is usually extremely nice and responsive , but now to the horror story that was our so-called service . . . last friday night i was at johnny brenda ' s with some folks . my buddy ' s girlfriend ordered the baked mozzarella and she shared that with her friends . we wanted some , so we ordered the same dish . . . but what came out was some saucy monstrosity . the tiniest piece of mozzarella cheese looked like hawaii surrounded by a red pacific . this dish is supposed to come with fried polenta sticks , but we got two crusty pieces of bread instead . the bartender dropped it off and didn ' t even say sorry or anything that the N bowl of sauce was missing one of its main components . . now my complaint wasn ' t about the food , it is more about this horrible woman ' s service . by far the worst bartender server i have ever encountered . when my friend asked her about the dish , she gave him major attitude and said , " most people just take what they ' re given . " most ridiculous shit ever said by someone who works in the food service industry . i ' ve worked at restaurants since i was N , and that is the greatest example of how not to treat your customers . it was cartoonish . oh and i also enjoyed the part when i was accused of bringing my own beer into the bar and then being " flagged " because we complained about our shitty service . your ass should be fired because you turned about eight loyal customers into eight crusty haters . 
omgg ! ! ! just returned from a great night at catfish , i came by with a co-worker and i instantly fell in love with the vibe , decor , and the staff . everyone was super friendly . my bartender was the oh-so-handsome scott - ( but i would never tell him that ) . i first ordered a pilsner ( fly - something ) and then a couple of whiskey sours ( i learned a thing or two about the different prep methods , lol ) and the best part - their fucking lamb was amazing ( i cant believe i just cursed on yelp . i hope the yelp gods forgive me ) lol . i will definitely return . say hello to your new regular ) 
just what the neighborhood needed . fantastic food at reasonable prices . the staff was friendly and extremely helpful . the atmosophere is trendy but still really cozy . had the junk salad first time and it was fresh and delicious , second time back i went with the gnocchi lasagna which could very well be their signature dish as far as i am concerned . portions were pertfect . overall a great experience and a welcome addition to the area . can ' t wait to try everything the quick fixx has to offer ! ! ! 
went here with some friends for the N lunch special ( w soft drink ) on a weekday , and the place was pretty much empty with the exception of one couple at the bar . the soft drinks are refilled . we had some different orders the crab cake , croque-monsieur , sandwich au boeuf , ravioli , and steak tartare . a la carte items included the trout with lemon butter sauce ( was surprised but pleased to get a whole fish - not so pleased about the tail that was cut off yet still remaining on the plate ) and pasta with clams mussels ( N each ) . the lunch special is fine if you ' re after a sandwich , but otherwise , you ' ll likely want something more , which is where they make money off of you with the a la carte items . the floating island dessert ( N ) was okay the raspberry coulis sauce was kind of sour . there are much better french places that i would pay more for , but this place is okay for a quick lunch . i most likely won ' t be back , but service ( by the bartender ) was very good , as well as food presentation . whether or not this place is a good deal depends on how you choose to eat . 
place is overcrowded , a tourist trap but the pizza is excellent
neat pub featuring a fair selection of craft brews . lowlit , loud , and inherently comfy . didn ' t eat , although the food menu looks good . review is on beer selection and atmosphere , both of which are pretty great ! 
i love halal and finding good halal is important to me . in one weekend i tried halal guys in astoria , the halal cart on Nst and continental in forest hills , and sammy ' s on Nth and broadway . honestly , any of these halal carts will make you want to say a quick prayer of thanks to the halal gods . however , halal guys takes the cake for perfect rice , chicken , hot sauce , and white sauce . the smell emanating from my styrofoam container was so enticing i couldn ' t wait till home to try the chicken over rice . i ate the entire thing in my car parked right by the cart . no shame . 
their burger is awesome . they have delicious onion rings . they have beer . they have nice staff . what more do you need ? oh yeah , their bathroom is clean . there ya go , N stars . 
could have been better , could have been worse . the guacamole and drinks were tasty and the bar is fun to hang out at but the overall food was just ok . 
i had heard great things about zahav but my expectations were surpassed ! i went here during philly ' s restaurant week and even though the restaurant was crowded , we were seated promptly . the service was impeccable . our server always had an eye out for us and was almost immediately there if we needed something . the food was also unbelievable , i tried N ) salatim and hummus with laffa N ) pastilla N ) fried cauliflower N ) duck kobab N ) konafi all of them were absolutely amazing but i strongly recommend the duck kobab . at the end of our meal , we were given N gift cards for a future visit . i honestly can ' t wait to go back ! 
a little flashy , but i love the patriotic atmosphere . it is a staple of philadelphia , and i personally think its cheese steaks are way better than pat ' s . there is always a huge line but it moves pretty fast . it is also a great place to satisfy your hunger after a long night of partying . i would recommend the wiz wit
i ' ve been here for breakfast and lunch and it ' s been packed both times . the inside is cozy with a mini bar area . the meal i can remember was the grilled egg sandwich , i had with bacon . it was a good size portion and i also had a pi a colada with it which was fantastic . it ' s a little pricey but you definitely get your money ' s worth . 
i ' ve been to this tiny little italian nook twice . once for drinks on a saturday and another time for a lite dinner . both times it was practically empty . the decor is pretty chic , very lounge yet comfortable . very italian vibe . not quite " godfather " but not " staten island jersey shore " either . i had the sangria and long island , lets just say i ' ve had better . the chicken pesto panini with a arugula salad was excellent . even though its not the most difficult thing to mess up , i would have it again . we also had the cured beef . my bf loved it and said it was flavorful and had a good consistency not tough at all , like he expected . he would definitely have it again . the menu was small just like the place . the service was great . as well as the decor . this is a great place for a date or a lite dinner before a night out . this place is too small to host a dinner party at and they charge an N gratuity to parties of N or more , which is ridiculous considering its more of a nite bistro feel than anything else because the open at Npm . also , they only have happy hour mon . weds . and fri . great atmosphere for a date nite ) 
this is one of the best places to go to have lunch in the midtown area . the sandwiches salads are good and the lunch special is great for a lot of variety . breakfasts are tasty as well - muffins and especially the croissants in a number of varieties ( nutella , cream , sugar , jam , almond , whole wheat , plain ) . they have some kind of dessert happy hour which means that the desserts sell out in the late afternoon . it gets quite crowded at peak lunch hours though so it can be hard to get a table . 
being from europe it is difficult to find the food that you are used to . that is why we love eataly . the pasta , the bread , the meat , the cheese , it all tastes like home and somethings even better ! their hot chocolate is divine and they icecream to die for . the only reason i do not always get icecream there every chance i get is because the number of people in line to get it is somewhat disencouraging . 
it ' s taken me years to get here , but it ' s truly not overrated . from eggs to salad , it ' s a delightful lunch place , great ambiance . like all mcnally spots , a little loud , but that ' s his thing . i do not approve of places who have bathroom attendants , which is my one real knock on this joint . 
today was my Nth visit to the restaurant and was impressed by the consistency in food quality , taste and cleanliness of the restaurant . had a guest couple with us and we were all happy with all the dishes we ordered . paneer methi tikki was new in the menu and was really worth trying . 
this is actual thai food ! the soups are very tasty and as a vegetarian , i felt i had a ton of options to choose from . none of the food we ordered was too heavy , all light , delicious , and obviously fresh . i ordered the rama , which was amazing . our waitress was the only one in the whole restaurant for lunch during the week , and she was never neglectful . i would highly recommend this to any person who can appreciate real , well-made thai food for a great price . 
so delicious . the chicken soup cured my cold back in january . i also really love all the sweetened hot chocolate . the traditional hot chocolate was an experience too but obviously a different flavor from american sweet hot chocolate . 
pizza brain now offers delivery , more seating , and three great new pizzas a bacon and brussel sprout red pie a slow cooked brisket , blue cheese , and horseradish one and a baked potato pie ( fingerlings , bacon , cheddar , goat , rosemary , and scallions ) . it keeps getting better . great vibe and staff too ! a very warm place . my father-in-law and i ate a whole pie together--and felt great after ! 
always a happy customer when i leave . service is always great . food is yummy ! i love the pork belly app . but theres only N per order . ramen taste fresh
i hadn ' t been to nauna ' s for a few months but was invited to a bridal shower that was being held there last week . everything was excellent ! the shrimp francese was perfect and the fried calamari mented in your mouth . many of the guests were from out of town ( central jersey ) and quite a few of them plan to return for dinner because everything was so well prepared served . kudos to our servers ( diego angel ) for doing such a good job ! 
i don ' t speak a single word of spanish . the dominican women behind the counter , their aprons on , their hands digging into the pots overflowing plates of beans , rice and stew , they knew . it was obvious . a woman put the platter in front of me and raised an eyebrow . i smiled . she didn ' t . well , i didn ' t mind . i sat at the counter and attacked my plate like i had never seen food before . the rice and beans melted in my mouth . the beef stew fell apart before i could touch it . the baked chicken was the juiciest i ' ve ever had . the flavors were brilliant , succulent and satisfying . ten minutes later , my friends nudged their leftovers around their plate , held their stomachs and groaned . not me . i scraped off every last grain of rice and licked my lips . i didn ' t need to speak a word of spanish . it didn ' t matter . the dominican ladies and i exchanged smiles . they knew what i meant . it was obvious . 
the sweetest and kindest crepe artists work here ! they ' re all so genuine , nice and attentive . i ordered N azuki berries and it was the best in looks and taste . there ' s no way to say this humbly but my friends ordered other ones on the sweets menu and were drooling over mine ! the crepe came with a generous scoop of matcha green tea ice cream , red beans , chocolate pocky sticks and strawberries ( i added bananas to mine cus you know , need my potassium . . ) . eight turn crepe belongs at disneyland ( hint hint open a shop in california , pls ! ) . they have their crepe models stored in what holds the roses in disney ' s beauty and the beast ! drop your responsibilities today and be N-turn ' s guest ! 
had brunch here , if N Npm counts as brunch . this is the best italian food i ' ve had mainly because it tasted real and unprocessed . the food was hearty and the spices used were in balance and made the food stand out . the decor of supper is cozy and has a lot of little areas to hid out . i ' m not a big fan of going out for italian or steak because i think you can make those foods at home just as easy , but the exception is when you have food as good as this , mixed with a good neighborhood location and funky ambiance . i would go again if i found myself in nyc . 
rude service with my wife will never order there again real arrogant was trying to find out what was their special and person just was like there is none and just plain nasty
single best service i have ever experienced . the dudes who run this place are the same who take your orders and personally recommend explain their dishes . the food here is out-of-this world , too everything is a " best you ' ve ever had " --take the sable and challah , for example that must be what a lox ' n ' bagel post-enlightenment tastes like . i will also especially recommend their lafa , a must , and their beef cheeks , which were potentially the single most flavorful and tender cut of meat i ' ve ever eaten . one negative i see is the price . that said , by coming here and paying for the excellent service , food , atmosphere , and overall attention to detail , you are truly voting with your fork . plus , we got tons of free stuff like a beer , iced tea , and a dessert ! but i guess you just deserve that after paying N for two small ( but delish ! ) iced teas . . . 
cheap , good , deliciousness . enter the store that is full of vibrance , cooks and servers shouting across the rooms in chinese . i ordered the roasted duck wonton noodles , which is N . N . the hot tea is super hot , which i could not drink until the end of the meal . duck was cooked well , except i wish there were no bones to pick out . the wonton has shrimps in it , and goes well with the mild broth . there is plenty of noodle , which i could not finish , but it is there to fill your stomach ! 
a friend of mine introduced me to this establishment the last time we hung out downtown , and i just had to return . this is a small and cozy establishment which offers plenty of food for a reasonable price ( for center city philadelphia ) . the food is , of course , delicious ! if you want to impress your friends with your chopstick skills , there ' s ample opportunity to do so if you eat in , you get nice plastic chopsticks with a huge spoon , but to go , you receive the typical disposable wooden chopsticks ( as well as regular utensils if you need them ) . if you get food to go , be prepared to take out a sizeable bag o ' stuff , especially if you go for the special that they have up front ( argh , i forgot the name , but i had the miso flavor ) . the staff is willing to explain what each option is . there don ' t appear to be any paper menus , but everything is posted on the dry erase boards to the left of the counter . so if you have a hankering for true ramen food that ' s not the cheap dorm room staple that most people are familiar with , i recommend stopping by this restaurant . honestly , the main thing that makes me give this restaurant N starts instead of N stars is the fact that they only accept cash , which can be quite the bummer if you don ' t typically carry a lot of cash around . 
i read good things about red eye and decided to check it out tonight . upon walking in , it was a little smaller than i expected , but cute . they had a pretty good menu of food options for a smaller place but i decided to just order a dirty chai , which smelled and tasted delicious ! i love the fact that it ' s open until N p . m . most nights as it ' s a great alternative to a bar or crowded restaurant if you ' re looking for a quiet place to go with a friend or on a date . i will definitely be back ! 
food was ok , drinks were ok as well . a great place to go with friends for a bite and a drink reasonable prices . 
village whiskey is one of those unpretentious hole-in-the-wall places that an out-of-towner would almost be disappointed to be taken to by a local . " i ' m in philly and you ' re taking me here ? " is what came to mind when i was in town visiting an old high school friend and was taken there . the restaurant is really just a bar and cramped eating area . i was a tad weary but then again i was there to see her , so i was game . when the food came out however , i was blown away . this place by far has the best burger i have ever had , anywhere . part of it has to do with their buns , the other part is how moist their beef patty is . . . whatever it is , it works and i can ' t wait to go back to philly for another one . 
best burgers in the city
my wife and i went to juniors for some desert after going to a broadway show . it was around Npm and the place was packed ! i ordered the devils food cheesecake , while my wife ordered some steak fries and the raspberry swirl cheesecake , we both really like them ! the cheesecake is rich and the pieces are pretty big . the service was good and we will go back ! 
it ' s places like momofuku ssam bar that make me proud to be a new yorker . no pretense . no fuss . just the best pork buns you will ever have in your life . 
the burgers were pretty good . a bit burnt around the edges , however . fun to try at least once ! 
this place was quiet , cute , cheap , and best of all ? extremely good . go with friends and understand that you ' ll be passing plates around to taste everything . the food was so good i had to go back just two days later . the menu is huge , so when in doubt , close your eyes and point at something . don ' t worry , it ' ll be delicious . they ' re house wine is also good , for nights by yourself ( well , when you don ' t want the whole bottle by yourself ) . 
if you like seafood , this is simply one of the best lunch spots in princeton . the fish is excrutiatingly fresh and succulent . all the fish sandwiches are pretty much grilled to perfection . the grilled salmon sandwich at N is a must , as is the blackened catfish . portions are very generous - most sandwiches are served on an enormous bun with heaps of fresh tomatoes and lettuce . you can also add a delicious side of fries for N -- these fries have real flavor and are the perfect blend of crispy outside and tender inside ( a completely different beast from the bland , mealy , oily fries at hoagie haven ) . other delish offerings include fish chips , fish tacos , and raw oysters . on nice days you can sit al fresco outside , but otherwise you can sit at the lovely blue point grill next door ( the grill ' s noisy construction project is blissfully over ) . the only cons are the higher prices ( but you get what you pay for , quality ! ) and the sushi ( when offered ) uses delicious fish but sits on too-cold rice -- and once the corner of my sandwich bun was noticeably refrigerator-cold . but these are minor quibbles amidst all the seafood goodness . 
this is my favorite sushi restaurant in philly . the staff is incredibly nice and very quick with their service . the sushi rolls are absolutely divine . the stoplight roll is one of my favorites . the quality of the fish and the preparation presentation of the dishes are superb . the sashimi is also a quality dish . it tastes very fresh and has a great variety as well . if it ' s sushi you are after and you are in the area ( or not ! ) , definitely check out umai ! 
after reading some reviews and seeing the photos , we came here last week on thursday for my birthday dinner at N Npm . the decor was simple and pretty , and you get a great view of the manhattan skyline . we ordered chorizo mac cheese to start which we finished the moment it touched the table . our entrees were all very delicious and well done . i recommend you getting the pernil , churrasco pollo a la plancha . the bad the wait for our entrees took about an hour or so . our waitress alexis checked up on us a few times throughout the wait and updated us on when our food would be coming but it was hard to flag anyone down in between if we wanted refills on water or to order extra appetizers . she was very sweet and accommodating so i ' m not going to hold it against her for the lack of service . the restaurant just seemed understaffed for the amount of people seated . i wanted to like it because they are in such a great location and the food drinks were delicious . not sure if i want to come back again . 
the noodles were perfect , the broth delicious . the dumplings were out of this world and the seaweed salad gets two thumbs up . all of this at a great price . best place in chinatown . this will be a regular stop for me . 
yum ! risotto with mushrooms ! white cote du rh ne . that was a good choice for an afternoon meal . this is also a very good late night spot . 
this place is clean , quiet , and charming . big windows let in natural light , making it a wonderful place to go on a sunny day . i went here once and got a bagel with butter , a small tofu salad , and a big mug of coffee -- all for N . i was happy with all of it and hope to try something more substantial next time . it seems from the comments below that they used to have wifi . if they did , they don ' t anymore . i almost gave it N stars because of that , but then i realized that only an entitled brat demands wifi from every single dining establishment . this place is good as is . 
everything is excellent--we eat there about once a week and have never had a bad meal . just a wonderful neighborhood restaurant with great friendly service . so grateful to have antimo and family nearby . 
omg the sandwiches here are awesome . mozzarella sticks , chicken fingers , french fries and bacon stuffed inside the sandwich . the portions are good and theyve got lots of coupons discounts . i havent tried the tacos or breakfast menu yet , but i can only imagine how good they are . perfect place to go out after drinks or a night out , but also great for some greasy lunch lol . 
love this places charm and now with their soccer theme world cup in full effect ! wow they have gone to next level . all day drink specials . excellent apps including famous spicy wings . for mains you can ' t go wrong with any of the tacos ( chicken , fish etc ) . or a wonderful pulled pork sandwich . don ' t miss the mexican corn ! 
great pizza for not being on wooster st . try it you will love it . 
the neighborhood is so-so because right before we entered the restaurant , we witnessed a gang fight ! ah . . let ' s just hope the area will get better . meanwhile , it was dark inside . . . but the food was really great . we ordered the salad , escargot , mussels , mac and cheese , and many more appetizers . we were soooo full but because we shared everything - that is truly the best way to enjoy a little bit of everything . so awesome . and if you order it that way - you actually save more . thats how i see it . . . when it comes to larger groups . i am glad our friend recommended this place to us . it is really a place to try out . 
date-night feel . host in the front door was extremely friendly . he chatted with us while we waited for our seats which helped the time go by . there is a classier feel to this pizzeria . it ' s more of a place to take a significant other on a casual wednesday night . ordered the margarita pie with prosciutto . i love dry-cured ham . ingredients are fresh and the sauce is just right . pizza is crisp and thin and charred just slightly . definitely recommend to anyone . overall i would have to say i enjoyed juliana ' s over grimaldi ' s . there ' s more of a gourmet selection as opposed to that of grimaldi ' s . 
i have gone to carmines numerous times throughout the years for lunches and dinners . i have also brought visiting family friends here on special ocassions and have been pleased with the quality of the food . dining is served family style - all orders are huge and meant to be shared . the waiters for the most part have all been professional although on a few instances , i would have trouble getting their attention , something i have overlooked depending on how busy the place is . for appetizers , definitely try the spicy scarpariello wings ( N . N ) - very tasty and finger licking good for N-N hungry people . the outside is slightly crispy yet it ' s sufficiently soaked in some sort of sauce . ( not really spicy at all despite it ' s name - it ' s probably a mild spice if any . ) garlic bread with cheese is another favorite of mine . it usually comes out lightly baked ( N-N big sliced bread ) , but you can modify it depending on your taste buds and ask for the cheese and bread to be well done or not - either way is good . note , the garlic bread is oily so if you ' re watching your intake , this would be something to avoid . i ' ve had the calamari numerous times - crunchy as it should be and marinara is on the thicker side and good . the stuffed artichoke is just ok , probably one that i would not order again - one artichoke cut in half and baked with seasonings - N . too much work to get at the meat of the artichoke and it needed something more . some pieces were burnt here and there , not worth N as an appetizer in my opinion . i ' ve also had the cold and hot antipasto - nothing memorable , that i have only ordered both once throughout my years of coming here . i recall the hot appetizers being on the soggy side and not seeing it ' s N . N price tag worthiness . i do recall the hot appetizer containing clams casino and oreganata - maybe N-N total pieces and only one was tasty and the other was not . ( sorry i can ' t recall the specifics of this one , but like i said , i only ordered this once as it was not memorable at all ) . i ' ve had the mixed green salad and green caesar salad , both huge and good . if you like your salads , definitely give these a try - good for at least N-N people . my boyfriend loves the eggplant parm , but i got sick on it twice . one thing to note with any pasta dish is that if you request additional pasta or if your dish does not automatically come with pasta ( like meatballs ) , you will be charged N ( perhaps more since i last checked ) just for pasta on the side . i ' ve had the clam in both red and white sauce . both are excellent . i ' ve had the rigatoni broccolli , rigatoni w sausage brocolli , meatballs , and penna alla vodka on a couple of ocassions . the fact that i have ordered it on many ocassions pretty much sums it on whether i like it or not . can ' t go wrong with any of those except avoid the rigatoni brocolli and rigatoni w sausage brocolli if you are watching the amount of oil on your plate . ) i have had the giardiniera , rigatoni country style , manicotti ( " small " portion for carmine ' s style but still meant for sharing ) , lasagna and bolognese meat sauce ( on the dry side ) . chicken scarpariello ( meal ) is served with the entire chicken ( breasts , thighs , legs , etc ) chopped up . similar in flavor to the appetizer however the appetizers only have the standard wing pieces . tasty and served in a large portion ! the chicken parmigiana is excellent - note this does not come with pasta , so for N . N , i don ' t think you get your value for the amount . N ( depending on the size ) pounded flat chicken breasts . same goes for the chicken w lemon butter which has been a hit or miss with the flavor sometimes overkilled with the lemon . the last time i ordered this dish , it came out with only N pounded flat pieces sharable for only N not so hungry people , absolutely not worth N and no pasta to go along with either dish . shrimp fra diavolo ( N . N ) doesn ' t come with much shrimp N - N pieces . to make a meal out of it , you almost have to order pasta to go with it , an additional N . shrimp scampi was the same story . i don ' t recall the beef i ordered but i think it was the porterhouse pizzaola . it was excellent - huge portion but not something to get over and over again unless you make good cash . they have their daily specials which are sometimes not on the menu . chilean sea bass with shrimp is excellent . if that happens to be on the specials for the day , do order that as you will not be disappointed . pricey but good - shrimp are definitely jumbo and sea bass was flavorful and was not too flaky nor undercooked . i know i ' ve had many other things that i can ' t remember , so i won ' t even try to mention it . we always are amazed by the huge dessert plates that come out but by the time the appetizer ( s ) entrees are finished , we ' re so stuffed for dessert . i did manage to have the bread pudding once - i would recommend it , not the cannoli however . 
very disappointing ! we were visiting family in ct and went out of our way to stop there on our ride home due to the coverage this place received on the food network . what a drag - waited an hour for our burgers and they were average at best . i wouldn ' t wait an hour at any restaurant for my order . it was ridiculous . i ' d rather have a big mac next time . they do not serve basic condiments no ketchup , mustard , pickles - nothing ! the burgers were dry and would have benefited from some ketchup and mustard . decent quality ground beef but dry . and - the " cheese " on the cheeseburgers is " cheez-whiz " and i ' m not kidding . also - very cramped very few seats it ' s a small place which is fine but it ' s very smoky because of the poor ventilation . not sure what all the hype is about here . oh well - we won ' t be back . guy fieri got this one wrong or maybe they knew he was coming . if you want a great burger experience go to bobby ' s burger palace ! ( several locations in the u . s . ) 
hands down one of the best filipino restaurants i have been to . it beats ihawan , kuma inn and crystal ' s . romantic ambience , delicious food and cocktails that leave you wanting more ! loved the sisik , lumpia , kare-kare , crispy pata , lechon kawali , and lamb adobo . 
i walked into this place not expecting much . this guy dan greeted me as soon as i walked in and helped me understand the menu . they use some sort of airplane theme for their food names . anyways he was awesome , helped me out and recommended to me flavors to try . the wait is something to get used to but honestly , worth it . food was great and he really knew what he was talking about . was a great experience overall . 
excellent wings ! the sauce on the wings reminds me of wings i used to eat upstate , though sometimes i wish the wings were a bit crispier . either way , best wings in the city . burgers are great here too ! 
i decided to write this review today because i saw a groupon for this spot today and i wanted to warn would-be customers . this place sucks big time , i am usually a big supporter of locally-owned business but if you offer horrible customer service and horrible food then you just can not have my vote . i drove by this place one day when i was lost and made a mental note to check it out the following weekend . so right after work on a friday i went in to place my order for ribs , chicken , rice and veggies . the owner and cashier didn ' t bother to greet me , they just stared at me until i said hello and asked if i could place an order . there was only one other customer in the place so i figured i ' d get my order in no time . wrong ! i waited an hour for my order to be filled . meanwhile , everyone else that came in received the same order i had placed in no time . when i asked the rude cashier when i could expect my order , she just snapped at me and said it was coming . maybe she didn ' t realize that i spoke spanish and the cooks were talking about how she never even gave in my order in the first place ! ! ! sadly , the owner was next to her when i ordered so he was no help either . after the hour wait , the owner kept apologizing as i stormed out of the place pissed that i ever walked in there . once at my destination , i wish i could say the annoying wait was worth it . but i can ' t ! the veggies were soaked in grease , the rice tasteless and the meat didn ' t even taste barbecued . how the hell is that possible ? they had ovens ! i never say this , but don ' t bother going here . if you see it , run in the other direction . i wouldn ' t eat at this place again even if they were giving the food away for free . if you ' re in bloomfield , there ' s a great portugese bbq spot on broad street near bloomfield college and a new smokehouse on washington street near the bloomfield train station . those places are wayyyyyy better than this spot and not far from the location . 
great local place . always quick , friendly service , food is consistently delicious . pizza has a nice thin crispy crust . my office gets lunch at least a couple days a week , everyone loves their aniello ' s salads with grilled chicken and the bacon and chicken pizza is another favorite of ours . 
this place is much smaller than amada ( the other tapas restaurant located on chestnut street in olde city , also owned by chef jose garces ) , and so were the tables . i felt like there wasn ' t enough room to eat comfortably , even though the plates are small , lol . pretty expensive , so don ' t come too hungry or expect bang for your buck ! mainly a fun enjoyable experience to try little bites of each thing ( best to share with others ) and just linger , drink wine , have a nice time with your friends or your date . it ' s quite dark , so good for a blind date , perhaps ? the food is very good , but the service is just okay ( just like at amada ) . i think i prefer amada because it ' s more spacious , they have live flamenco , and the waiters are hot ) 
i would have appreciated knowing that zahav is a tapas style restaurant . nowhere on the menu or website does it say anything about tapas we first learned that the portions were very small after we were already seated , had ordered drinks , and selected a hummus . when we first arrived and sat down , our waiter told us that the restaurant was a ( and i quote ) " family style " restaurant in the traditional israeli fashion , where large plates of food were brought to the table and everyone shared until full . this is not the case . there is only one " family style " option on the entire menu and it costs over N per person ! the first time i went i brought my parents along and was so embarrassed when they ordered a grilled meet al ha ' esh and received three jelly bean-sized pieces of grilled duck on a bread plate - for N . the reviews before mine say things like " a regular go-to dinner spot " - this is very off base . if you go to zahav and want to be full when you leave expect to pay between N and N per person not including drinks . don ' t tell me the restaurant is family style to get me to order , then tell me i have to order at least N entrees to be full and charge me an arm and a leg . disappointing . 
finally . . . a great seafood restaurant opens in philadelphia to counter the endless stream of steakhouses in center city lately . don ' t miss the lobster roll sandwich , soft shell crabs ( when available ) and the crab cakes that rival anything we ' ve had in baltimore . i ' m not a oyster fan , but those around me that ordered them seemed quite pleased . my only complaint is those french fries ? they ' re like a pile of singed angel hair pasta pieces piled high on a plate . note to management please do us all a favor and replace the singed cappellini with real french fries ! ! with better fries this place deserves a four star rating . 
experienced junior ' s for the Nst tonight . wow ! my burger was awesome . my waiter , wayne , was exceptional . the strawberry shortcake cheesecake was decadent . i enjoyed everything . going back tomorrow . and oh , the price is right also . 
dined w the gf at little owl last weekend , very solid menu . tiny restaurant , but very cute in west village . ordered ricotta cavatelli - amazing , the bacon and beans and tomato sauce work very well meatball sliders - legit the best meatball slider i ' ve ever had , bread was perfectly crunchy , sauce was great and meatballs were cooked perfectly mexican style corn - pretty good crispy half chicken - very juicy and tasty , but too salty . the potatoes aspagus were great though . regret not going w the pork chop , it looked amazing , will get next time ! got the begignets for desert , not as soft as they should have been . . . overall , very solid and looking forward to going back . 
my absolute favorite brunch in all of new york city ! i grew up in the south and the biscuits are fantastic here . try the sandra and the nette , but to be honest , you can ' t go wrong with anything on the menu . on top of great food , the owners and staff are all really fantastic . small town feel in the middle of the big city , couldn ' t ask for more ! 
you need wait at least N minutes at lunch time , we ordered the classic and modern ramen , they taste a little bit salty , and the chicken wings are too sweet . 
manager was rude . delivery for a party came an hour late and side dishes were missing . 
color me unimpressed . i ' ve been staying at a hotel nearby and decided to try hot tomato ' s out . the first night i stopped by around N N pm ( on a tuesday ) . well , the hostess said they had just closed when i walked in . i was a bit surprised at this , she did offer to seat me anyway , but the last thing i wanted was food from a kitchen where the cooks have already started putting things away . i said that it was fine and i ' d just try another night . so i returned the following night , this time much earlier . i really enjoyed the atmosphere at hot tomato ' s . they have a cozy yet classy vibe going on . as an artist , i was really impressed by some of the decor , especially the mural painted up on the wall . with the great ambience , i really had my hopes up for hot tomato ' s , it ' s too bad they were dashed the moment i started eating my meal . i ordered the chicken parmesan , one of my favorite italian dishes . to put it bluntly , i ' ve had better leftover chicken parm that was warmed up days later . the dish i was served at ht was bland , i could hardly even taste the parmesan in it , and the spices were barely noticeable . i ' m not sure if the blandness was because they skimped on the seasonings , or just didn ' t use the freshest ingredients . either way it was very disappointing . i also prefer my chicken parm to be somewhat crispy , which mine was not . in the end , i left my plate unfinished and didn ' t care to have it packed up . now , i should probably take a step back and mention a couple good things that i did notice about the food . they do seem to have large portion sizes . my plate had plenty of food and there was no way i was going to eat all of it . if you like to eat large portions or have some to save for later then this is a plus . also , the garlic bread is very delicious , which seems to jive with several other comments here about hot tomato ' s . the positives here though are overshadowed by the negative experience i had with my food . i will likely not eat here again . if the owner of hot tomato ' s ever reads this i would suggest a simple compromise they could make to help address this less quantity for higher quality product . sure , it takes more effort and expenses to produce a higher quality product , some of those expenses can be offset by cutting portion sizes back . i think the extra effort would be more than worth it as you will find that people will always come back for spectacular food . 
i genuinely cannot believe i have not been here sooner . everything was top notch here , from the service to the coffee to the food . i came on a friday when it was slower , so i cannot speak to the wait , or service on a busy saturday or sunday morning-afternoon , but if everything was as efficient as it was when i came i can ' t imagine its bad . i had a very hard time choosing what to have for brunch as everything looked and sounded amazing . i ' m more of a savory brunch person but the famous red velvet pancakes and the cookie dough stuffed french toast did sound tempting , and looked even better . i did go with the smoked salmon eggs benedict , and was not disappointed , cooked perfectly and served with smoked salmon and herb cream cheese rolls - i cannot stop thinking about it right now . my friend got the breakfast burrito , which they can make with vegan sausage , and it was everything you could hope a breakfast burrito could be , complete with the most delicious red pepper black bean sauce . . . the portions are huge , and they make delicious iced coffees as well ( try the salted caramel ice late ) . the owner or manager i wasn ' t sure , was at the door when we were leaving , he was very nice and also made sure to offer us an iced coffee to go , a little touch that was just really nice . 
this is a great new restaurant . really cozy farm to table type of feel . i has the chicken ( which reminded me if grandma ' s farm cookin ' ! ) and the swiss chard ( delish ) . it is small and intimate and the staff is extremely attentive . our waiter answered all our questions , came over at all the right times , left us alone when we were conversing , and joked around a little bit too . overall , it was a great night and my belly left very happy . 
i love tequila , so this makes c . o . jones one of my favorite mexican restaurants . they have a great selection of high end tequila . the salsa chips are very good and i can ' t wait till their outdoor patio opens up . i enjoy the food and their margaritas are the best . it ' s comparable to la esquina which is my favorite mexican restaurant in new york city . 
by going there you are supporting a sweat shop ! employees get no breaks , no matter how many hours they work . they do not care about customers at all ! the managers say all the time one customer is not going to effect our business . also the cockroaches are something bad . customers have found them in food to their drinks . wait is super long and food is far from authentic mexican . do not even bother , save your time and go somewhere else . managers are very unprofessional . like i said before . the staff does not care about your experience only your money ! 
the food was bad , the service was worse . i won ' t be going back . 
this place is really good . the pulled pork is tender and there are many sauces to go with it . the hush puppies are great too and are made with real corn in them . made me feel like i was back home in the south . service is a plus as well . 
very good menu plus several specials . large portion sizes and many fresh seafood dishes offered . you can get your wine next store at uncorked enjoy the atmosphere great service ! the fettucine was decadent rich ! no room for dessert though . . . . some other time i hope ! 
who cares if i ' m on a diet . i ' m drunk ! was the only muddy thought running through my head as i stumbled toward artichoke , my nose leading the way . did i care there was a huge line ? time has no effect on me when i ' m inebriated , only food does . of course i ' m an overly excited idiot so i burn the roof of my mouth while attempting to take a bite from the oozing , massive piece of " pizza " . all i could taste was cream . . where is my artichoke ? my spinach ? donde estan ? ! if i ' m ordering a pizza with artichoke and spinach , i want that . not cream on crunchy bread . 
first of all . . . . omg ! ! ! ! a little bit of a back story . . . . my friend was having one of her birthday dinners here and she had asked me what i thought about the place . of course i yelped it but to me it was a turn off , but i had told her its fine . so i came into the place expecting to get maybe a small entree or a cheap appetizer , but that was not the case . there was at least nine people in our party and every single one of us got something appetizing ! my boyfriend couldn ' t stop raving about the shrimp and calamari pizza and i had the tilapia fillet . the prices i think were really cheap . for the nine of us the bill came up to N i think and some change ! he only con to me was the decor but the food really made up for it . you could see into the kitchen and not in a tasteful way plus it just looked like the pace was missing that sparkle but who cares right ! ! ! loved it . . . . going back again . . . . ooo and two more things lol N i like how they put the shrimp and calamari underneath the cheese , i think it gave it a little surprise N i dont ' know what their frying technique is but it ' s the best . the tilapia wasn ' t greasy or anything , it was really light and the skin came short of a flake but it was sooooooo good
oh man . . . the cheesesteak was amazing ! i really like that they cook up a slab of beef right when you order . freshly cooked meat is always going to be better than a bunch of chopped up beef that ' s been sitting under a heat lamp or some other abomination . 
i ate here for the first time a couple day ago , didn ' t eat in but waited inside a for my food . i would totally eat in , the ambiance is so homey and comfortable , not to mention the bollywood movies playing for whomever to take a look at . so to the food i ordered the aloo mottor gobi , they had no problem giving me channa instead of peas , and it came with rice , i wanted naan , they threw it in on the side no charge , it was no problem . the food was delicious , it tasted even better as seconds , tonight . if the food tastes good as seconds after refrigeration , its a ok to me . i recommend it to anybody looking for that authentic indian taste , that comes with warm hearty hospitality . 
i have to say , i ' m not sure i can ever have regular sushi ever again ! brilliant , colorful sushi rolled with six grain or black rice and with fresh vegetables , all come with an unusual sauce topping such as mango chili or toasted cayenne . the sushi is so flavorful you don ' t need to add soy sauce . they also have rice paper wraps - the nutty buddy wrap is amazing with a mix of veggies with peanut butter and avocado . great source of good , healthy protein . truly a great place ! i ' m glad my boyfriend found this plac
very typical ny-scene brunch place . you know that place on the corner you always walk by during prime brunch time in west village , and attractive people are seated at the patio with delicious looking food ? this is the place . so in terms of ambiance and cool factor , this place scores points . the food , on the other hand , looks better than it tastes . the basque scramble i ordered had an excessive amount of eggs with not enough sauce ingredients to balance the dish out . i ' d come here for the ambiance and not the food . 
food was stunning . service was fantastic - friendly , efficient and knowledgeable . restaurant has a slightly unique vibe- it ' s a fine dining establishment without doubt but it also has a informal super relaxed atmosphere , its really cool and hard to describe you can feel ur somewhere really special ( and pricey , sure ) but u could almost also be at ur local gastropub fav neighbourhood restaurant . it ' s not cheap but i ' d say its good value for the service , experience and food . i ' d go back in a second ! 
some of the best mexican food in nyc . take it from a california native . 
are you serious ! ? i live in new haven and i was just told that i was outside of their delivery area ! ? ! ? mind you , this is supposed to be wings over new haven ! and then when they asked the manager if they could deliver to me . . . he said it depends on how much you order ! ! ! really unprofessional ! ! i am having some friends over i was going to order about N worth of food but they just screwed that up . never again . . . . 
another max great restaurant
due to all of the favorable reviews , my friend and i expected to have an enjoyable meal here recently , but we were shocked to encounter one of our most disappointing restaurant experiences ever . we showed up on time for our reservation and were assured multiple times that our table would be ready soon . we ended up having to wait N min for that table . despite asking repeatedly for a menu to look at while we waited , we were ignored . finally , after we were seated , my friend ' s raised hand and request for bread were also ignored several times , even though waiters made eye contact with her . the attitude completely prevented us from enjoying our meal . i don ' t know if that night was just an anomaly for this restaurant , but we certainly weren ' t the only ones with a bad impression because the woman at the table next to me was also upset and frustrated . 
hip atmosphere . i recommend the fried sweet potato and squash served with a tangy vinegar sauce . although i found the green sauced coconut rice with pork ribs delicious i was disappointed because i was expecting the pork ribs to be grilled . it turned out , it ' s braised pork ribs . i told them that they should describe the pork ribs as braised as i usually associate pork ribs with grilling . i also recommend the brussel sprouts with bacon . hopefully , it didn ' t have sodium nitrite . they couldn ' t answer me if it did or not . i like this place because it ' s not the usual thai food that ' s predictable . it ' s almost too dark for me . it ' s very hard to read the menu or one ' s bill ! 
great fried plantains , fun atmosphere with great music . the salads are huge and the portions more than enough . 
woke up with a sore throat and needed some warm soothing soup . got the udon lunch special with tempura on the side ( " side of fried " as my man calls it ) . good soup . good veggie tempura . nothing crazy awesome but i also didn ' t order too adventurously due to my cold . three stars but if i go back , i ' d order something more exciting . 
clean place with some great choices in not only ramen , but also apps and sushi . the rb burger appetizer is not to be missed ! sushi was delicious , and ramen is great . the pork is very juicy . don ' t leave without trying the fried ice cream too ! 
absolutely love it . very authentic chinese food , especially spicy food . i would even go just for their " sticky rice wine sweet soup " . 
a much needed breath of fresh air to the lower east side and slightly off the trendy grid . food is great , brunch is better . don ' t forget your cash , they don ' t take credit cards . 
great sandwich ! ate twice while in town- worth it if you are in the area . 
good pizza . i have eaten at many grimaldi ' s across the country , i loved this location . it is so authentic to be where it al started . 
note editing this review to reflect the good news that la sirene now serves booze . rustic french fair served at an out of the way location . not quite sure why this place is so highly rated among the yelping community . been three times and while the food is very delicious , but in my opinion doesn ' t quite reach expectational levels . within yelp , N . N ratings are consistent with the level of food and service encountered at per se and eleven madison park . la sirene is a different animal altogether , so don ' t expect the same here that you would encounter at other N . N yelp starred dining restaurants . there is admittedly a sincerity and humility that pervades this place , and perhaps the lack of prentention contributes to the good feelings customers have for this restaurant . those who appreciate a quaint environment with nostalgic charms will find this place endearing . since it ' s an intimate restaurant with a limited number of seats , it ' s great for a date with someone special . 
i have a pretty decent amount of patience waiting for any dish and i really didn ' t mind the wait for a couple of slices here . his speed is on par with his age and it is one of the finest slices i ' ve ever had ( one pepperoni and one meatball ) . my problem is the way the orders are handled . i don ' t care if he has a preference of what he wants to make or doesn ' t want to make . if he doesn ' t want to make slices last or first or ever don ' t sell em . i ' ll buy a whole pie and let me worry about what to do with the rest . also the gal handling the orders doesn ' t seem to be very attentive to what ' s going on with orders . we placed our order and sat down with only a couple of orders ahead of us yet waited over twenty minutes and people who placed orders after us got their orders before we did . it wasn ' t till me and a friend went back to the counter to give her the stare-down that our orders got put into the queue . i really loved the pizza but as a consumer with some dignity i ' m probably not gonna go back to put up with their eccentricities or lousy service again . 
came here with clients . they picked so i will give the credit to them . i actually used to live above the restaurant when i was in college . the entire street is completely changed - it ' s a row of restaurants . they have many rooms so you can get lost easily ) . i can see it being a very romantic spot for a date . the beef tartar - came with the quail egg on top . i loved it ! ! ! perfect amount of mustard and capers . it didn ' t come with toast which was a little strange but when i asked for toasts , they arrived in no time so maybe the waiter just forgot . the quinoa scallop salad - not a big fan of the greens they have in there , a bit too bitter . they put at least N plump scallops so worth the N price tag . service was prompt - we were in and out in N . N hrs . overall a great experience so i wouldn ' t mind coming back there again for another client meeting . 
the best food in new york ! amazing ! the food tastes great , is very healthy and prices are reasonable . try the N lean ripped with lemon chicken . 
yum yum yum . a little pricey and sometimes the wait it too long . but the food is good and fairly consistent . i defnitly recommend that you make reservations before you go . but overall , i enjoyed my experience here . 
how nice service in there . my family was so happy with the server and foods . i been there many time and i always happy with that place . 
oh my goodness . when eating here for a recent date night with the boyfriend , i realized that i haven ' t reviewed this place yet . how could i have neglected this important task ? after debating for a long while where exactly we were going to go on said date night , boyfriend suggested spasso , since they never let us down before . i immediately , and happily made reservations through opentable . upon arrival , i ordered a glass of pinot grigio from our lovely waiter , who was very accommodating . boyfriend ordered a coronoa . we received a complimentary basket of bread , accompanied by a small dish of pepper-garlic deliciousness . for an appetizer , i ordered the fried calamari and boyfriend ordered the crab cake . the fried calamari was fine -- it didn ' t have a whole lot of flavor . most of the flavor came from the tomato sauce . the crab cake was also fairly bland -- just a standard crab cake . i ' m never a fan of the filling that comes in crab cakes i ' d rather just a ball of crab meat , honestly , so i may be biased . i love me an italian place that makes their own pasta . there ' s something in the chewy , homemade dough that just makes me unbearably happy . right after ordering a glass of rose , i ordered their spinach pasta ravioli with a four-cheese and wild mushroom filling . it normally is served with an alfredo sauce , but i got them with their tomato sauce ( i could drink the tomato sauce on its own , it ' s so delicious ) . the ravioli were perfectly cooked with just enough filling . the filling was also delicious . no complaints there ! boyfriend ordered the crab ravioli , which is served with a cream sauce . i snuck a taste , and i thought they were very good , with a nice crab flavor . definitely liked my ravioli better though . we ended the meal by sharing tiramisu , which is absolutely delicious ! highly recommend it . i can ' t wait to come back here again , for more chewy homemade pasta deliciousness . 
after a long day touring the island we walked down to korzo for a fine meal plus a great beer . i have had great meals in nyc and i follow my sons guidance to never eat at a franchise . well krozo ' s is one i ' ll recommend to anyone coming to brooklyn . 
this is a tourist and late night must-do in nyc . hands down . recommend the lamb over the chicken . 
this place is my go to when i want ramen . 
this place has really fantastic ramen and the service is great . the noodle bowls are big , packed with delicious things , and are rich and full of flavor . i ' ve eaten there twice so far and it will soon be many more times ! it ' s really just a great place to grab a bite . i ' ve read a review complaining about " authenticity " which i can ' t understand . if food is delicious , why complain about authenticity ? it ' s about as authentic a bowl of ramen as i ' ve ever had but who cares ? it was amazing . 
pizzas are great , but the tiramisu is to die for . i would go back just for dessert . ambience is nice quiet and dark ( good for coffee dates and mellow evenings ) . garden area is very cool and great for larger parties . 
i go to the devil ' s den at least once a week . beer selection is constantly evolving . so it ' s a great place to try something new . they change their food menu pretty regularly so check back often . i ' ve never been disappointed . their farmhouse burger ( dry rubbed beef , pulled pork , fried egg ) was incredible . i couldn ' t put it down til there was nothing left but grease on my fingers . their mussels rival monks and eulogy and " the den " has a better layout floor plan in my opinion . happy hour they have N N price oysters on the half shell , something i usually take advantage of . they ' re a little pricey , but fair . you ' re getting top notch food and incredible beer so you definitely get what you pay for . bar staff is awesome . most of them know my name , i haven ' t done anything exceptional ( that i know of ) , they ' re just good people who are good with faces . i ' ll continue to be a regular for as long as they ' ll have me . 
this is only worth it if you are really craving chinese noodle soup but in my opinion the food is too greasy , oily and the right flavor is just not there . i usually only come here if i am desperate for a beef noodle soup or my friends want to come here . i usually don ' t even really enjoy it . i am always at a constant crave for good chinese food but its rare to come by in philadelphia but this is only because i grew up in taiwan so my standards for beef noodles soup is extremely high . 
a great place for friends to come to . good food , good , fun atmosphere . i love coming here some nights after work with a couple friends to get dinner and a couple drinks . 
i was lucky enough to be there before it ' s crowded . well , to be exact , my friend who lives a couple blocks away took a table for me before i came in . pumpkin lovers , their pancake is great . 
great burgers if your willing to wait for them late night . best to head there during the day for a more relaxed atmosphere . 
this is my favorite steak in brooklyn . i would take a meal here over peter lugers any day . get here early or be prepared to wait a couple hours , but with the movie theater on grand just a few blocks away it wouldn ' t hurt to put your name down , see a movie , and return for a fantastic dinner . my favorites include the axe handle rib eye for two , long beans , and bib salad . also the octopus is exceptional . service is mediocre but that doesn ' t effect the overall satisfaction the food provides . 
N for a complete , delicious lunch ! very good service and pleasant atmosphere ! i was there for lunch on a sunday and really want to come back ! the location is just a few steps from the green and yale , the service is quick and very polite , the food absolutely gorgeous ! 
joju hit ' s the spot for lunch . the N , the pork belly b nh m was delicious . of the sandwich , only one bite tasted a little too fatty , but otherwise perfect . 
some of the best food i ' ve had . . . period . we walked in at N N on tuesday night and didn ' t have to wait at all . the market salad was perfectly balanced the tiramisu was good , but i wouldn ' t order it again the duck with walnut crust and cherries was heavenly . the flavors were delicate and well balanced and everything was cooked to perfection . if paying cash and waiting for a table isn ' t your cup of tea . . . feel free to go somewhere else . i found the food , the service , and the experience delightful . fyi - they do take reservations from N-N N
after reading all the positive reviews , i was really excited to try this place . having lived in midtown west area for the past N years , i would always trek down to astor place ( yakitori taisho ) when i needed a yakitori fix . so when i read about this place , i was really excited because it was so close . we ended up there on friday night , around Npm . was told the wait was an hour . we put our name on the list and wandered off . we weren ' t seated till maybe N hour N mins . we ordered several of the daily specials ( kobe beef skewer , sweet potato tempura ) , skewers ( pork , chicken meatball ) , this sashimi dish and stir fried udon . what a disappointment - especially on a hungry stomach ! the food was mediocre at best . certainly not worth the wait ( or the hype ) . we noticed the majority of people inside were early Ns . . . . if you want yakitori , do not go here . the skewers at yakitori taisho are infinitely better . other dishes , all mediocre , no wow factor . this place may have been featured on a show , but it is seriously over-hyped and you can get much better food downtown . on positive note , service was good and overall atmosphere was lively , even close to midnight . and though food was mediocre , it still beats some of the crap in times square . . . so if it was really late at night and we just needed a place for a late night snack and some sake , i would recommend this place . if you have more time , make a trip downtown . 
from the outside , the quaker diner looks like a quaint little place with tons of character . from the inside , you see that it ' s a typical old diner with tons of dusty , dirty character . we walked in the front door , and a waitress asked us to go stand by the " other " front door to wait for a table . a few others piled into the packed diner and ended up in front of us . maybe i wasn ' t aware of how the whole " first come , first serve " idea works . we were eventually seated in a booth toward the back of the diner . i noticed all the antique items all over the place , but also noticed that apparently none of them had been dusted since they were new . i ' m all for having character , but that ' s simply a health concern in my opinion . the food was very typical for a diner . bland simple stuff that ' s east to crank out . i got one of the specials , the feta and spinach omelette . at first glance , it looked pretty promising . upon a closer inspection , i noticed that there was a rather long hair protruding from the end of the dish . had it been only on the plate , i probably would ' ve brushed it off and ignored it . unfortunately , this particular hair was cooked into the omelette to the point that i was able to turn my breakfast into a string puppet . it was promptly sent back to the kitchen . the service was a bit spotty . our server wasn ' t too attentive , as she didn ' t notice my dish go back to the kitchen until the re-cooked dish was about to arrive . i ' m completely in favor of letting your customers eat without bothering them , but you should at least check up on them from time to time . i attempted to pay for the meal ( including the hair dish ) , but after waiting by the register for N minutes i was informed that they only take cash or personal check . great . all in all , it was a less than mediocre experience . although i ' m in walking distance to this location , i ' ll avoid it in the future . 
best italian experience to date ! ! right when we walked in the door we were graciously greeted by all the staff . the restaurant was super cozy and felt like i was transformed to italy . our server was very knowledgable and explained anything we asked about the menu to a t . we started with the grilled octopus . the sauce on it was so unique and tasty . then came the meatballs . . . best meatballs i ' ve had ! since they get their meat from pino ' s , you know it ' s organic and fresh . they were so moist and delicious . i ordered the vegetable lasagna as it was recommended to try by our server . this was probably the freshest , best tasting ( to my standards ) lasagna i ' ve had . this place is a must try and i ' ll definitely be back after the wonderful experience i had ! 
everything about this place screamed problems . the service was horrible and they were completely unaccommodating . moreover , the hostess was incredibly rude . the food was mediocre ( and thats being generous ) and the price point was very high . 
the manager or whom ever the heck he thinks he is , mr . martin is very rude , unprofessional and needs to get the heck out of there . i will never go there again and will tell everyone i know the same . he needs to take some lessons in customer service . ! ! ! ! 
great fries . definitely coming back
food was ok , but definitely not worth the wait . chicken was way too sweet , catfish was nothing to write home about , cornbread was dry , and mac n cheese was tasty but really greasy . collard greens were quote good . crazy long wait ! ! ! not worth the wait or the high cost . 
i only came here for lunch , i haven ' t been to dinner here yet , but from the long lines i see outside sometimes for dinner , i am not really that motivated to go . however , the food is really top notch here , i had the grape leaves and calamari to as an appetizer and filled up the rest with drinks . the food was filled with a variety of flavor . i ' d definitely go back for lunch again . the prices are more reasonable during lunch of course . 
the artichoke pizza tastes like artichoke spinach dip . . . not a bad thing , a little crushed red pepper and we ' re good to go . for N a slice , it ' s a good portion and convenient for late night eats in the east village . don ' t come here expecting the best slice of ny pizza . 
went to enjoy the downstairs music . not bad , decent dj . great dance and Ns mix . would go back
i was born within N feet of hoagie haven ' s door . that may add no credibility to what i am about to say , but please understand that this part of the world is close to my heart . i will try to keep this short . i was a very loyal hoagie haven customer until george ' s opened up N doors down . simply put , i think that george ' s has better food and better ambiance . hoagie haven ' s food is still good , but doesn ' t compare with george ' s . additionally , haven sometimes feels like a tourist trap ( avoid it at all cost during reunions ) . haven is still a great establishment and i hope it never goes away , but for my money , george ' s the better spot . 
my collegues and me always have the drunken noodle there . sometimes , we go for N chilis ( hot spicy ) . best in new haven . 
the worst place to eat ever with lovely friends and family . i went to the restaurant when i visited for my kid ' s princeton univ . football day camp on thursday , june Nth , N . we are living in maryland , the trip for us was very pleasant and enjoyable before visiting there . first of all , the price ! ! ! . ramen , the lowest price noodle menu at usual restaurant was Ns and regular bibipbob was N . furthermore , we can not eat side dishes like kimchi without extra charge . i remember N . even more , they charged miso soup for about N , which we can enjoy free or more less at usual chinese or other asian restaurants . and also , don ' t forget following advice when you go there . very important ! ! ! " never complain about the taste or eating atmosphere . never . you will be hit by angry and ill-tempered owner . " while my family was eating , the owner ( a sushi man with black hat at the center ) and a employee was talking too loud for so long and i ask them to be quiet for comfortable eating with my family . can you imagine what happened next ? he ran into near my family table with very upset face and said " you have no right to say and to request such a thing . this is my place i own , bastard ! ! " . he doesn ' t stop cursing abusing us and we had to call the police . the worst restaurant experience in korea and us . for decades . 
i would definitely recommend this restaurant . we went there for the first time last week and loved it . the food isn ' t just great , it ' s absolutely delicious ! i had the ravioli and it was so fresh and light it was almost like crepes . the atmosphere is also very cool and comfy and the staff owners were so friendly ! 
this place is amazing , we have been coming here for years and this place never dissapoints . everything on their menue is delicious and the service is great , doesn ' t hurt that it ' s byob also ) one thing to note is they are cash only so make sure u are prepared . 
awesome Nam meal right across the road from the hotel . chicken with rise N ! the hot sauce is a lil too hot for me , beware xxxx
yum , the pork banh mi sandwiches are great . the portions are so generous that usually i can eat half for lunch and save half for dinner . and , on top of that , for N . N a sandwich it doesn ' t break the bank . it might seem like chaos when you first arrive , due to the cult following , but alas you ' ll soon figure it all out as their english isn ' t that bad . just be wary of the grannies or other cantonese speaking people who will more than likely try to cut you in line . oh and they relocated , but i can ' t remember where . 
i love places that grant you the luxury of being able to never have the same dish twice and keep experimenting . sripraphai ' s menu is incredibly diverse and is constantly supplemented with ever-changing specials . in other words , you won ' t get bored of it . naturally , it ' s also due to the fact that their food is delicious . i ' ve lived in the neighbourhood long enough to see it grow from a tiny joint to a medium-sized one , and finally into a large venue . unfortunately , the crowd kept growing proportionally . expect long wait times on the weekend , unless you go during off-peak hours . as i said , their menu is very diverse , and i tend to diversify , but there are some dishes that i ' ll always go and revisit , such as the classic papaya salad , the crispy watercress salad , the drunken noodles , the kao-soy curry noodles and the fried fish with red curry and thai eggplants amongst others . but even such simple classics as red and green curries are awesome too . keep in mind that their food can get quite spicy . i personally ask them to make it violently ( literally ) spicy and still find it not spicy enough . but that ' s because i crave these fiery anal bleedings you get the next day . some friends still find it spicy after asking them to make the dish mildly spicy . wusses . they are no longer my friends anyway . their thai iced tea rocks and works pretty well as a means to calm the burning sensations . the service is usually good and friendly . needless to say , it suffers a bit when the place gets overcrowded . the food ' s been consistently good ( with a single exception , but as they say , " l ' exception confirme la regle " ) and all the dishes that i ' ve tried were delicious . make sure to stop by their sweets fridge on your way out . their sticky rice and coconut milk is awesome . their white coconut jello thingy is great too , but skip the green ' n ' white one . and if you can overcome the fact that yes , it is fried onion on top of that sweet , cake-like thing , then you ' ll be rewarded with one of the nicest desserts ever . and if you happen to find the line too long or land there on a wednesday ( their closing day ) inadvertently , just hop on the N trains and head to arunee thai cuisine , a couple of stops away , for some equally awesome thai food . 
on yelp i ' m a liberal five star giver . however , egans or " oddfellows " as i affectionately have dubbed it , deserves all five of those beautiful little buggers . i have not once eaten from here and left disappointed . such great variety on the menu ! so what did our party enjoy on the eve of the new year ? well , i had a couple red ales and an irish car bomb ( with must with dinner ) to drink . oysters , buffalo wings , all good . split the cottage pie ( like shepherds pie but with beef ) with my fianc , and it was delicious . the fact that i couldn ' t finish the cottage pie because of all the drinks and other stuff was my one regret . all in all , a great spot for a nice quiet dinner ( super noisy and can be crowded at the bar ) if you can secure a table . i will be coming back soon for a joint birthday party in march because i don ' t get to eat irish food often enough throughout the year , and i love to eat irish food . nom nom nom . outdoor patio area during summer months , otherwise a fair amount of standing room or , again , try to secure a table or the one table room with a fireplace . if you ' ve been here before you know what i ' m talking about . 
chicken and rice ! ! ! i saved my Nth review for the greatest thing you could eat ! i ' ve been to new york N times in the last N years and eaten really expensive meals but halal is still the best meal i have ever had . i have been here over N times . i ' ve waited in line in snow and rain for this and i hate lines ! i know they have multiple locations but i only come to the original Nrd and Nth location that opens at Npm every day . always my first stop when i land . when coming , prepare to wait in line ! this is a great meal hungry , drunk , or as cold leftovers hangover . whenever i get recommendations to eat in other states , i always ask what your Nrd and Nth equivalent is . on to the food ! chicken and lamb with rice - N - i like the combo meats to add dfifferent flavors . i had each by themselves but perfer the combo . it comes with salad , pita bread , white and red sauce . it is mindboggling how something so simple can be so epic . when you break it down , it ' s just ground lamb and chopped chicken over seasoned rice with pita bread and salad . the chicken and lamb is not seasoned crazy , rice is rice , salad is chopped up iceberg , the pita is packaged , and everything is precooked and kept warm on the cart . then there are the sauces . the white sauce is creamy yummy crack goodness ! i know it is crazy , but i call it the greatest ranch dressing ever created ( even though i know it is not ranch ) . and the red sauce , hell in your mouth ! it provides such good butt burning heat . but when you combine both sauces with everything else , it turns into the greatest thing on earth . heaven in a to go container ! i also tried the gyro verison which was awesome if you want the same dish in a hand held form . honestly the greatest N food investment you will make ! i wish la had something epic like this . i will be back ! ! ! 
i came in for a quick lunch and thought the food wasn ' t too bad ( or too spectacular , the veggie meat was pretty soggy and slimy ) i only ate it because i was starving . i was waiting for my sandwich and saw a roach scuttling under tables . i mean , it ' s nyc , i get it . but still . also , the air was very hot , stuffy and meaty ( i don ' t know how the chef suffers back there ) . while it was just a regular eating joint , it didn ' t really look like a restaurant . it looks like it was maybe an office before or something . yeah , i won ' t be stopping by again . i ' ll go expand my bahn mis horizons elsewhere . 
went for taste of hartford last night and was very impressed ! the food was great for both a sushi lover and a non-eater of sushi . the service could not possibly have been faster . it is quite energetically loud in there because of all the hard surfaces , so be ready for that , but toh was a big success for us . 
does anyone know if these tortillas have gluten in them ? i know corn tortillas sometimes have flour or some form of gluten as an additive . i miss fresh corn tortillas so much , and am thrilled philly finally has a tortilleria ! but i also really don ' t want to get sick . thanks . 
four and a half stars ! no one is perfect . i wish we could give N N stars . i like balthazar . . . alot . no trip to nyc is complete without a trip to balthazar . i ' ve only been for dinner and it ' s always been a fab experience . first off , i just love the space . it ' s like you walk off the street in soho , cross over the threshold of balthazar into paris . how do they do that ? always crowded and loud and delicious ! my faves are the unbeatable onion soup grantinee , the best i ' ve ever had . the duck shephard ' s pie is amazing and oh so rich . steak frites -- ' nuff said . the salads are fresh and tasty , the raw bar is one of the best in the city and then there ' s the desserts . oh the sweet lovliness of creme brulee , profiteroles and the pineapple upside down cake . balthazar , i swoon for you . 
went on the weekend for lunch , very loud and over N min . wait time . the food was tasty but the noodle soups were overpriced for what you get . the appetizers were better than the noodle soup . i never read in any of the reviews that you might have to share a table with other customers , not great if you are sitting at a long rectangular table , with strangers so close across from you . . . awkward while waiting for your food and not suitable for personal conversation . we did learn from another customer that you can request additional noodles for free if you still have extra soup left from your bowl of noodle soup . service was attentive , however , our waiter seemed to have acquired an attitude after he saw my husband try a little of the extra noodles ( free ) that i had ordered to finish my soup since my husband had ordered a different kind of noodle soup , i thought he might like to try a bite of my noodles initially before i finished them up . . . what ' s the big deal ? ! the waiter definitely pist me off . 
-bacon needs to be cut thicker ( for grilled cheese with thick cheese tomato and a place called swine we expected bacon ) -potato wedges need texture ( crispy ) -duck terrine needs seasoning and some of the bread was pretty burned -short ribs weren ' t matching the description ( tasted no fruitiness ) -jalape o cucumber cocktail wasn ' t too flavorful N drink we expected much more ( looked forward to the jalape o ! ) 
i have only come here twice for lunch outside , but never actually went to the bar area except for passing by . city tap house is the kind of place which , in my opinion , does everything right except for providing consistently good food . the atmosphere is rather nice - i like the outside area and how it is designed , and the service is pleasant and swift . but oh the food , this is where i cannot make up my mind . they have a good selection of beers but a horrible selection of wines . ( i don ' t blame them for that , they are supposed to be a beer place after all . ) the bass i got tasted very good , but the sides coming with it were over-salted to the point that i left most of it on my plate . some of their appetizers are good ( bruschetta , empanadas ) , some of them are ok ( the mediterranean plate is a bit bland ) and some are fantastic . i am a huge fan of their sweet potato fries and it ' s the only aspect of the establishment which puts them into the N stars category . in many aspects you can do much worse when choosing a bar , but its priciness is reason enough for me to never come here unless somebody else is paying . 
our party of N arrived at bouley for a late dinner - starting at Npm . to be sure , we were all hungry by then , so it was good that service was relatively fast , unlike many of bouley ' s counterparts . our table took on the N-course tasting challenge , of course ! since the menu is not available online , and i was quite tired by then , i ' ll use this review to give a general gist of what ' s to come if you go there since i can ' t remember the names of everything i got . i walked into bouley thinking that i would not be impressed as i ' m not typically a fan of french dinner food , but was i wrong . from the appetizer to the dessert , everything came out fresh , hot , and tasty . as with most french food , it was rich - but since portion sizes are not controlled by mcdonald ' s - everything came out in just the right amounts . one item that i do remember was the valrhona chocolate souffle - every bite was as bittersweet and rich as the last - and it was by far one of my favorite desserts i ' ve had in a while . to complement the dishes , bouley also has a great selection of artisan breads - from apricots , walnuts , pistachios , to plain old sourdough . i ' d recommend the apricots and pistachios - two of my faves . we would have tried the cheese selection had it not been Nam by the time we finished with dessert ! 
first timer . i am a believer . white clam pie . tons of garlic , oil , chewy tasty clams . amazing thing crust , crispy chewy . going to make sure i come back here someday soon . 
from chef point , this place is a great challenge for the owner to try somthing new , it is great to interduce us to sushi conveyor , i went there last week . , place was mid busy , host wellcome me min i walked in , take me to the sushi bar , chef was so friendly explain me how i make my order , i try tuna roll first . it was fresh enough for me to order more , then i got rainbow roll was totally super fresh , i had N sake to drink , my bill was N , i am really glad to see this place and see how hard they try to please the custmer
i feel so stupid for waiting to get a table for over one hour ! ! ! one thing is if you are waiting to have a fabulous dinner but that was not the case at all ! food very average , staff arrogant and rude service , very pricey for no quality at all ! i was expecting so much more then what it was , i have one word for this place being so busy marketing ! honestly that ' s the only reasonable explanation to me . as a food lover i was very disappointed . 
miso ramen was the only thing i tried and it was definitely yummy ! have to go back soon ) 
got a groupon ( or was it living social ? ) for this place and thought i ' d give it a try . the food was overall bland and uninteresting . it struck me as the type of place that might want to please people who may not really like indian food . any flavor was overpowered by salt in both of our dishes , both vegetarian . we ordered N appetizers , they completely forgot to bring one , and the samosas were average at best . they also brought me the wrong main course . they offered to make the correct dish , but i didn ' t want to wait while my friend ate their meal , it was still a vegetarian dish so i just settled for it . the decor is over the top for the lack of quality food . there are many authentic indian restaurants in the area that are much much better . 
no other words can explain this place other than , " the best sushi joint in philadelphia " ! i ' ve been coming here since it opened ( i even have my own name of " fire guy " in there due to a funny story ) and have received the same outstanding service and delicious food throughout the years . everything from the appetizers to the dinners and then the desserts are phenomenal . add to the fact that it ' s a byob and that makes it as perfect as a restaurant as you can find . i highly recommend the triple spicy crunch tuna roll , the tuna club roll , the chloe as well as the strawberries as dessert . i ' ve also had their bibimbap as well as ramen and both were exceptional . although i ' ve now moved out of philly , i will N be coming back to doma as it ' s not only the best sushi joint but one of the best restaurants in the area . 
great style mexican place . . . and reasonably priced . chips were crispy , salsa fresh , food tasted good . we had N people dinner under N , so i consider that a good deal . would go back for lunch , dinner or even happy hour- they have a whole page of delicious-looking drinks to choose from ! 
just tried their tiramisu ( N a square ) and just found my new dessert go to spot ! yum ! 
love this market great food vendors love the donuts there best ever from the mennonites from lancaster county rocks , the new orleans restraunt rocks too love this place clean too
best pizza in nyc . amazing bloody mary . plaid . mason jars . cheese . beer . what else are you looking for ? 
i absolutely love almost everything about this place . the incredible beer selection , the local food and the outdoor seating . i go here a lot and i enjoy it every time . the only issues i have with this place as a customer is the random grumpy wait person and the fact that craft beer is marked up N from retail prices . i understand this is the norm with craft beer at places like this but i really wish this place would break that trend . it won ' t effect my visits but i have to observe it here . 
we ' ve been going to misconduct for years . the place is a great spot to watch any sporting event . so many tvs . that ' s why we keep going back . food is average , and has gotten a bit expensive . beer list is a bit odd , no standard options on the list , and the stuff they have isn ' t always the best quality . a few tweaks and this place could be a five star sports bar . 
i am not a fan of chain franchises , but after eating at pio pio , i can see how they are in demand ! we went there for dinner after an event on pier N . at first , it looked like we are going to eat in a tight space by the bar , but as we went farther inside , we unexpectedly saw this large dining area with high ceiling and the walls covered with wood branches . the soft lighting makes it suitable for a date , yet the open space makes it suitable for a group dinner . regardless of the decor , i would come here just for the food . we shared the mixto cebiche . all the seafood tasted fresh and was nicely seasoned . the lomo saltado has to be one of the best that i have ever tasted . not only was the beef juicy and tender , but everything else from the sauce to the fries worked well together . my friends got the classic chicken pio , and they liked it as well . the " mangorita " was a nice companion to my meal . let ' s hope it stays local and doesn ' t aim to become like tgifridays . 
since pho saigon has become my favorite , go to pho place since my last review , i thought it was time for an update ! the service here is still really casual , and even a bit rushed during peak hours ( think sunday afternoons ) , but they are generally helpful and attentive . they always return right away with extra limes when i ask for them . i just dislike it when a waiter hands me a steaming bowl of pho from across the table , instead of walking around to set it in front of me . ( i start crying when the water i wash my dishes with gets a little too hot , so i don ' t think i ' d be able to handle a hot , heavy bowl of soup ) . their pho is glorious . compared to every other pho place that i ' ve ever been to , pho saigon is the most consistent . not once have i ever disliked the quality of the noodles , the meat , or the broth . for this , i will come back again and again . 
if you haven ' t been here before . . . what the hell are you waiting for ! ! ! ! i ' ve ordered from here at least a thousand times , especially for those late night snacks . ( they are open N hours ! ) i could name my favorite empanadas but it would probably just be the whole list . even the breakfast empanadas are amazing ! the guacamole chips appetizer is great with fresh jalepenos on top and homemade plantain chips . the prices are affordable . seating is limited , as it is a really small place but totally worth the wait . 
oftentimes reviewers are on target . not this time i regret not reading yelp ( i stopped at google ) . i have dined in whole-in-the-walls the food was great ! the wood pit is the pits . i thought i was going to break my jaw on that burnt quasi tough ribs the collard greens along with the mac cheese were bland . i was afraid to try the chicken ( it may have jumped up ran ) . no , i do not recommend ! i went to teranga in bloomfield ( across from ihop ) about couple of times within the past year . the food ( not southern bbq ) is edible more affordable . 
i went to this restaurant at the behest of one of my friends who raved about it . i personally think the place is overrated . it ' s extremely crowded and they don ' t take reservations , so good luck getting a table ( especially if you ' re with a larger group ) . we waited almost an hour and a half for ours . granted , i wasn ' t in a particularly good mood the night i went to this restaurant , and didn ' t appreciate the long wait , so you could add an extra star to this review if you wanted . nonetheless , the food was good ( though not nearly as great as my friend had made it out to be ) and staff friendly -- though very often too busy tending to the swarm of other customers there to fully tend to you . 
first of all , i am a great big fan of thai chinese food . . . veg varieties only second , i don ' t write reviews that often . my reason to write a " long " review is explained below . we wanted to take our friend for dinner as it was his birthday . he wished to eat thai food and hence , we showed up around N N on a sunday night . we ' re N adults N kid . the very front of the restaurant made me think twice before i entered , esp with a kid . the garbage bin in front of the restaurant was soooooo full . i even took a pic of it to show it to their manager and ask him to do something about it . well , i didn ' t do that , coz the manager was nowhere to be seen . the quality of service and knowledge of food the waiters had was very very poor . the male waiter who took our orders failed to explain about the food . go to pf chang or somewhere , they will explain to their customers about the food and its major ingredients ( veg or non-veg ) . this waiter did not bother to do so . he took the order and left . there was a lot of noise in the restaurant . i guess , it came from the kitchen or the restaurant was really that big so as to accommodate a huge party . anyway , it was annoying . the food finally came . we ordered pineapple fried rice ( spice level-mild ) among others . honestly , appetizer green tea were good . the fried rice had non-veg in it . this dish , we ordered for the kid . there was shrimp and other non-veg . we wanted them to take it away and re-prepare the same dish but without the non-veg . well , that was denied right away by the waiter . added to our misery , the fried rice was very spicy . too spicy for the kid and he refused to eat it . they failed to provide additional napkins plates . we had to take it from the table nearest to us . no one bothered to ask us how the food was ! ! ! finally , we decided to leave and we did . we called the waiter and asked for the check . he did not bother to ask why we ' re leaving without ordering any entrees . they even charged us gratuity . we left paying them for their ill-service and not-to-the-expectation food , leaving the kid hungry . we went to another restaurant to feed the kid some good food . i will never go to rhong tiam again , nor take any of our friends to this place . 
the food is simple and has good flavors . the staff is friendly and polite . often though , you can see the mother of this lebanese-french cafe getting stressed out and yelling to the rest of the staff . the decor is clean and elegant and i do enjoy the cozy atmosphere it provides . the food is great and there is a great ambiance . skip honey ' s and try this out next door . 
the place is small and it gets really packed . its clean- funky lay back ambiance . inexpensive place to catch up with friends family over hearty arepas and delicious natural juices . we ordered different types of arepas and they were all delicious . you will get full with one arepa-then again am nine months prego-and one arepa felt like five in my stomach ) . def recommend this place for its food and service . 
i am in love with artichoke . the artichoke pizza is amazing not only because it ' s unique but it ' s also a hefty slice . when it ' s fresh and hot right out of the oven it tastes the best ( like how i ' d prefer any slice of pizza ) . it ' s also a great after a night out just to satisfy that greasy appetite . the margherita slice is also tasty and cheaper but not as thick as the artichoke slice . prices are high ( for pizza slices ) unfortunately and there are long lines at night . however , the slices are large ! ! also , i wish there could be more seating , especially covered seating during the winter . 
i was pleased . after watching spider man turn off the dark i was looking for something to eat other than shake shack ( again ) and i think yelp suggested room service . so i schlepped up Nth avenue . i ordered a pad thai because i ' m not really adventurous . there was a note on the menu that the thai don ' t really do pad thai with chicken , they would order pad thai with shrimp so i ordered pad thai with shrimp to be more authentic and not the super special pad thai on the menu . this was days ago so i don ' t realllllly remember but i do think i enjoyed it . and it looks like hundreds of people have also enjoyed it too . pretty sure the bar had a bunch of purse hooks . 
this is one of the best jamaican places here in hartford ! none of the other places make their food spicy enough for me without adding anything extra . this place cooks with just enough spices and i love it ! if i also want it spicier , they give me jalapenos and more peppers . great portions for decent prices . the staff is also wicked sweet and nice . i ' ve been here two times already and i ' m hooked ! 
if i crave chicken , this is where i go . the green house sauce that they provide makes all their food extra tastier . i get the combo to share with two to three people . instead of getting the regular plantanes , we got the unfried sweetened plantanes and it was just the kind i ate in peru ! be careful ! i always leave with many papercuts on both of my hands due to their butcher paper table cloth . . . it may be just me since my friends don ' t seem to have this problem . their seviche is excellent too . ooo and their seafood paella - ( i ' m sure it ' s called something else ) but that plate is hefty and large for two people to indulge in . 
i came here twice in the last week . once for dinner and again for brunch . sat inside for dinner and than sat outside for brunch . for dinner , i wasn ' t too impressed . first off the food was good . i ordered the chicken breast , which was cooked well but i wasn ' t blown away . the decor confused me in all honesty . it is supposed to be a cafe but had more of a tavern feel , because of the low lighting . N N for dinner this spot is definitely more of a brunch location . i ordered the benedict brioche and it was tremendous . it was probably the best thing i have ever eaten for brunch . the only reason the experience did not deserve a N N is because the service can be better . sitting outside , the waitress barely visited us and just felt eager to get rid of us . N N
pros - super cool ambiance - great sushi - awesome sushi chefs cons - ish ain ' t cheap made reservations and came here for dinner on a weeknight . opted for the omakase and ate until we were over-stuffed ( protip tell them when you ' re done . they will literally keep going until you tell them to " stop " ) . it was a great assortment of different types of sushi and they often gave you different styles of the same fish . service is included in the price , which is kind of nice . the sushi chef didn ' t ask us how much we wanted to spend but i think you can opt for that if you want . it was really fun grabbing the sushi with our hands . 
very nice american spot for food . . . the mac and cheese is the best and the burgers are good as well
they make awesome chicken and rice . they give you a choice of yellow or basmatti rice . i always order the latter . they always give you a falafel ball while you wait if there is a big line . i didn ' t think the falafel was that great but the chicken is delicious . the guys are always friendly and i ' m glad i work only N block away from this gem . 
ate at kelly ' s last night after a yale hockey game . it was our first time there . the atmosphere is very nice-a very comfortable place . the food was very good . i had the onion soup and a cobb salad . both were excellent--big portions . i would go back again . 
love this spot ! i ' m a regular at catas for their nightlife and it ' s always a good time . its never the same dj so that always makes things interesting . the bar has a good variety of alcohol and the bartenders are pretty attentive . 
absolutely wonderful cheesecake . we decided to stop here after we saw a wednesday matinee for a delicious dessert . i highly recommend the cheesecake with fresh strawberries . this is a very cute restaraunt with a diner look and feel . we had to wait less than N minutes for a table , which wasn ' t bad for how crowded the restaraunt was when we were there . i would absolutely go visit back . 
this is a good place to visit , even if a bit busy . decor ambiance- N N -the interior is surprisingly very large and spacious for a restaurant located on a block teeming with other businesses . also the lighting was good and added to the dining experience . service N N - we waited for about N minutes on a sunday evening . but this is expected for a decent restaurant in k town around that time . also the appetizers arrived rapidly and our water was refilled on a regular basis . food N N - bcd provides a lot of ban chan , and as everyone can attest to here , the fish is especially delicious . as for bcd ' s specialty ( tofu ) , it was overall better than average . our party ordered the mushroom tofu soup , the kimchi tofu soup , and the stone pot bibimbap . all were as spicy as we selected and hot as well . i especially enjoyed the hot stone bibimbap with
my husband and i stopped in today for the first time , and the food was wonderful ! he has the steak and plantains , and i had tilapia and friend green plantains ! since my dad has just been in the same day , he offered us dinner size meals for lunch , and threw in a free piece of tres leches ! we also ordered a piece of flan which was delicious and tasted homemade ! the owner , josh went out of his way to make sure our first experience was perfect , and it was ! we are very excited to have such a great little restaurant in our neighborhood ! we will definitely be going back ! 
another small pseudo italian ( but honestly cute ) restaurant from the owner of " aria " . this time the result is mediocre at best . we went tonite and the service was non existing . the hostess was completely clueless and helpless . . . . all she kept saying to us was " i don ' t know . . . . . let me ask someone else " . if you are that clueless don ' t wait tables ! and the food was nothing to write home about . . . . i had better taglioli with clams in my school cafeteria in italy ( yes , i am from italy ) . but the shock came with the check when we realized that a glass of sparking wine ( not french champagne ) is N , a bottle of pellegrino is N and the cicchetti of the day ( usually N ) are priced at N . for some " mysterious " reason all these prices were missing from the menu . now we know why ! would we go back ? not ! 
great service , good sushi . 
the one star is not for the cake but for the insensitive N number people who work for them . ordered a cake for someone ' s birthday with a message . cake arrived the day before the party and no message with it . i was told to put it in the refrigerator for the next day and sometimes they deliver early . . . no message so the birthday surprise was asking and calling everyone to find out who sent it . it was a mess for the party a day old cake without the card and the surprise was ruined . . . thanks jr . invoice number for the order was N they can look it up and know who wrote this . should stick with pro flowers , or sherri never had a problem with them . 
i just drove by this place , the architecture is absolutely amazing . the stone that they choose is beautiful , it looks like it will have three floors . if the food and service matches the structure this will be a home run . i can ' t wait until it opens ! 
bought the sweet sara toasted coconut marshmallows at jimbos natural foods and will make sure to ask for a refund . i couldn ' t even finish one without spitting it out . i bought these based on the glowing reviews and found they are quite possibly one of the most sickly sweet and terrible rubber-like textures in faux-marshmallows ( ? ) on the market . marshmallows are supposed to have a slightly powdery texture , none of that here . not to mention they are loaded with corn syrup and you can taste it in the mix . why do so many vegan treats go overkill with the sweetness factor ? worst i have ever tasted . i don ' t understand what all the fuss is about other than it ' s trendy . these are horrid and i would not bother with any of their other fake ' marshmallow ' items after these wretched and over-priced lumps of corn syrup and cane sugar . 
this place is very tasty , the staff is attentive and friendly . i first discovered this place with a couple of lady friends . the staff was very nice to us ( even after i ' d shown up very late , causing our trio to monopolize our table for about three hours ) . since then my boyfriend and i have gotten delivery and take out from dar . delivery has been very prompt ( under N minutes and food was warm ! ) , when we get takeout they always bring us water , and on the chillier nights mint tea . overall , very nice restaurant . homey feel , while also offering consistently classy and delicious food . i highly recommend the chicken shwarma wrap . deeeelish . 
i had a large take out for the kabob and my whole group loved it in during the noreaster snow storm . i am a repeat customer also business does local delivery . quick and fast and tasty food . 
my family and i have always been pat ' s people vs genos . i can remember my first cheesesteak long ago when i thought the idea of processed cheese whiz was nauseating . but then i took my first bite . the plethora of oozy greasy squishy yummy cheesy glory transcended in my mouth . i am now a devout whiz worshiper . the whiz graciously gives it love to pat ' s fries too , a must have component . i also wanted to note that i saw an episode of ' food feuds ' on foodtv presenting a pat ' s vs genos challenge . no surprise pat ' s won . i guess genos does have some props , but pat ' s is simply the definition of philly cheesesteak grandiosity . 
personally this is way better than the cart on Nrd and Nth ave , which i have tried both sober and drunk . i heard that this got ranked one of the best food trucks in nyc , so i had to try it out once . i order the usual chicken and rice and smothered it with the white sauce . honestly , i savored every bite of it and definitely enjoyed it a lot better than Nrd and Nth . the only problem is that its in astoria , so if you ' re not drinking late nights around there , then you ' re missing out . 
pros the smith is lively , raucous , young and fun . the food is hearty , robust and flavorful . the cocktails , along with the rest of the menu , were surprisingly affordable ( for downtown manhattan ) . the service is friendly . cons loud . like madison square garden loud . the room is sprawling , and while the decor seems to reach for bordello-brasserie , it ' s never quite distinctive or intimate . the clientele mostly wore jeans and i saw more than a few bosox caps ( no offense to boston fans but dude , if there ' s a wine list , take off your hat ! ) . conclusion the smith is a great place for a group , a college reunion , or an internet date where you want to be easily distracted . not so much for romance . but hell , you can ' t have it all . . . ( and the chocolate sundae was good ! ) 
food is delicious and bernard is a fantastic server ! easy going , great recommendations . he really went above and beyond when i received a dish that was different from what i thought . thank you so much definitely coming back ! 
the pizza is ok but i had the worst chicken cheesesteak of my life . they didn ' t even melt the cheese . the people at the counter were also incredibly rude ! 
i ate here for dinner with my wife and a friend . i am a vegan , while the other two in the party were not , but we all agreed that the food was outstanding . i think that the " limitation " of being a vegetarian sushi place has really helped beyond sushi to think outside of the box and to come up with creative flavor combinations that are lacking from most sushi restaurants . none of us had ever had sushi like this in our lives , and i don ' t see how any other place could emulate their unique style . the owners and chefs are also extremely nice and accommodating . we ' ll be back ! 
i love this place . its fun and the drinks are good . only thing is food is not as authentic as i thought it would be . 
yum ! loved the mac and cheese here . it is absolutely fabulous . the fries were also great and of course , loved the pickle selection . my favorites were the spicy pickles and the green beans . the red beets weren ' t bad either . the only thing that was disappointing here was the shrimp and grits , and it wasn ' t even that bad . the grits were great but the shrimp was a bit tough over-cooked . warning--the shrimp come with their heads ! 
i love their iced coffee and it ' s a steal at N . N for a small . the atmosphere is quiet and cozy . i haven ' t eaten here yet , but everything smelled and looked great , especially the vegan cookies and i ' m no vegan . the service was a little . . . standoffish -- but i get the impression that is not status quo around here . 
delicious fried flounder dish and tasty boiled beef in sauce . there were mistakes with the ingredients but the owner was very kind in resolving our disappointment . bit pricey . overall good . 
i recently visited dive b r after a ' long ' day at work--and i had no idea what to expect . i went in solo , which can be a scary thing to do in west haven , yet i was greeted by a cheery young lady . now , composed and settling in with a snifter , yes snifter , of dogfish head , i began scanning the menu expecting the usual grease-and-salt standards . surprise , conch fritters and mahi mahi ! an actual wine list ! tourist drinks ! commercial-fee contemporary music ! i had a great meal , in a cozy room with a great view . finally , west haven has a good place to sip and nibble . 
okay , so it ' s got history and there ' s apparently an oven in the back that says this place dates back to N . that ' s all well and good , and perhaps this is the sole reason to even go to to soho ( unless you ' re a touristy soccer mom or prepubescent girl ) but aside from that , there ' s nothing elevating this place to legendary landmark status . it ' s the applebee ' s of pizza restaurants , and the interior feels exactly like that . instead of kitschy americana junk littering the walls though , you get more of the typical red-sauce olive garden decor . it ' s really just a giant t . g . i . friday ' s at the core though with typical N-something kids running the joint . you ' re really just a number , not a valued customer here . somehow , the quaint history of this place got lost in the process of making it accessible to tourists and thus exceedingly profitable for the folks who own this place . my experience though with this giant of the new york pizza world was actually not too bad . we were seated fairly quickly in the lower part of the restaurant , the table next to us was occupied by a handful of old-school brooklyn-esque italians chitchatting , shooting the breeze . if only they had those guys permanently on display there then this place would score a few more points on atmosphere . the pizza however , ( the standard gennaro pie which is your basic mozzarella , sauce , and basil pie ) leaves much to be desired . sure , it ' s a pretty respectable pizza compared to the garbage those fools out in chicago consider pizza , but this is new york . obviously you can do better . yes , it ' s a good thin crust but that ' s really about the only thing going for it . ( head to any half-decent brooklyn pizzeria for the same product but better ) there ' s no handcrafted love to these pies and it shows , you ' re getting a quickly made pizza that while good , is far from anything great . i suggest that you visit lombardi ' s once , as it is perhaps the last decent remnant of good manhattan pizza with a bit of history to it . the only reason i entertained the idea of coming here was because lucali ' s pizza in brooklyn was closed . aside from that , there ' s no reason to ever return to lombardi ' s unless you somehow really find their pizza to be something really delicious , which i don ' t . 
i have eaten at yummy sushi N times and it is the best . the food is always fresh and delicious . the wait staff is friendly . the atmosphere is casual and the space is clean , bright and sunny . a great sushi place in robbinsville , nj . 
this is my absolute favorite place to eat . it ' s a local business and the quality of the ingredients is superb . i recommend the " fire and smoke " sandwich . it is friggin amazing . the quality of the subs is way above that of of the chain sub shops . it may be a little pricy , but really , vt sandwich is the best . 
i went to this place for the first time last week based on a lot of recommendations . i was told they serve good breakfast and are open Nhrs . . . . my kind of place . when i got there at Npm i was disappointed to find out that they don ' t serve breakfast all day , but my disappointment quickly went away when i received my meal . i can ' t wait to go back and try breakfast . 
went to this restaurant because of the reputation . we were seated downstairs , awful . the pizza is ok , nothing out of the ordinary . 
eclectic spot that is sure to become one of your favorite brunch spots , your go-to late night snack place , and even your occasional hang out when you feel the itch to dance to some top N music with some Ns hits interspersed throughout . if comfort food is what your craving this place will satisfy your tummy- i ' ve heard their meatloaf is banging ! i love eating outside here for brunch or dinner and i highly recommend the fish tacos if they have them as a special . for brunch i prefer keeping things simple with their " breakfast special " but there is plenty of more adventurous options like their " cider braised pork belly hash " , their " shrimp and grits " or their " smothered chicken waffle " . service is always good , the bill is always cheap , and i always walk out of this diner full and happy . a philly " classic " for years to come . 
best sandwich place ever ! service is great , food is even better . best spot for lunch in montclair ! 
best sushi in south jersey . . . . . 
this is on a hidden chinatown street and i often overlooked it when i walked by in the past . i was attracted by the selection of noodles available and its low price . got their house special noodles , which includes a fried egg , beef tendon , beef tripe and vegetable for N . N . it is a tasty and low cost meal . the noodles are really good . i would love to try other types of noodles next time for sure . 
we have been going to this place for about N years , but i am finally putting up a review since i got an account now . . . we always love this place for great selection of meats other dishes ( any time we go , they constantly bring out the freshly cooked items ! ! ! ) also , the staffs are really friendly and always greet us with smile ! ! ! this is our " regular " local spot , and they will be seeing us as usual ! ! ! it seems to get especially busy on the sunday lunch . 
if you dont take this place too seriously , you will like it . if you want better quality thai , go to an authentic thai restaurant . the food is good for the price . its like going to mcdonalds and expecting great hamburgers , they might please some people , but they are not great . 
have been here a few times . the beer selection is good . the food is tasty . servers are friendly . don ' t know what else to say but it ' s a great stop in the city close to suburban station . 
cool
do not go if you like authentic thai food , this is toooooooo americanized nice decor though . . . 
it ' s been awhile since i ' ve been somewhere different . we ' ve found some local treasures and have pretty much kept to them lately . but when something opens a block from your home , with a connection to a place enjoyed previously , i ' m game . in a nutshell , this place should be a solid addition to the neighborhood vegetarians and vegans . for me , not so much . the service was solid . no problem there . the menu , though slightly sparse for carnivores , was a vegetarians dream . so we found one and brought her with us . she ordered the kale burger , which she said was very good , but with a bit too much roll . it came with a choice of chips , fries , or salad . she got the salad , and enjoyed it . the special of the evening was either a soft shelled crab sandwich , or a meatloaf sandwich . another at the table got the meatloaf , which reminded me of a brick of meat . it was not the best possible shape to be put on two pieces of nice grained bread , but a little difficult to manipulate . the meatloaf itself was fine . just fine , nothing more . it came with decent fries , mixed sweet potato and regular . the fried were deemed " ok " . the meat eaters shared a johnnycake pinwheel , which was actually more like a cornmeal pancake crepe with good brisket , sweet onion and pickled jalapenos . it was good , nice flavor , but not too much heat , even with the jalapeno . two of us ordered the storied fried chicken and waffle . a heavy cornmeal waffle had three thick chicken tenders on it , and it was drenched in a hot sweet bbq sauce . i ' m not sure what the actual coating on the chicken was , but it was a tad hard , and i really didn ' t care for the bbq sauce at all . too hot for my tastes . i ended up taking half of the waffle and two of the chicken pieces home for others who enjoy that for dessert , we ordered one piece of a carrot sweet potatoe cake that was also not very good . very , very dry . maybe as a result of being refrigerated , but i really don ' t care for cold cake , even if it was moist . so all in all , if i ' m going out to eat , i ' m not going back there . if i ' m going out to have a couple drinks and enjoy the night air , this is a nice place to go . the bar is fine , with a good selection of beers , and suitable selection of wines . four people , with lots of wine and lots of beers . . . tab came to N . N
my fave . . but i ' m upset that they only offer seafood spaghetti for lunch . also , i love to bring my out-of-town friends here , and i recommend getting the huge seafood platter ! 
mouth watering appetite satisfying . if you love tacos this is the place to try . fresh and all natural and not a stuffy environment ! 
i ' ve come here for brunch in the past which i don ' t remember much anymore except that i recall it was good ( passed my yummy test ) and i just came here for lunch with some female colleagues today and i have to say . . . deniro got this place right . it is great italian food in a classy ambience . the grandma ' s ravioli ( recommended to me by the waiter ) was the best tomato meat-based ravioli that i have ever had . this was just perfect and mostly meat ( instead of cheese ) and just delicious . and i don ' t even like ravioli , in general . but this was just great . the only thing i will say is the portions are too small here . i was still hungry afterwards . but at least i didn ' t have food coma afterwards at work in the afternoon despite the pasta lunch . ) 
love this place , hate the wait . my genius friends decided that it would be a good idea to bring a large party to this place on a friday night . not early , to beat the crowd , but right smack when all the crowds decided happy hour was over and needed food time . so of course , we had to wait at least an hour . crowds are to be expected if you attempt to go during prime time , they have a relatively large space in front dedicated to allow for people to wait . there is also seating upstairs , so that helps , but not enough since the lines were moving pretty slow . burger wise , it was good . i had the original umami burger . not too large to make you feel horrible for eating so much . juicy enough to not be dripping all over the place , but enough to keep the burger moist . the gang ordered a bunch of the fries , which came with four different dipping sauces ( sriracha , jalepeno , aeole , and house ketchup ) . i didn ' t care for the sauces except for the house ketchup which is different from the ketchup in the bottle . please skip the smooshed potatoes , its exactly what it sound like , which was uninspired and lacked seasoning . the sweet potato , truffle and regular fries were all done well . the onion rings were huge and came out piping hot . you can ' t go wrong with any of those . would i go back , probably , but i would try to avoid friday and saturday evenings . 
it was good years ago an it ' s still amazing . this is a real brooklyn place and a " must see " for brooklyn visitors . 
catas is about a Nminute walk from the harrison path train station and newark penn station . it is without a doubt is the best bar near red bull arena . the interior is stylish and spacious . the bartenders are great . the bar menu they created for the viking army supporters club is affordable and delicious . if you go , you must try the viking burger . the pre-match atmosphere at catas is second to none . a friendly yet passionate crowd gathers to watch la liga games prior to the red bulls matches . the singing and dancing can only be described as epic . there is also a handsome , charming young man who sings the N ' s classic " the final countdown " by europe on the megaphone . if you live in the ironbound or are heading to a red bulls match you gotta check out catas . 
based on the very solid reviews , a friend and i went to bahche on saturday night . i am completely boggled by all of the four-star ratings . i had a chicken pesto panini that tasted off -- there ' s no other way to put it . i took home a spinach phyllo pastry to go , and it , too , tasted off . both featured a weird bitter taste and an odor i ' m going to refrain from characterizing . but i don ' t believe the food had gone bad -- i think this is how their food tastes . mediocre and unremarkable are two words that come to mind . i ' ve never actually written a negative review on yelp -- i don ' t feel good about doing it , and figure there are others out there who will . but after having a really disappointing dinner for two last night and knowing that N ( including a N tip ) could ' ve been much better spent , say , at cubana cafe on Nth ave , i really felt like i needed to . the menu is very brief , and some reviewers had noted that . they don ' t really serve " dinner , " per se , although they said they are testing one or two entres every night . maybe this is a better brunch place ? maybe they ' re better at catering ? as others mentioned , the space is huge . and looks it when empty -- there was only one other table occupied in the entire space on a saturday night when lots of people were out . you ' d think the service would ' ve been attentive , but i can ' t even say that was the case ! i will give the waitress the benefit of the doubt and presume she was new . when a table of two orders one dessert , isn ' t it customary to serve it with two utensils so it can be shared ? last , the street is not inviting at night . i ' ve lived in bklyn for N years and i get it -- this area is turning around , millennials are moving in , etc . it ' s gowanus , not park slope . but the street the restaurant is on is not one you ' d be inclined to walk down , and indeed no one was anywhere in sight when we left around Npm . there ' s at least one body shop on the block and many of the buildings are either still warehouses or they ' re not currently being used however , it was too dark to know for sure . so all that said , i just don ' t get it ! 
old school diner meets fancy restaurant , we went on a sunday night during a three day weekend . the mojito martini was awesome ! ! ! ! and the food was delicious ! ! ! 
i came here last weekend with a couple of friends for brunch . we had the option of sitting indoors or outdoors . we chose indoors because the outdoors seating didn ' t look to appealing for us ( it could use a little bit of more decor ) . the indoors dining area is beautiful with an amazing view of the east river and the city . i definitely need to come back for dinner to see the amazing view at night . a few guests and myself were biased in regards to getting mimosas or sangritas , so our server michelle gave us samples of the sangritas to ensure that we would be satisfied with our drink orders ( that was extremely nice of her to do ) . she was amazing . . very cordial and gave us great recommendations . we were just going to order guacamole , but she suggested to order the crispy arepas ( which also have guac on them ) . boy were we all super satisfied and happy that we listened to her . i had the green gazpacho soup which was delicious and tasted refreshing like she had described to us . followed by the border burrito which was also a great choice . my friends all ordered churrasco and eggs . . they all enjoyed it , but would have liked a little bit of more flavor for the steak . the ambience was great . . good music . . we felt relaxed . . and boolent one of the managers passed by our table to ensure that we were having a good time . which was very much appreciated , and definitely made us feel more welcome than what our server had already done . overall great food , amazing staff , beautiful view , and definitely a place to come back to . 
the staff and food are great ! parking in the lot next door can be a little messy but well worth it . this place has become my sunday routine . 
double is more than enough for two . best sauce is the eggplant . mango is great for sweet , garlic and parmesean peppercorn for savory . extra points if you speak tagalog , since the staff is all filipino ) 
incredibly delicious burger with very nice side salad . great ambiance , friendly staff . . . definitely a win ! looking forward to trying some of their other options . 
we ' ve been to this bakery several times for their deli . we used to rate the food quality as excellent but more recently it is just average . the service on the other hand has moved from above average to severally below average . let me set the stage . there are a total of N workers behind the counters ( it ' s a big and long bakery ) , not including those " in the back " who prep , bake , etc . N-N out of those N employees are near or at the deli area . however , only one person will actually make sandwiches , provide cold cuts , or salads . and this one individual is very mean . he doesn ' t acknowledge you or have any eye contact . there is a good chance this might be why other employee ' s won ' t get near or assist . he is also very slow so the line just backs up . even though people were lined up before the Npm cut off for the deli , he yelled at them to go away and just left . it ' s just unbelievable we ' ve seen this happen the last two times we went . we will never return or recommend this place again . 
love this place . had my mom ' s b day there and they were fantastic . everyone there wanted to come back for another party
i so badly wanted this place to be my go-to spot . but alas , no . we live on the block and have visited about N times in the past three months . each time we have a new disappointment . service is not very friendly and they often forget you even if they are slow . my husband has gotten up to order from the bar or ask for the check because we were being neglected in our booth . cheese and charcuterie board was dropped off without telling us what was on it . . . then we found the meats to be really dry and cheese kind of " meh . " more than twice my wine has been really warm which i would understand from a bar , not a wine bar . no cellar temperatures here . prices are expensive enough ( N- N a glass for wine ) that i expected better . 
black bean spread for the bread is good . the drinks are strong ( no featherweights . ) arroz con pollo comes with avacado salad not on greens but amazing ! i honestly can ' t think of one thing that would have made this better . it is expensive but high quality food . 
the escargo is amazing here ( ordered N ) and i recommend the steak and frites ( medium rare ) . then you can die happily . 
stopped here for a family breakfast the service and food were both excellent . only downside was a slightly limited menu if you want something without eggs . 
concierge highly recommended tavola , then server recommended the artichoke and arugula salad --- incredible ! vendana pizza is great , too , especially with added garlic . delish ! 
great indian food ! ! ! so excited to have found this place . the prices are very low , and the food is wonderful ! get the galub jamun for dessert , it ' s the best i ' ve had in twenty-five years . now if we can only get people to go there so they can stay open ! 
amazing food ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the feta cheese is to die for . my favorite is the swordfish and the rice . the only reason i would give it N out if N stars is because sometimes the service is not the best . that ' s not to say that this place is not incredible because it is . the lemon potatoes are incredible and we come to astoria only for this restaurant . although i ' m sure there are others . 
yum . while most white chicken is usually dry and unsatisfying , there ' s no need to switch to dark meat for moistness ' sake . ( though the dark meat is also heavenly ) . i love this restaurant ' s concept . you can get in and out in no time with a box full of crisp chicken and a side of bacon mac and cheese . as a self-proclaimed mac and cheese expert , this is some of the best i ' ve had . and the sauces ! with nine to try - you better go back nine times . oh ! and don ' t forget breakfast and byo . the restaurant is versatile , trendy , and delicious . 
with your first look at the menu , it ' s disappointing to see that you have to pay for bread that is usually complimentary at nice restaurants . we decided to get it anyway because if you ' re going to pay for it , it better be good ! the little box of four rolls did not disappoint . there was a charcoal lavender roll ( the unanimous favorite ) , cheddar , sesame , and an unmemorable one . the homemade butter was so soft , smooth , and creamy . was it worth N ? probably not , but it was my birthday and i wanted some damn bread . we ordered a bunch of small plates and shared family style . we started with the charcoal scallops , which were tender and nice . the portions are as small as everyone says though . next we got the duck breast , which was cooked perfectly and flavorful . i was concerned it was taste " overly asian " because of the xo sauce and sesame , but it surprisingly wasn ' t . we shared the crispy whole sea bass , which was delicious . we couldn ' t pass up dessert since we were celebrating , so we got the ice cream ( the malted flavor was my favorite ) and a chocolate dessert that came out with a candle . they were all decadent . it ' s one of those meals where the portions are small and you ' re afraid you ' ll be hungry , but surprisingly you aren ' t . so then you think you ordered reasonably , but then you get the bill and you ' re like " oh , well , not that reasonable . " i ' m glad we waited for an occasion to come here . 
this is my favorite restaurant in new york and i have taken almost everyone i know here . up until a week ago , i lived a block away and i ' m so sad i am no longer in walking distance . the atmosphere is great , especially in the warmer weather because not only do they offer plenty of outdoor dining , the ground floor is all open air so its like you can be sitting outside even if you are inside . the decor is really cool with blue tile tables and yellow accents - you feel like you could be in a cafe in the mediterranean ( minus the aegean cliffs and blue water ) . i would definitely recommend getting the hummus to start - it is excellent and they serve it with this delicious , fluffy bread . be warned , the appetizers are small , but very good - i ' ve tried most of them and really enjoy the calamari and the crab cakes when they offer them ( i think it ' s a special appetizer ) . the portions for dinner are huge ( which is amazing , given the very reasonable prices . ) i usually get the beyoglu salad or when i want to splurge , the swordfish kabob , which is honestly the best swordfish i have ever had at any restaurant . they give you a lot of veggies and rice too so its a lot of food and you will definitely be able to take some home for leftovers . the tavuk izgara ( chicken kabob ) and both lamb dishes are also excellent . the only thing to note is that they have a N minimum for cards that they are pretty strict about so make sure if you ' re only getting a salad or appetizers to bring cash since the prices are pretty low . 
freshly prepared lebanese food is healthful and delicious , and wafa does it right and she does it with pride . hummus with olive oil was creamy and tasty . i had never seen split pea soup in a middle eastern context before but it was hearty and hit the spot on a cold and gray day . wafa came out to make sure all was to our liking . service by wafa ' s son was attentive and friendly . it is definitely worth a trip . 
a big thank you to karin and shawn d . for their reviews that led me here , this place rocks ! ok , i know i have only been here once and only had two slices and they were reheated end of the day slices , not fresh from the oven or anything but ya know if a slice is this good at the end of the day it ' s a good sign . i had two grandpa slices which was a bit like a grandma slice but a bit thicker , sicilian style square cut you know the deal . cheese on the bottom sauce on top . a little char in the crust and maybe the crust is a little oily . chunky sauce but not big hunks of tomato . overall , this was a great slice and i can ' t wait to come back and try more . pretty sure it was just plain old deck ovens , no wood or coal , no bricks from italy . not new haven style or thin crust or fancy schmancy , just a damn good slice o pizza . ( note i didnt get the plain round triangle cut slices that didnt look as magical to me ) i dont know anything about east hartford . it seemed like the middle of nowhere near a coca cola bottling plant . is it sketchy over here ? i didn ' t see any other people around and the pizzeria was dead at Npm and no cars on the road . it was pretty easy to get to over by rentschler field ( or however you spell it ) . if you are near by and looking for pizza i would check it out . 
went out to this place with a few friends from jersey and loved it . the food was great , drinks were even better and the servers were very friendly and responsive . i ' d make the trip out there again . 
love it ! great food , great people , great environment ! i ' ve been a couple times now and liked everything i ' ve ordered . highly recommend ! 
this is a great hidden spot on sullivan with fast service . their portions are great the people behind the counter are very generous , warm , easy-going . i highly recommend any of their falafel foods . their grape leaves have great texture and taste . last time i went their i also tried their beets dishes ( they have a beets eggs sandwich , and a beets carrots side ) both are spectacular with a slight spicy kick going . can ' t recommend it enough . 
royale seems to deeply understand the formula for a good burger joint . let ' s consider the formula for a moment the burger shiny sesame seed bun , flavorful meat , garden fresh lettuce tomato , onion . extra points for deli cheddar , spicy mustard and a side order of jalapenos . the onion rings luscious , greasy , and rich beyond belief . the price totally reasonable . my girlfriend an i have been there twice now and well on our way to completing our " royale card " - that ' s a free burger someday soon ! okay- you get the point , this place is really tasty . i love that royale is a classic burger bar . none of that fancy-dancy-burger creations stuff here . this isn ' t high modernism folks . nonetheless , i have one complaint . my can of coke was N dollars and N cents . come on guys , give me a reasonably priced coke to go with my burger ! ! ! pound for pound , royale is a keeper . 
i love this place . i even went twice in two days . i like that they have smaller options at low prices so you can try a few different things ( appetizers , tacos ) . they have a yummy brunch menu , particularly the eggless plato don , and their corn with chipotle mayo is amazing . i ' m not a big drinker but have had their margaritas , and my friends love the micheladas . one caveat is it can get really noisy when it ' s packed for dinner or happy hour , but the service is good , and so are the prices . 
i ' ve been to barcelona for the last time . the folks in my group who ordered tapas were happy enough . but several of us ordered entrees , which only appeared an hour and a half after we ordered . in fact , the entrees were served only after we requested that they be servedN times and we had finally cancelled our order . it was an outrage ! in the end we had no dinner . clearly , this place is far more interested in it ' s bar business than it ' s restaurant . don ' t go there unless you are searching for a bar scene . 
i ate here yesterday and the food was so great ! ! ! ! i was so impressed by the taste i will go back for sure . i had the large pho with rare beef and it was so huge . the taste was very authentic and flavorful . definitely not watered down . i also had the spring rolls which were fresh and good as well . the person i went with ordered the lemongrass beef with noodle and it was so good that i wish i ordered that too to take home . such good vietnamese bbq lemongrass beefy goodness . felt like i was in vietnam in my mouth ! ! ! ! ! 
one of the most kick ass bars in midtown . worth the trek to Nth ave since the tater-tots are crispy and the beers are nice and cold . the bartenders are pretty cool too . everything about this place is awesome , however try to avoid the sports team crowds and go in the mid-week or if there ' s no games playing on a weekend , go there . food great service good overall environment if the crowd isn ' t there , awesome . 
probably one of my favorite spots to frequent , can never get enough of it . constantly great food , service and drinks highly recommend platanos rellenos ( can eat this for the rest of my life and nothing else ) bandeja paisa ( colombian platter ) - a little of all of their goodness plantain crusted chicken ( one of my favorite simple chicken dishes out there ! ! ) plantain cursted and mango bbq sauce , need i say more any of the empenadas as good caviche is great as well drinks mojitos , margaritas and the earl grey ginger vodka all equally great
this place was fantastic . everything we ordered was amazing and the place has a nice charm about it . we went for lunch but i ' m going to go back another time after work for the bar and some apps . 
a friend was in town who was staying with his wife ' s friend in lic . i don ' t recall if i have an opinion of lic . anyhow , my friend ' s wife ' s friends were adamant about ' robin des bois ' , which i ' m going to call rotw here on out . while i ' ve never been to rotw , i was able to deduce the gist . i should mention that i don ' t like english beer or english-style beer . nothing against branding of generalizing , strictly taste . so , in order to satisfy my own palette , i went to rye prior to meeting up with said friend and co for ( unofficial ) brunch at rotw . timewise it worked out well . rye is one of those places unlike diner ( N bway ) that allows people inside prior to officially opening , which for diner , i feel compelled to add , is generally late . whenever that time is . i say this to say this it was a very good thing i went to rye . sat at the bar . too early for the crowd . ny times paper . didn ' t ( doesn ' t ? ) have a burger , so audibled with meatloaf with sunny side style on top . started with the scotch egg . it was all about the scotch egg . simply fantastic . then i drove to rotw to watch people eat as i had a mediocre glass of orange juice and a forgettable squash soup . also , the hostess or overseer of the hostess at rye was pleasant and patient with questions about what to get and eat . also curious to know my story , so i was frank about it . 
i love artichoke when it ' s the perfect slice . probably the best pizza i ' ve had however i wish the pizza was more consistent . i hate when my pizza is burnt and i feel like it happen more often than not . however when it ' s right it ' s right ! 
loooooove cafeteria ! ! go . now . hurry . order N ( ok , more like N ) cafeteria cosmos . yes , very N of me , but they are so yummy . prepare for an excruciatingly long wait ( ' tis ok , as you are armed with said cosmos , you smarty pants you ) finally be seated and promptly put in for an order of mac cheese . debate on all the yummy menu items , but settle on the grilled cheese sandwich tomato soup combo . marvel at how amazingly delish comfort food can be . walk out a very happy person . repeat next sunday . 
fabulous , fabulous , fabulous ! i actually didn ' t know that this was a restaurant rather , a hole in the wall pizza by the slice place . not at all ! the service was friendly , the pizza came quickly , and omg ! how i ' ve missed my east coast pies . . . this place is such a gem ! the pizzas are reasonably priced and custom made . i can ' t wait to bring more people here ! 
you know how restaurants in philly make dry horrible breakfast potatoes ? well grub house does potatoes right . in fact they do everything right at an awesome price . 
i went yesterday with some friends and we all had a wonderful food experience . creativity and their menu proposal , the taste of every plate was just delicious one of my favorites places in the world and dont forget to order the trucha , is memorable 
tiffany is known for there ribs are trust me they are amazing along with all there other food . it gets N stars for the service . they are never around when you need them . drinks barely get filled . they are nice thou . . . most of the time . the food gets N stars . service N . 
not bad . . . . . food ok . . . kind of pricey . . . . . waiters were friendly . . . . . would go back
this place is good , but expensive . having that said , i still loved the food ! i enjoyed the kare kare so much . kare kare is my favorite filipino dish , and they executed it so well ! the meat just fell off the bone , and i enojyed the peanut flavor . ugh . . so good ! ! ! ! ! ! i ate the whole thing to myself with the exception of sharing a few bites ! i came here with my N year old aunt , a friend and my caucasian boyfriend . i wanted my boyfriend to try a good filipino place , so i chose this restaurant . we got two rounds of the pacquiao ' s punch each since it was very tasty ! i also enjoyed the seafood sinigang . that night the didn ' t have the bangus or adobo that we wanted , but that just means we ' ll have to go again to try it ! ube rice was delicious . i was dissapointed they didn ' t have halo halo , but i did try it afterwards at their sister restaurant jeepney ( N ) . overall , i was impressed by this modern take on filipino food . 
this place is awesome ! ! the only criticism i could give is that the place is a little small but in nyc you can t complain . they have good drink prices as well as a boston lager was N and the house wine was N . we ordered the fettuccine pescatore and the taglierini sorrento . i was bigger fan of the fettuccine because of the sauce ( even though it was a bit soupy ) . the black ink pasta from the taglierini was the better pasta but i still prefered the fettuccine . both had a lot of seafood which was awesome as well . also , the food came out very quickly which was a big plus . overall , the dinner was not that expensive and i will be going back N 
the crab rangoons are very good and the portions are huge but the pork fried rice is so bland with no flavor and the chicken with cashews is not good either , also lacking flavor . too bad
came here randomly for a quick bite with a friend . the place was packed so we chose to seat ourselves at the kitchen counter in the back , which we sort of regretted because of the heat of the stoves . i think i could ' ve forgiven how cramped the spacing was had i enjoyed my food more . the patatas bravas was pretty good but a little too salty . however i was not at all impressed with the mushroom and chicken croquettes . i felt like i could ' ve bought them frozen at the store- they even sort of looked like they ' d just come out of the microwave . i found the roasted brussels sprouts with chorizo to be pretty bland as well . we honestly left feeling like it was a waste of stomach space . service was also kind of slow and i ' m pretty sure our waiter was either high and or drunk . still , i really want to like this place based on some of the positive reviews so i might be willing to give it another go . . . some of the other dishes we saw being prepared looked more promising . the atmosphere was lively and atleast the wine was good . . . 
i ' ve been here twice . the first time i tried the smaller dishes - perfect . the next time i tried the should of lamb - pretty good . next time , i ' ll probably stick with the smaller dishes as i enjoy tasting the variety of plates they have to offer . service was great both times . servers literally jump out of their way when you ' re walking and the next dish comes out as soon as you ' re finishing the plate in front of you . i like the seating in the main room but request the ' quarter ' if you want a more intimate feel . 
i ' ve lived in the nabe for the better part of my N years and to me it was just the local pizza place . when i met and married my partner ( who had lived in the neighborhood for a couple of years before we met ) this became the place for us to get pizza . she is truly in love with it . it ' s to the point where she basically just orders herself a small cheese pizza about once a week . i do love their pizza and they are generous with the toppings . i wish they had a little more in the way of offerings pizza-wise . i ' d love for them to branch out with say a buffalo chicken pizza or to have an option for a pesto sauce . but they ' re very no-frills and from the stream of people in and out of there they obviously don ' t need to change to please any of their true fans . to me it ' s strictly a take out place ( kind of skeezer inside ) and i will only get pizza or grinders . i am not into their hot meals too much . 
i went for happy hour yesterday and ordered a dozen oysters from the delaware bay ( my hometown ) because they were on special for N each during happy hour . there ' s a bar and a raw bar which wrapped around the seafood prep area . the space looks very big due to the high white walls and exposed infrastructure , but i ' m not sure howthe floor space would work for larger groups if the place got crowded . the tables seem to but up to the bars . nonetheless , i didn ' t see anything i disliked about the place . the oyster selection provided a variety and it was fun to chat it up with the guys working the raw bar . my friend also had the turtle soup and thought that was very good although a little spicy for her liking . will be back again if for nothing else to sit in a corner and eat oysters by myself . 
i love pizza and little italy has the best sicilian pizza i have ever tasted . friendly people with fast delivery service . 
this was the worst chinese food i have ever eaten , except for the soup dumplings . 
this is easily the worst restaurant in philadelphia . there was one waiter for the entire restaurant . he was distracted and had no idea what was going on . we waited N . N hours for our food , which was beyond mediocre . then he puts an N gratuity on a party of N , saying that it is their policy . it ' s my policy never to go back to awful restaurants , and it should be yours never to visit slate . slate should enjoy a speedy burial next to other comparable culinary disasters , such as midtown iv . 
while blue back square is dotted with empty storefronts , the restaurant scene is booming . newcomer umi sushi is a novelty , the first kaiten restaurant ( think japanese automat ) in connecticut . take a seat at the bar and grab whichever dish you fancy , as mango tuna rolls , veggie dumplings and all manner of sushi whiz by on the conveyer belt . no germ worries , individual dishes are covered , and the selection ranges from the familiar ( california roll ) to the adventurous ( sea urchin ) . bring the kids it ' s fast and fun , and the drinks alone will keep them well-entertained , if not sugar-buzzed surprising cubes of green jello float in the sweet watermelon tea . 
modern greek ? greek fusion ? i ' m not sure if these categories exist but they best describe nerai . there ' s the traditional greek fare but with a twist ( spicy feta , lavender mousse , pork belly orzo ) . however you categorize the cuisine i suggest giving it a try - recommend saving room for the dessert . 
it is appalling how this attendant behaved with us . so my husband and me gave our names to her and she told everybody to wait outside . her tone was bad however we understand it is her job and it ' s to maintain the decorum . my husband requested her if i could sit inside because i had fever with the allergies . here us what she said in an extremely nasty manner " she has fever and she is coming to eat " . i was flabbergasted at that comment of hers . i asked her if she has fever does she stop eating ? she said " i eat at home . and it doesn ' t make any sense . " is she ' s going to decide for us ? ? ? ? i told her she is being stupid . because clearly she was . she said " u call me stupid , get out " are you kidding me . this kind of behavior ? what did she think she was ? i would never behave like this with anyone . she is clearly spoiling totto ramens image . i know a lot of food bloggers . i am definitely going to tell this story . i know it might not affect anything for totto , but definitely this knd if behavior is appalling . i think she thinks she is serving god ' s food ! ! ! ippudo is so much better and the staff is sooooo good ! ! with best ramen in the city ! totto ramen is not even close ! 
i am picky , picky with chinese food and won ' t eat at most places , but i have been going to bergen dragon for years . the same family has owned it forever , they are very nice and gracious . the food is very good . i love the fried rice , shrimp egg roll , teriyaki beef sticks and steamed shrimp . great choice for chinese take out . 
awesome service at the bar ! i was having dinner by myself and the waiters were all so nice and helped dinner not feel so lonely ! best red velvet cheesecake ! ! ! 
so i ordered the burger medium-well , which , i know , is a very gauche burger order . that said , it wasn ' t terrible but was no father ' s office burger and i ' m sure cost more ( though you ' d never know since there are no fucking prices listed ) . but this brings me to my real complaint the waitress laughed at me . not just laughed , heckled me for my burger order ( which is due to an experience i had with undercooked meat recently ) . let me go on . the whole ridiculous gimmick with the writing of the menu on the table is simply an excuse for one of these american apparel glad bitches to shove her tits in the face of all men folk at the table . she was rude to me ( the only female ) so such an extent that even the men i was with noticed it . between no prices , the idiotic table-writing bullshit , the neighborhood , and the crowd , i don ' t why anyone who isn ' t N and just got here from ohio would go here . that said , the fish stew was excellent . but i would never , ever go back . 
jane does brunch as brunch should be done ! main piece of advice make reservations ! ! ! jane is hugely popular and is swamped with brunch goers . even the bar is fully packed , so unless you want to wait forever , make a reservation . when we went on sunday , i was worried they would give our reservation away after hitting a bit of traffic coming in . N minutes late , they had no problem accommodating us . . . thank goodness ! ! ! . . . once seated , service was attentive , timely , and friendly . i got the benedict jane , poached eggs atop crab and crawfish cakes with spinach and tarragon hollandaise . it came with delicious home fries . the meal cost N but also includes a breakfast drink like blood orange mimosa , peach bellini , screwdriver , or bloody mary . the meal was perfect . i also got a taste of the steak and eggs which came with a larger than expected juicy and flavorful flatiron steak . a great option for a more savory meal . loved the bread and strawberry butter too ! based most importantly on the great brunch food , but also on the affordability and service jane gets N stars ! 
if you are craving some fresh creative food you have to try this place ! ! ! ! the food is absolutely delicious ( if your pallet is not ruined by greasy fried food frozen meals from applebee ' s ) the staff are very friendly . the space is fantastic ! ! ! i felt like a kid again running up the stairs to play my favorite pinball game and they don ' t just have a few they had over N and that ' s not including other old school arcade games . great place to bring the kids , but i loved the late night crowd too ! ! ! there was some hipsters in there but so what . . . . . pinball ! ! ! ! ! ! 
a nondescript , shabby little dumpling house in downtown brooklyn that serves amazing food . a couple of tables are available if you want to eat-in . the dumplings are fresh and served rapidly . ( never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes ) . the prices are very affordable-- N . N for ten dumplings . check this place out if you ' re in the area . 
great ambiance . both the salmon and the filet mignon were off the chart amazing . only two complaints are N ) the wine by the glass menu was too limited and lacked any that i ' d consider very good , and N ) my server was somewhat unresponsive . but the food was fantastic , priced appropriately and presentation was superb . i ' d go back here in a heartbeat . 
definitely some of the best cuban food i ' ve had ! i love their croquettes , especially the cheese one . also the saturday special , ox tail is super delicious ! the regular ropa vieja and roast pork are also really yummy ! ! ! the staff is really friendly and we received great service . 
i was pleasantly surprised when , pressed for time one day , i poked my head into almaz cafe to check out the menu . enticed by the vegetarian options on their ethiopian menu i stayed for a quick lunch . the owner was incredibly friendly when i explained that i didn ' t have a lot of time . he assured me that my food would not take long to prepare . i had a seat and surveyed the interior while waiting for my food . the bright green walls and modern metal accents and bi-level construction give the space a warehouse like feel , yet it is small and intimate . my food arrived shortly and i was impressed with the size of the dish . the flavors were simple and fresh and just plain good . the injera was thin , spongy , and just the right amount of sour . when i asked for my food to be wrapped up , i was offered more bread to take with me . getting offered more food to go is unheard of , but much appreciated . everyone there was incredibly friendly , with good solid food in a very casual atmosphere . i will be coming here again . 
there is a new hipster organic cafe in town ! ) this place is beautiful and filled with provincial details- i loved it ! i had the sea salt caramel latte . . . it was so so , but the french baguette ( ham , brie and jam on a baguette ) was excellent . very reminiscent of some of the offerings across the street by red eye , but with much much much much better service . they really are wonderfully friendly and super attentive . i would come here exclusively but i ' ll miss my iced dirty chai from red eye . will have to revisit and give an update soon . ps- and this is silly but they have the most amazing hand lotion in the bathroom . even that detail is incredibly thoughtful . 
everything was so wonderful . the food was very well prepared and imaginative . we were served by knowledgeable , helpful wait staff who were there when we neede but did not interrupt . prices are reasonable for the quality and portions are generous . 
service was horrible . worst i have ever experienced . 
try the blood orange margaritas , as well as the chicken tacos ! 
my group of friends had a great night here , better than the dinner plans that also go N stars on yelp . i didn ' t try the food here , but we stood at the bar all night with cocktails in hand and got to unexpectedly sing two songs . it was a great night ! i ' m taking away one star because i feel like our experience wasn ' t the typical treatment at this bar . we had a great bartender who made the drinks strong and snuck us in to sing the first song ( even after they were telling people they were booked . . . which was probably around N Npm ) . after that , the karaoke guy came over and said " wow great song choice ! you can sing another one if you want ! " so we did . . . but i feel like everyone else ' s song got pushed back . if it wasn ' t for that one bartender and the karaoke guy our night probably would ' ve been like any other night out at the bar . 
so glad there is finally something good on Nth ave . great food , great wine , i ' m partial to the kale salad and the soupe de poisson . the chef guillaume really goes the extra mile to create an authentic french menu . on top of it the owner olivier is super nice and easy on the eyes ) i almost forgot the crepes suzette ! soooo good ! ! ! 
service was awesome - our friends were N minutes late for our reservation because they got lost , but the hostess was super chill and didn ' t give away our table or anything ! our server was also very knowledgeable on the menu and specials and have great descriptions of the most popular dishes . the food lived up to its reputation - my friends reported that their eggs benedict and steak and eggs dishes were delicious , and my special crepes were really good too ! their scrambled eggs were a bitttt too oily for my taste , but i know i have a very particular diet so i will give them the benefit of the doubt . i left brunch feeling full and definitely got my money ' s worth - the bill out out to around N per person . 
wonderful . been here twice . food is amazing and presented well . food is excellent and excellent value . a burger with fries and side salad included , all delicious is N bucks . staff are attentive and welcoming . beer is a bit pricey , and it can be tricky to tell what is on special . i will still be back often . 
a little pricy but definitely one of the best asian seafood places in town . a seafood hotpot is plenty enough for N guys . 
we ordered from the honey bakery for the first time yesterday and we were so impressed with the incredible pastries , we ordered again today ! chocolate pastry with chocolate creme was buttery and flaky ! the napoleon was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of sweetness . everything was as beautiful and visually pleasing , as it was tasty . the lamb and egg and sandwich is awesome ! the lamb was seasoned so well and the bread was really fresh and toasted . the coffee and the kimchi were extremely fresh and flavorful . last but not least we all loved the sweet salty sea-salt shortbread cookies , which are so delicious too ! the delivery person was really kind and helpful ! i definitely recommend this fantastic bakery . 
harvest table provides some of the freshest food available in downtown newark . the staff is always courteous and friendly , and make you feel as if you ' ve been there many times . i highly recommend it if you ' re in the area . 
not impressed . i was there recently for dinner with five others recently . this place has separate stands for everything which is great if you are only looking for one thing like pasta or seafood or dessert , but if you are looking for more than one thing it will be hard since you have to put your name down for the booths separately and hope that you can make it in time for the next booth . i don ' t know why others wow all over the food . i thought it was just okay . while they have a large selection of pastas and cheeses for purchase , what you can order is very limited . quite disappointed in the cheese and proscuitto plate since the cheeses weren ' t anything crazy , stuff like ricotta , gargonzola really ? in a cheese platter when you have all these fancy cheeses available on the shelf . fail . the boqueria market style area kind of worked since it wasn ' t that packed when we were there , but i could see this falling apart when traffic gets too heavy . i think i ' ll go elsewhere for my italian fix . 
great ambience , great music , great service . the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable ! highly recommended . 
speachless starting with a round of warm , soft ( perfect balance of flakey and doughy ) rolls with just enough butter and salt already prepared was the right way to start off lunch . followed by an order of chicken milanaise and spiced salmon ( substituted with musrooms rather than black beans ) . simple yet excellent in every way . being the only ones in the restaurant at the time gave us time to enjoy the beatuful architechture and elegant atmosphere . first time experience at grant ' s and most certainly will not be the last . now time to try their dinner . . . and next stop bricco ' s ! 
the wake up is awesome ( N ) . but it ' s not good for a sensitive stomach . your stomach will be on fire . . . the halloween delight was also nice ( N ) . it was definitely strong and a great fall drink . also , the shade margarita ( N ) was surprisingly good , too . on the rocks ! with salt ! the vibe here is good . it ' s a one-notch-above dive bar , i ' d say . a bit loud but not terrible for a group of N . there was a birthday party of about N that seemed to have a lot of fun , too . i will be back -- sans wake up this time . 
tried this place out while trying to grab something cheap and quick before heading home . they have a pretty good menu , and the prices aren ' t crazy . i was able to get a bowl of wontons in soup for N . N . my friends and i enjoyed the food here , and it ' s a decent amount of food for your money ' s worth . make sure you ask for some spicy sauce . the spicy sauce they have on the side has some pork bits in it ( not vegetarian ) and has the spicy chili oil . it ' s not super spicy , so you can use a lot of it , but the flavor is amazing ! my friend just scooped a whole spoonful to drop in his noodle soup because it tasted so good . note cash only . after you get the check , you can give the money to the waiter , or bring the check to the front and get it settled with the cashier by the door . 
the restaurant is a small homey-type feel , but nice enough to take a casual date - ) you have to get the african mussels . amazing . lamb chops are great too ! service is wonderful . they are all sooo nice there . great for a non-pretentious dinner out . they have N martini specials almost every night . and they let you bring your own bottle of wine with a corkage fee . and for you guys , my waitress was super cute . 
excellent food that ' s cheap and easy to get to from Nth street station . my favorite things to get are the mexican veggie burger ( with an egg ) and the tilapia taco . excellent food that ' s cheap and easy to get to from Nth street station . my favorite things to get are the mexican veggie burger ( with an egg ) and the tilapia taco . 
i am a cheese snob and never eat american " cheese " let alone whiz . . . . . . however , there is one and only one exception . i want my steak wit . . . . and no other way . nice bread and a good onion balance . the steak is ok , but all in all a good steak . always goes best with a birch beer . it ' s a piece of america that everyone needs to take a bit of . . . . . 
my girlfriend brought me here yesterday and i was so happy . amazing selection , quality meats and cheeses . fabulous paninis and sides . wine is delicious . cant wait to go back during the summer so i can sit out back . 
we went for dinner tonight with my N small children . my son and husband are both gluten free and we had heard rave reviews regarding their gluten free menu . i was a little nervous because the place came across as a restaurant not for small children . i asked the woman at the desk if it was ok to have them there and she was extremely welcoming to our family ( my kids are well behaved for N and N yr olds ) . she was very happy and welcoming to have gf diners . my husband ordered the gluten free chicken parm . it came with a side salad , but i was surprised to see when his entree came there were N pieces of chicken parm on the plate and nothing else . the chicken portions were a good size , and it was delicious , but they could have at least thrown some broccoli on there or a potato of some sort , N cheap , gluten free sides . for the price of the entree , i was a little disappointed . i ordered the gluten free pasta bolognese for my kids and they were nice enough to split the entree onto N plates without me asking . i appreciated this very much . the kids loved it . . . very tasty . i ordered the tricolore salad and asked if they could add some grilled chicken to it . he said of course . when it came , there was a small portion of salad , with N large chicken pieces on the plate . i was expecting a salad with some chicken tossed in , but this ended up being a chicken entree with a small side of salad . it tasted delicious , however when the check came , my N . N salad ended up being N . N . i was not expecting it to be that much . . . maybe a few dollars more , but i was quite shocked . overall , the staff and servers were very welcoming and attentive . the food all tasted great , especially for gluten free . however , if i ' m being honest , i do feel their gluten free menu is over-priced . we ' ve been eating gluten free for quite some time , and i know how much a pound of gluten free pasta costs . i get that there is a convenience factor involved , but it is very high . i very much appreciate more and more restaurants are catering to those who need to eat gluten free , but i feel this place ' s prices are higher than they need to be . will we be going back ? i ' m not sure . 
as someone we once worked in the meeting planning business , i ' ve arranged my share of parties and events . i recently approached the park central team about a birthday cocktail party for N guests . my wife and i had enjoyed our recent meals there . i also found the restaurant to be one of the very few in the new haven area that has a private room with its ' own bar and a seperate entrance to the kitchen . it was the perfect size for our crowd . not too big , not too small . it has a nice sound system , a large retractable video screen and enough seperation so as not to bother the other guests in the restaurant if you want to turn it up the music a bit for dancing . manager pete and chef tom could not have been more accomodating to our requests . they went beyond the posted private party information to custom craft a menu of specialty drinks and hors d ' oeuvres for our occasion . they even printed and displayed a special menu that provided a terrific remembrance of the evening for our guest of honor to take home . anyone who ' s eaten at park central in the past year can tell you about the tremendous work chef tom has done with the cuisine . it was great to hear the enthusiasm in his voice as he made his menu suggestions during our planning meeting . our guests raved about the quality and inventiveness of the items being passed during the party . from the duck confit blt " sliders " to the " fried chicken pops " , everything was tasty and served fresh and hot . we were provided with our own dedicated bartender and servers . they provided attentive , effecient " service with a smile " during the entire time we were there . nobody rushed us . . . we were able to pace the event the way we wanted . i also found the pricing to be very reasonable for the quality of food , drink and service we received . park central is a terrific place to host a party dinner . . . but at the very least i urged you to go there for dinner . there are enough terrific things to choose from on the menu that you ' ll look forward to coming back for more ! 
there are no words . but if i must , the vibe and ambience is awesome . chill and festive . i got the pork buns and classic ramen . ok , so then for dessert , gelato flavors green tea , earl grey , and black sesame . unreal . just straight up delicious . really nothing more to say . if you aren ' t here right now , then there is a problem with your life . 
damn good pizza . . . and luckily there was virtually no line . it ' s worth a trip out here if you are visiting nyc
food is amazing - period . its breakfast the way you imagine . no matter what day of the week you go , if you ' re going for breakfast you will wait . its a small restaurant and is extremely popular . not sure why there are so many reviews with people complaining about this - especially when your entire party isn ' t present -- be realistic , show up early if you don ' t want to wait - N minutes is average for me and i don ' t usually get there till after N am . i also wouldn ' t show up with more than N people - the place is just too small and from the looks of it , they don ' t have any intention on expanding . 
decided to go here due to great reviews but was not impressed . i was looking for a romantic atmosphere to celebrate an anniversary . the decor was pleasant and was quite enough for conversations . pros are the house roll pulled pork taco . cons , slow service , pasta was cold hard or under cooked , beef tenderloin was ok but expensive . we ended up just wanting to leave . tip if you ' re catching a show in the area and decide to go here , tell the waiter immediately so they will time your dinner accordingly . 
i love everything about ladur e . such an adorable and fancy little macaron shop . the presentation and packaging alone is very impressive . be prepared for a crowd , but that ' s obviously because the macarons are that good . but stay away from the rose petal one . 
a great neighborhood pub with an amazing pot roast burger and an excellent beer list of local and regional microbrews . kid friendly with a great outdoor porch in the summertime . their mojitos are to die for too ! 
so i returned to rucola , with super high expectations after my first trip here . the food was still very good , however not as fantastic as last time . ( i ' d give it N . N stars this time , versus N last time . ) i ordered several vegetable antipasti dishes beets , fennel , fried cauliflower , and the slow roasted parsnips to share . for my entree , i went for the brook trout , again . the vegetables for the most part were excellent ( especially the cauliflower ) . however , everyone at my table was in agreement that the parsnips were over salted . this was disappointing as they would have been incredible had they not had such a heavy hand with the sea salt . i had a bite of the sardi pasta again , which was as good as i ' d remembered . the texture was just impeccable . as for the brook trout , not as much attention was paid to it as last time , it seemed . the thinly shaved garlic did not garnish the lemon slices this time . the biggest disappointment was that the texture of the bottom half of the trout was a bit mushy . perhaps it was just frozen from the night before , as it was a sunday evening . for dessert , we ordered the four twenty blackbirds pie of the day a chocolate , oat , and pecan pie . crispy oatmeal was on top of a layer of chewy , sweet pecans . beneath the pecans was a small layer of chocolate ganache . this was served with some of the best whipped cream i ' ve ever tried . the pie was reminiscent of a freshly baked , chewy , chocolate chip oatmeal cookie . so good . i will be back to rucola again , though probably not on a sunday . hopefully if will be more consistent on the busier nights , as i was super excited after my initial visit , having found my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood . update i ' ve returned to rucola several times and have had nothing but great experiences since . also , i ' ve got to mention they have an awesome wine selection , , and the new rider was one of the best drinks i ' ve ever had ! 
so good . do it ! dined here with a friend randomly when i remembered reading some good reviews about this spot . it has a mature hipster feel to it ( we felt like fetuses at first ) and my friend - a long-time sunnyside resident , said she didn ' t recognize anyone in the place . i guess it ' s a sign the food is so good people go the distance to eat here . we weren ' t sure of who the actual employees were because the waiters and hostess were dressed in laid-back american eagle-esque attire which actually gave the place an unpretentious air . the space looked more like a long cozy living room with an urban outfitters playlist playing in the background . took me a few minutes but i liked the whole setup . i had the oxtail terrine and it was delicious ! i felt silly asking the waiter if the oxtail was boneless while ordering but didn ' t want to deal with picking meat off a bone . he didn ' t make me feel silly , said it was boneless and i was sold . the meat was succulent , fell apart easily and the exterior was slightly charred - just the way i like it . sooo good ! the mushrooms were also cooked to perfection and the sauces were great complements to the meal . my friend had the hanger steak and said it was cooked perfectly ( medium rare ) . our waiter warned us that the portions of most of the dishes were appetizer sized . considering the surrounding restaurants offer larger portions of great food less than or equal to the pricing of salt fat , and it ' s sunnyside , i ' d at least like to feel a ' good full ' after a meal here . also , waiters were super attentive and friendly . i ' d say the best service i ' ve received in a restaurant by far . yea , that just happened . bacon fat popcorn worked and the little probiotic drinks served at the end of the meal tasted better than the ones i ' ve had as a kid ( maybe i ' m old enough to appreciate them now ? ) . i would definitely go back to try other items on the menu . 
steps from the lunt-fontane other theatres . after watching the addams family musical we started walking to our hotel at the same time people watching- stumbled across this hole in the wall pizzeria- it is very small cramped as with all the other reviews describe . they sell pizza by the slice , whole pies , some desserts , etc . i had a pepperoni and they custom made a sausage for the wife so that took a little time . there is alot of foot traffic in this place . the staff is very very very friendly and accomodating . average rating for this place is N stars , some N stars and some N N stars- don ' t get me wrong , but the pizza was just o . k . with me , it wasn ' t a stand out making me holla- wow this is the greatest pizza i ' ve ever had ! nothing like that . . . . . N . N stars for me . give it a shot if you ' re in the area ! 
i just read an article from nypost about this restaurant , and i must say , wow . i ' ve never been to this place , and i doubt i ever will . i am from new orleans and whether or not the food is good the boil is insignificant . gloves , bibs and claw crackers ? ! ? what a bunch of pussies ! you would be laughed at if you ate crawfish like that in louisiana . notice i said crawfish , not crayfish . and the prices ! my goodness y ' all are getting raped ! slapping hand to forehead in utter disbelief . the only reason i gave it one star is because i had to to write the review . 
we frequent this restaurant as it is the only decent restaurant on plainsboro rd . i always order the pad thai while my husband experiments with the curries . i have always enjoyed my food . they make food with lots of flavor and fresh ingredients . they will also increase or decrease the spiciness of the food on request , which is nice if you feel strongly either way . this place is definitely worth a stop if you live in or frequently find yourself in plainsboro . 
happy hour . my negroni was good , my saison was expensive but very good . the brisket tots and buffalo sweetbreads both live up to the hype . and considering they are listed as " snacks " the portion sizes are generous . bartenders were solid and professional . i would be eager to come here for dinner service , the menu is intriguing . flatiron doesn ' t seem to get the respect it deserves , there are a ton of great places around here and this place just made it even better . 
even if your bank account is fat enough to dine here , i ' d save the money and go somewhere better . . . twice . i seriously don ' t understand what the fuss is about . the place is pretty . well decorated . and the service is pretty fantastic . but i dined here for the second time and it was the same ok experience as the first ( and last ) time hit or miss food , and way too high a price tag for what it is . the specialty pasta which was billed as featuring fiddlehead ferns was excellent . . . but may have had one fiddlehead in the whole N dish . the bruschetta was burnt and accompanying mushrooms were overcooked and flavorless . the pork croquette was a bright spot with truffle and a delicate egg setting off the salty pork . gnocchi in brown butter was ok but i probably could make as good a sauce at home . the stuffed trout entree ( about N ) was another highlight--a bit overcooked but stuffed with black olives and other goodness . desserts were also good , not great--didn ' t exceed my expectation . the price tag , however , did exceed expectations--my first meal , a casual one at the bar , was around N , and that was for one shared app , one app , and one drink . i left hungry . last night ' s meal--much more than twice that . bread is exceptional and cocktails inventive , but overall overrated . 
i went to the smith after being turned away by a bakery , that shall remain nameless , at about N in the morning on a saturday . i see during most of the day it is pretty busy based on the other reviews but at this time there were only about N other people dispersed about , so the service was pretty good and attentive . its one of those dimly lit places that bring water out in vintage wine bottles and politely gives you the ok to get up and close with your significant other . good selection of ny breweries but what we came looking for was desserts . i have got to admit , this isn ' t the place for that but they had a good variety of sundaes and their fresh fried chips with blue cheese were just as appetizing . paired with some really good coffee and your good for a night out in ny . 
really good food . many people get turned off because of the location but trust me its fine and the crowd is very pleasant . its good for dates and happy hours with friends or family dinners . theres also small plates of bites you can mix and share . 
loved this restaurant . this is probably my favorite place in the city . i love french food , and parc has a lot of variety on their menu . each time i go and try something , there are ten other things i wish i could also try . so far i have gone there for brunch three times , so i ' ve had their salmon eggs benedict , which was perfect . the eggs cocotte were good , but the portion was very small . the caviar on top was an excellent addition , though . their french toast was also very good . in terms of drinks , their mimosas are just classic mimosas - so they were decent . the chocolat chaud ( hot chocolate ) was the real deal ! they also have a nice selection of teas . i ' ve also had their macorons - they were just right - not too soft , not too crunchy . i loved the setting in rittenhouse square and the ambiance . it feels like you were transported to paris . can ' t wait to return for another brunch . 
took my mother and brother there for lunch . pizza was good but the entire meal was overshadowed by the horrible waitstaff . i was appalled at the way the staff greeted us . it seemed as though we were interrupting him watching tv . told us to sit anywhere and we walked to the booth and he said noooo , ( as though we were stupid ) and said tables only , booths are for N or more . keep in mind , they were not busy . we ordered a large and a small . the small came out first and a blonde man with a mohawk just sort of threw the pizza on the table and said nothing and went back to watching tv . pizza was sent back because the green peppers are pickled . although my fault , i was surprised that my server said nothing about them being pickled when we ordered it . as a server for over N years , i usually give my customers a head ' s up when we serve something that most people don ' t expect . and i don ' t think most people expect pickled green peppers . the place itself was nice , however , it was dirty . staff was standing around , texting , and watching tv which was surprising because they could have sweeped or cleaned the dirty tables that were around . overall , for us the bad service was what we walked away talking about , not the pizza . i ' d rather go to delorenzo ' s on hamilton ave or it ' s nutts in titusville rather than ever going back to this place . hopefully the owner has a talk with his staff to correct these issues . 
the inside of the diner is cute and cozy and has that diner look and feel to it . i stopped in for lunch with a co-worker and i hadn ' t been there in a very long time . i had the broccoli-cheddar omelette and my co-worker and the andros omelette . it took a long time to receive our lunch orders even though the place was almost empty . omelettes shouldn ' t take that long but it seemed like N-N minutes . the omelettes were fine . my co-worker thought her omelette was a bit on the cool side and not hot enough . coffee was ok . the service was acceptable and friendly even though the waitress didn ' t give us any jam with the toast and we had to ask twice for water . the place was clean and warm especially since outside was brutally cold with snow everywhere . prices were very good compared to another diner in the area that charges outlandish money . i would go back . 
came here for sunday brunch . made a reservation for two . food you can never really go wrong with bottomless sangria - preferred the red wines over white , especially fresas . as for food , i ordered the ropa vieja con huevos . delicious . perfect portion . although i wanted more . . . my friend ordered the vaca frita . steak , so yum . mouth is watering as i write this review . i love mexican food . service excellent - was always ready to refill our sangrias ! the warnings in the menu for bottomless sangria was hilarious . some qualms . . . the food took a while to come out . and , i didn ' t like seeing waiters carry tubs of sangria around . . . reminded me of boxed wine . . . ambiance was not what i expecting . . . didn ' t realize it was tucked inside a hotel . super lively - must be the sangria . super spacious . i will be back ! 
this place has the best cheese sticks in town and service . they even have little music boxes at each table ! ! ! 
i was reimbursed within days . great customer service ! i will give this spot another try ! 
birra is a wonderful addition of the passyunk ave crew ! i am always up and down that area and it was time for a new place to come up ! cheeseburger pizza with roasted tomatoes and pickles ahhh so good ! also the bartender was on top of everything for being as packed as it was on one of their opening nights . i walked in and was immediately pleasantly surprised by the set up and bar , it is a beautiful space and the fact that you see your pizza going in and out of the brick oven is a plus ! you know it ' s really fresh . andd . . . the crust is amazing , the key to good pizza is the crust and they nailed it ! i expect great things for this place and i cannot wait to go back and try the duck confit pizza ! 
i really don ' t know what all the great reviews are about . i recently when to pio pio with a group of N and i don ' t think N person was wow ' d or even moved enough to say they ' ll be back . where to start ? our waiter either hard of hearing or did not speak enough english to be serving food . he offered his assistance if we had any questions with the menu . . . cue the vegetarian referrals for my wife . the birthday girl was seated closest to the waiter and said " she ' s vegetarian " pointing to my wife . usually that ' s enough for any waiter to start pouring out suggestions of what she can eat " congratulations " is what ours said then turned away . full on beer and free hot dogs from rudy ' s i was looking for more of a little something not so much a meal . at this point we decide we ' ll just split the asian fried rice with veg instead of chicken and a salad . i ordered with the waiter in spanish to ensure there was no meat and my order was correct . the rice - for N i think there was less then in your average large take out container . i know we ' re in a nyc restaurant , but come on were talking N . there is a way to justify N rice , but then it has to be good and this was not . it literally just tasted like soy sauce and not a thing else . i eat vegetable fried rice all the time and this was very low on the charts . . . by take our standards . the salad - never came . come on man i ordered in spanish . . . you confirmed in spanish . the sangria was ok . at the end of the meal of course everyone did the whole " how was yours " thing . when i literally heard the word " meh " at one point i realized . . . N stars . i must say it ' s really nice inside . 
made my fourth trip to alta , it did not live up to my previous visits . not sure if they changed chefs . i would try it again , maybe it was an off night . if it isn ' t better , i would not go back . 
apparently this is the place to be right now ( summer N ) ? the wait was very long , even around Npm . we went across the street and stayed longer than the proposed wait time , but they held the table for us anyway ) the truffle fries are delicious , and the five leaves burger was very good . i ' m not sure about the beet and pineapple - a little sweet for the burger ( two sweet things ) and was a pretty thick chunk , so couldn ' t mask it . i guess i could have taken it off the burger , but didn ' t do that ) ricotta with honey on raisin pecan toast was a great starter . very busy and hopping . 
great burgers and fries . you must try the bash style with the bacon jam . probably one of the top N burgers in the city . cooked medium , so it is rare enough to keep the meat tender , but not overly bloody . this is the way every medium burger should be done . the fries were crispy and plentiful . a little pricey , but i highly recommend this burger . 
i haven ' t been to sripaphai for about N years because i didn ' t usually take a trip to queens , ny . i went there again last weekend , the food was still awesome . there is a variety of food . i ordered crispy chinese watercress salad , fried taro , and fried whole fish with garlic and pepper . everything was delicious ! there are desserts in the freeze ( next to the front door ) , just in case you are full with all the foods , but still want some desserts to go ( like me ) . they except cash only ! 
awesome food ! ! but , service was slow wasn ' t that friendly
kansai is our " go to " place in our spring garden neighborhood and is our place of choice when we want a delivery . my wife and i love the friendliness of the staff and the freshness of the ingredients . the prices on their sushi and sashimi items are really affordable and i like their display on their rolls . the salad is nothing to cheer about but the dressing is a tangy , spicy treat . we get the salad because of the dressing
i don ' t remember this place being so bad ! i came for lunch a while ago , and thought it was fine . but this time , my dinner experience just made me flat out angry . it just felt like a cruel joke . food on par with lunch specials ordered on seamless . we started with some appetizers . the shime saba was probably the best of the worst -- average at best . the pork betty was just a sad , small piece that did not have a good texture and was not a good balance of fat and meat . the short rib bbq was like a chinese take-out beef lunch special . had a bunch of the sushi rolls , and they were just your regular ol ' midtown sushi lunch special rolls ! a complete disappointment . i had the sushi taco sampler for my entree -- and , oh boy , was that a huge mistake . it tasted just like the damn rolls ! and not in a good way . the udon was also disappointing . the broth was more bitter than anything . the noodles were super soft and had no bite . it ' s pretty obvious that i will not be back . and i want to try to help the others that appreciate good food to avoid this place . avoid , avoid , avoid ! ! 
i was overjoyed to find cheap , delicious , authentic mexican food within delivery range of my apartment in the east Ns . the first time i ate there was on location , snagging of the N-N tables at this teeny tiny restaurant . they were clearly doing a brisk delivery business , but going there was fun . it ' s byob and four of us got a few things to share . definitely try the cemita ( we got the spicy pork ) which is a kind of mexican sandwich . outrageously delicious . we also tried the chicken enchiladas which were my Nnd favorite . the owner was in the back cooking , and his son came out to chat with us . the son was very proud of the enchiladas and the fresh salsas , which he personally made . his dad was responsible for the rest of the menu , made up of recipes he got from a cook friend and his mother . i can ' t wait to go back and eat my way through the menu ! 
great food at a reasonable price . zaru soba was excellent and the yaki udon was perfect . gyoza were high quality and the service was fast as efficient . 
every time i come here the food is always great . their dishes are very fresh and i ' ve never had a meal i haven ' t liked . i enjoy sitting outside when the weather is nice and i really like the fact that this is a byob . my only concern is the waiting time before you are seated . even if you make reservations , there is often a wait . otherwise a great place to grab dinner . 
i had a rib eye steak and some calamari was like rubber but stake was great and there desert was good too but way too sweet i wasn ' t too crazy about the place but overall it was okay
something horribly wrong here today . they were more than N hours behind in filling food orders . we got there around N N pm and no food at N N . at N pm , when i went to ask about our order , they were filling orders about N s behind mine . others who had run out of time were asking for refunds . i tried to be patient asking how much longer , where was my order , etc , but was told for over N minutes that a manager would need to come deal with this problem . the manager never came and they had no explanation or estimate as to the expected wait time . next , many machines did not give tickets and many took money w o giving play credit . also , i was trying to find a better chuck e cheese than bridgewater as i thought that bridgewater was understaffed - too long of a wait for the prize line ( over N minutes sometimes with no on at the desk ) and had a broken a c in over N degree heat during a crowded summer day . east hanover a c working fine , but also understaffed N minutes wait entering and leaving and perhaps N minute wait to put in order and get prize . no response to comment that machine had taken N tokens of child ' s money w o giving credit . i have to say all the front line people at bridgewater are nice and hardworking they just cant cover N-N jobs by themselves on a busy day . i observed the same problem here the counter person had to work cash register , drinks prize desk and customer service . the greeter was also waiting tables . the manager was also waiting tables . i never liked the noise of these type of places and have had enough . will not be patronizing any more of these , especially as their trend is to put smaller and smaller play areas . 
this place is so cool , the best dishes were the noodles and the taste was crispy and fresh just great , very relaxing place , clean and i will come back there it ' s really nice
i ' ll describe this place with the N cs cozy , scrumptous , cool , cash ! okay , you got me it ' s not really N cs , but they still offer a pretty good filipino meal ! cozy small place but i hear they have a backyard area which they open in the warmer months . a reservation would be a good idea . great for intimate party . scrumptous food is pretty tasty . we went family style and ordered spam fries first time having them and they were actually good ! sizzling sisig had this before and it ' s pretty decent here . kare kare oxtail is really tender . stuffed chicken also pretty good ! mussels appetizer decent . coconut flan just a hint of coconut , but pretty nice . cool great ambiance and vibe . the wait staff is super friendly and really knowlegeable about the food and drinks that are served . cash no credit cards so come prepared ! overall , pretty nice place , would definitely return ! 
the food here was good , though not great by any stretch of the imagination . lunch portions were a bit on the small side . it ' d be a three-star venue if not for two things N ) the service was very good . our waiter was polite , attentive , and helpful , but not intrusive . i ' ll admit that the place was nearly empty , so few other tables competed for his attention , but he was still very good . N ) the semi-sweet chocolate fritters desert was amazing . possibly the best desert i ' ve ever had . yum . 
i am salivating as i write this review just remembering all the tasty tasty dumplings i have eaten ! my favorite by far is the crab and pork soup dumpling and it is now on the list of things i occasionally crave like crazy till it ' s in my belly . the scallion pancake , shumai , and chinese broccoli are also very yummy . i have yet to eat a dish i did not like from this kitchen and i love trips to the restroom just so i can watch some of the hand made dumpling action . they are cash only , but you won ' t need to bring much . on a budget , you can eat your fill and be pleasantly shocked at your bill . 
i had dinner here last friday with friends and came away very impressed . i started with a pasta to die for ( cappelletti ) . i split the bistecca with a friend and enjoyed it . i will definitely find my way back here again . 
sitting here for N minutes and the place i empty . no one has come over to the table , so we are leaving and this place is on the " never return list . " 
ippudo is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in nyc . having originated from a japanese chain , it ' s no surprise that ippudo serves the best ramen in the city . on any given night the wait time can range from N minutes to N hours ( and is usually on the higher end of the spectrum ) but the food is always worth it . they also have a N for N happy hour special on kirin and sapporo to help pass the time . my regular at ippudo is an order of pork buns to share and the akamaru modern which uses a rich traditional pork bone broth base . the pork buns are a must and are way better than the ones at momofuku in my opinion . the ramen is served piping hot , flavorful , rich , and perfectly prepared . if you ' re looking for something a little more traditional , the shoyu and miso are good options too . and for those with large appetites , the option to " kae-dama " allows you to get a second order of noodles to help with that left over broth for just N . the service is excellent and the modern japanese decor creates the perfect environment for me to enjoy my ramen . if you ' re in nyc , ippudo is a must try . 
mac and cheese was a huge pleaser . but the waffles got me ! ! ! great food great service . def coming back . 
very slow service for a sunday night . it took N minutes for our drinks order to arrive ( just two of us ) . our salads arrived shortly afterward and they were quite good . then , another N minutes for our entrees to arrive . the table next to us arrived N minutes after us , but received their meals N minutes before we received ours . my wife had the scallops , weirdly prepared with curry . i ordered the ahi tuna , which arrived quite cold with a sloppy wet bed of " sauteed " peppers underneath . yes , ahi tuna is served somewhat raw , like sushi and that ' s how i wanted it , but it ' s not supposed to be cold like it just came out of the refrigerator . the fingerling potatoes on my plate , however , were hot and fresh . overall a strange and unpleasant experience at what is allegedly a fine restaurant . this was our valentine ' s day dinner ( delayed a couple of days because of snowstorms in the area ) . this was my first time at grants . it was also my last time at grants . there are far too many good restaurants in the area to even bother with giving grants another chance . 
neighborhood gem . awesome panninis and flavor combination . great for a casual , and very tasty meal . very reasonable price for the level of quality . friendly staff . did i mention good food ? 
it ' s aiiight . N glasses of wine ( i am gasp not into the lychee ) are what brings me here with the girls . we had a table last time--such a great move as we saw the place get packed and then thin out again several times while we were there . verlaine is very les , though a couple of things make it a little better . the high ceilings make it feel less cramped ( it ' s still pretty small and narrow ) . the drink specials are better than most places , and it was cleaner than most places ) 
amazing food . go here . no questions . middle of nowhere but best tacos i have ever had . 
i ' ve been wanting to try sultan gyro for quite some time . well , i did today , and was thoroughly disappointed . service was ridiculously slow , and the guy at the counter didn ' t even seem to know what was on the menu . i wanted a lunch special , it was N pm , so i wasn ' t sure if it was still lunch or not . i asked , and neither he , or the other people working there seemed to know if it was still lunch or not because " the manager isn ' t here " . i waited forever , i saw the meat was heated up in the microwave ( even though they preach fresh ingredients , etc . ) . it was cheap ( only N . N ) , but totally mediocre and not worth the wait and hassle . the people working there acted annoyed that i was bothering them , they were all busy watching something on tv . would not recommend , and i won ' t be going back . 
the calamari used to come with an aioli and seasoned with a nice salt mix and fried to perfection . no more ! the menu changed and seems so did the chef . 
green lemonade . solid brunch . friendly service . i ' d be back . 
i ' ve been here several times , and generally , i would give this place N stars for food and about N . N stars for service . the burgers , fried chicken , and egg dishes are delicious . i also enjoyed the all you can drink bloody marys - very tasty , spicy and tomato-y ! however , they have a lot of kinks to work out with the service . i ' ve had two horrible experiences here - once , i came for brunch with a group of six , and when it came time to pay , we all threw down N bills to cover a total tab of about N , expecting to receive change . instead , the waiter took the entire N and pocketed a N tip for himself instead of returning any change . when we asked for our change , he got very belligerent and started arguing with us " well you guys should have told me you needed change , you really want me to go back to the cash register and get your cash back ? that ' s too complicated . " eventually a manager had to get involved . i haven ' t seen that waiter since , but be aware that you should be very careful to request your change . second , just this past sunday i returned for brunch when they were relatively busy ( but not full ) , and my dining partner and i waited for forty minutes for our food . we were seated right before noon , waited N minutes to order , and received our first dish ( his chicken and waffles ) around N pm , and finally received my egg breakfast around N N pm . our waitress apologized profusely and we didn ' t blame her , this seemed like a kitchen that needs to learn how to handle a moderate level of customers without getting ridiculously backed up . finally , there are little things about their service that have consistently bugged me when i ' ve gone . first of all , i wish they were more attentive when it comes to filling drinks . the last time i went , i didn ' t get a single coffee refill during our N minute wait for food - i had to flag down a server to eventually get one once our food had arrived . second , they ' re not very good at remembering to bring the appropriate sides with the dishes ( ie , ketchup with potatoes , syrup with waffles ) and usually you ' ll have to request these things . still , the food is good , and hopefully they ' ll get these kinks worked out with better kitchen management . 
love this place top quality food ( grilled cheese sandwich is awesome ) , friendly staff , interesting crowd probably from the neighborhood ( if you like hipsters and artistic fashion people ) . i definitely recommend it , they also have a little shop at the front with fresh products , pastries , chocolates to gift . . . the only thing is the restaurant part is very small so might be not as nice when too crowded
gaia italian caf is a nice place for me , good for food and dessert although slow in serving food but i admitted that i love waiting when ordering those screamly delicious lasagna and salad . everytime we eat together with my girl we cant help our self to like it . and obviously with the people here , talking the good with this caf . the place luring people because of there food and ofcourse with the cool owner and services . they asking that how are we . worthy enough for a person like me to have this kind of place where i can relax anytime specially summer is heading now . i cant wait to go there again . 
i just joined yelp to testify to absolute gastronomic atmospheric delight that is cubana social . does that sell it ? well , let me give you three other reasons why it gets my five stars any day of the week- N . the food . the empanadas- picadillo are my favorite- are juicy , perfectly seasoned with a flaky crust , the yucca fries with garlic make me want to cry and that kale salad ! i understand why vegans are vegans ! ( sometimes ! soooort of ! ) N . the drink ! amazing drafts ! awesome house cocktails that are quite smartly prepped by some of the handsomest ladies in williamsburg . N . the location . seriously . you can grab food from their to-go window ( ! ! ! ) before dancing at public assembly or catching a show at the music hall . pretty perfect stretch of north Nth a . k . a . far enough away from the dross pouring out of sea and american apparel . see you there , folks ! 
good food with a twist but a touch too high in price . nice service . takes reservations . 
they have the best prime rib i think i ' ve ever had it was so tender , juicy and rare . my wife had the beer brined pork chops . i tried them and they were very flavorful . they have a decent irish beer selection . my wife had a cocktail which she liked . an all around good experience . 
best pizza in the world ! i am not exaggerating . dom is a pizza master and makes everything right in front of you . the quality of the ingredients is obvious from the taste . the only downfall is the wait but this is best pizza you will ever get ! 
the best ! good atmosphere , great food , awesome staff ! ! ! 
five stars . why ? can ' t think of any negatives . i ' m disappointed at the low star reviews . " no disposable chopsticks . " " no one picked up the phone . " really ? reviews like this are the reason why people are absolutely killing the usefulness yelp . had the zenbu no se . it was . . N ? great presentation , great broth , good meat , and i loved the thin noodles . the girlfriend had the vegetarian ramen . this was one of the better vegetarian broths she ' s tried . great service , clean restaurant , no wait , and they have a tv which they show sports on ! what ' s not to like ? agedashi tofu - i ' ve had better , but not worth arbitrarily docking a star . we ' ve got some background exploring ramen . . we ' ve been searching for the best ramen in nyc ( it ' s ippudo , if anyone is curious ) , and i ' ve tried most of the ramen places in and around san francisco . this place is good . go here . 
where do i start about marcopolo , from there amazing pizza slices to great pasta dishes that are very large there reasonable prices and last but not least great service if you go there once next time they see you you ' ll be treated like family . . . " great place to visit if you are in new haven " 
i have been eating here for N years , and ever since a new manager has come in , i cant stand to go into the place . my husband dragged me in for brunch at noon . the appearance along upsets me , with its newly wallpapered walls . the character is completely gone from this place . the new pasta dinners ? a total ripoff and utterly disappointing . the waiter was completely bored and unattentive . i dont even know if they have hosts because no one was at the stand the entire time i was eating there . i ordered blueberry pancakes and they were still good , but half the menu i used to eat is gone and the experience i used to go there for ( academic conversations , good breakfast food all day and night , writing on the tables and walls ) is completely gone . not gonna be dragged there again . i ' d rather go to winberries . 
i didn ' t find the food here to be tasty - at all . i thought i ' d get a club sandwich because their roasted turkey , bacon , mayonnaise , and cabiatta bread would all be special in some way , not just ingredients i ' d rather buy myself and slap together - which would have probably tasted better anyway . the brie did not seem fresh or very good and the carrot soup was bleakly sweet . i ' m not one to criticize too often , but i was disappointed by caf henri ' s attempt at french food . 
i want to know why places like piccolo cafe don ' t exist everywhere . they really should . this place makes legit italian food , and it doesn ' t break the bank ! score . i will admit now that i was one frustration away from a meltdown when i arrived at piccolo . ( eating well and on the cheap in a foreign city , especially manhattan , is hard , y ' all . ) so when we finally got to piccolo after a long , hot day of playing tourist and realized there was no booze for sale in the joint , i nearly had a hissyfit . i ' m glad i thought to ask whether they are byob , because they are , and there ' s a liquor store next door . ( i may have come even closer to said hissyfit when i realized i didn ' t have a corkscrew for the wine i procured , but that ' s really another story about how my guy is the best , and thus , not appropriate here . ) so . piccolo is teense . there ' s just enough room for a few tables , but the space is really cute in a modern sort of shabby-chic way . the food speaks for itself , though , despite the tiny space . we feasted on fresh country bread with olive oil , a refreshing salad of mesclun , diced prosciutto , and parmesan , an earthy , rich lasagna bolognese , and ricotta and spinach ravioli . everything was fantastic , and our meal was less than N . the rest of the menu looked great , too . i ' d kill for a place like this in dc . piccolo cafe absolutely hits the mark on take-out food done well . 
i ' m not easily impressed , but this place is amazing . i was here last saturday and wanted a late lunch . it was crowded , but my and and i were able to find a seat at one of the counters , had an awesome glass of sangiovese and some divine italian appetizers . if you have never been here , i recommend that you walk around the entire place before deciding where to eat . various sections have different offerings . and there is even a beer garden on the rooftop . there also are various markets on the floor for meats , breads , cheeses , etc . eatily is a feast for the senses . foodies take note ! 
i just " discovered " bitars after trying out some stuffed grape leaves of theirs at an art opening a while back and was sold . bitars serves up yummy greek meditteranean food at very cheap prices . the chicken kabob sandwich is my favorite and the hummus allllllmost tastes like my favorite hummus from a place called kassab ' s back when i lived in pittsburgh . believe me , i have been searching far and wide for hummus that tasty since i moved here and bitar ' s is a great substitute . my only complaint is that they tend to mess up orders , so if you get take out be sure to check your order before you leave the restaurant . 
i ' m not a fan of mayo so i was really hesitant to try their lobster roll - but it ' s what their known for ! after talking to the cashier and staring at the menu for other options - i decided ' you know what ? ! i don ' t know when i ' ll be back here so screw it ! i can always get something else if i don ' t like it ' i mean - N is a lot for a lobster roll - i wanted to make sure i was going to like it ! well . . it was delicious ! the mayo light and you can barely taste it - score ! it comes on white bread and is amazing ! it ' s not as big as the photos make it to be though so we decided to share it . but we easily could ' ve each had our own ! were so hungry that we ordered the lobster mac n cheese too ! sadly this didn ' t deliver as much as the lobster roll did - it barely had pieces chunks of lobster in it ( so glad i got to try this place - i ' ll definitely be back when i ' m in the area again ! i ' d love to come during happy hour - their hh deals are pretty affordable ! 
was looking online for a place to meet friends for early lunch , they from denver , via teaneck , we from smithtown . i found the listing and reviews for this sounded- too- good- to -be -true but it was worth the try gem . we were totally delighted with our food and the service . since we got there at N a . m . , we " owned " the place for the first N minutes before they got busy . once the room filled up the noise level was a little intense , but by that time we were almost ready to leave . iguess it ' s best t o get there early , as we did , or at the end of the service when the crowd has gone . the worst part was having to make a decision from the appealing choices on the menu . will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes . 
love this place . desserts are a little on the small side considering the prices . drinks and ambiance are fantastic . great place for conversation for business or with friends . also owned by the same group that opened the ace hotel two blocks up . service is unmatched for the area . truly fantastic . date rating N pick up scale N strong suggestion don ' t come hungry . 
best dam burger i ever had ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! shared it with two other people and was still full and its only N bucks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
if you like sausage , beer , pretzels with cheese and so forth , this is the place . the pakwurst is my favorite but others are fine as well . the pickles and peppers side is great , very hot and tasty . there is a veggie sausage that ' s good if you don ' t eat meat . nice beer selection . i don ' t have anything bad to say about der kom . 
always a big fan of their football sized burritos . salsa is awesome and a great appetizer while you wait for your food . look past the appearance and discover some solid mexican fare . 
excellent fresh pasta , meats and cheeses for sale that i have only found in italy . brought me right back to my visit to italy N christmases ago . i am never one to repeat anything i do when i am visiting nyc - but i will definitely go back here over and over again . 
this is probably some of the best higher end pizza i ' ve had in a long time . my friend and i split a duck hunt and a banana boat pizza . both were really amazing . there is not much more that i can do to elaborate , its a very subjective experience . but really good stuff . normally i would just give this place a N for the food , but some things were a bit off . we waited for almost N hours . not bad , i do understand that the place is popular . we waited in the bar area and ended up spending a lot on drinks . again , not the worst thing in the world . the problem is that they then try to squeeze you into the communal tables and you may end up sitting next to someone who is either sloshed , or you are sloshed yourself sitting next to someone that isn ' t . plus i have all kind of issues with personal space when eating . we also didn ' t care much for the wine we had , but i don ' t think that ' s the restaurant ' s fault . 
first time there this weekend to celebrate a birthday , and a great experience . the staff was friendly , and the menu is really vast , a little bit of something for everyone . i recommend the hot antipasto appetizer which gives a really big sampling of a few specialties on the appetizer menu . it was more than enough for two people to share , and so tasty . everything was perfectly done , quaint , just a great place in general . i will definitely go again . 
best . soup . dumplings . ever . seriously , these are delicious . we went after a concert down at pier N -- and , even at N N pm , the place was rockin ' . we got the sweet and sour shrimp ( or some prawn dish ) that was really tasty , and N orders of pork soup dumplings . be sure to follow soup-dumpling technique put the soup dumpling on your spoon , pierce with chopsticks , slurp out liquid , add in sauce in the opening-- and down the hatch they go ! 
my family and i have been frequenting baja ' s for years now and i can ' t say that we ' ve ever left disappointed . they don ' t necessarily have the most extensive tequila selection which is probably the only negative aspect of the entire dining experience , and is a fact i can certainly overlook . they have a salsa bar which is highly original . it has six different salsa selections , ranging from very mild to quite spicy , so there is an option for everyone . the nachos are always delicious , topped with pico de gallo , cheese , and guacamole . the chile relleno comes with two stuffed poblano peppers , beans , rice , and guacamole . it ' s a huge portion and more than likely you ' ll be taking some to go . all in all i ' ve been very pleased with baja ' s over the years and look forward to frequently returning with my family
went for brunch . we had crab toast , french toast and an asparagus and goat cheese omelette . doesn ' t sound very special , but everything tasted amazing ! ! ! also had a bloody mary that was nice and spicy . 
seafood are not that fresh . dinner portion is too large . they need to reduce the amount of food and improve quality instead . 
we had the shabu shabu and it was really good . good quality meats and vegetables . sauces were good . i would order appetizers because the portions are on the smaller side , especially the meats for the soup . would go back . 
rude staff . dirty dishes . for a vegetarian buffet , go up the road to mylai masala . for a much better non vegetarian buffet -- and courteous staff -- go to tandoori bite in princeton . you won ' t regret it . 
the waitress was extremely rude during a dinner of almost N people . i tried ordering a drink , forgot my id , so my classmate ordered me one . i clearly knew which drink i was ordered as if was a glass of wine and should not have been carded . the waitress literally grabbed a drink out of my hand and almost spilled it on me . very ride and unclassy . i am not sure how they allow to waiter people like these . and moreover , i ordered french fries and they tasted dry . honestly , there are lots of places much better than this in nyc . this one deserves only one star for cool decor . 
i would probably give the smith four stars just for replacing pizzeria uno on third ave . fortunately , that ' s not necessary -- it has earned a four-star review on its own merits . while busy for sunday brunch , we were seated quickly and service was friendly and speedy for the entire meal . the croaker , a croque madame served open-face in a skillet-shaped dish , was one of the best plates i ' ve had in months , and that includes a weekend in new orleans . one bloody mary or mimosa is included in the reasonable price . the bathrooms are really cool . they ' re stall-style with a unisex sink area . we actually all commented on the old-fashioned washbasin fixturing . on the minus side , beware the noise level . there ' s nary a sound-absorbing surface in the place , and it ' s really , really loud at peak brunch time . but that won ' t keep me away . 
the new york food scene has always been a little bit about pilgrimage and vision . and while glasserie might be somewhat off the beaten path it ' s worth the trip to this emerging brooklyn neighborhood . reminder , it was not so long ago that dumbo and williamsburg were considered out of the way . now on to glasserie . . . . flew in from la and went for dinner on a friday night . the place was packed , the atmosphere a lovely blend of candle lit chic industrial , the soundtrack wonderful hip and moody . the service was good , servers and bussers mostly attentive . the food was delicious ! cocktails even better . i prefer small plates intended to be shared it ' s the best way to taste the range of the menu . definitely order the flat bread , labneh , tahini , and the cauliflower dishes . i ' m not a lover of lamb but the lamb croquettes are a must have . all in all love this place . 
burrito box is the best burrito place in nyc . blows dos toros and chipotle out of the water . the daily specials of carnitas , the western and chicken with salsa verde are both original and delicious . i only wish my waistline could afford to eat their burritos more often . maybe i should train for a marathon just to have it daily . barron r . ' s point about the price is simply unfounded . it is N . N for a grilled chicken burrito as compared to N . N for a chipotle chicken burrito . for . N cents you get tons of white meat chicken ( unlike the portioned dark meat garbage chipotle slops together ) , great chips and some of the best salsa ' s i ' ve ever had . 
i ever so often have a taste for a good ' ol italian sauage sandwich from rocco ' s when today i realized im going to have to find a new place to get my tasty favorite . i went to roccos to try out a steak iiwalked in today and if any body that goes to roccos knows that they always give out free samples practicly stuffing them down your throat to promote sales which i love . today was different i was the second patron in line and as i stood multiple people walked in and were offered samples i dindt pay much attention to the fact until more people coming in after me were offered and i wasnt . i stood and watched the gentleman cut and skewer samples and i was not offered one yet might i note the he looked me dead in the eyes N times i recieved my steak sandwich that i ordered . and i asked the lead guy in charge " i wasnt offered a sample at all ? ' and he replies and says to me " he was busy uh uh i mean we ' re busy " ? would you like a sample now " . wow i was mortified . ive been here on several occasions in the past and i know how its supposed to be ran . most of all i was hurt to walk in a place of business and to see every one be served but yourself was terrible . i finnally took my sandwich and left the might i ad the person in charge asked me what i wanted on it N times and he still messed up my order which was cool with me . then i get my food the bread was soggy the the meat was not even cooked all the way it dripped every were at that point i just wrapped it back up and sat it on there counter i didnt even ask for my money back . at the end of the day i know knowone cares but ill never set a foot in that place again unless its to teach the employees how to treat people now matter what they look like with respect and decency . i won the lottery and i was going to buy my N employees lunch from roccos to celibrate i know a few thousand buck is nothing nowadays but i wanted to spend it at roccos now i cant because i wasnt important enough . 
my favorite billyburg staple for carryout after work . great food , good service , a bathroom would be nice . . . but for a N falafel sandwich , i ' ll deal . 
i went to cafe gitane for sunday brunch after reading the reviews on yelp and was thoroughly disappointed . i ordered the baked eggs and they were so overcooked they turned black on the surface . wouldn ' t recommend cafe gitane with the plethora of wonderful cafes around the neighbourhood . 
amo essere coccolata . . soprattutto quando viaggio , ho mangiato benissimo e da buona italiana , lo consiglio vivamente . e anche se siamo arrivati a chiusura cucina sono stati molto gentili e disponibili . . ottimo vino . si pu cenare anche su un bellissimo tavolo all ' americana . . assolutamente consigliato . 
classic burger , bacon , cheese , fries and a brew . they have the ambience of a closet , but the burger is a sullen gift amidst the high strung crowds that flock to wait on a line for a good portion of an evening to see the main show a bistro burger . when i first came here , the long haired hippies and locals ruled supreme . now , we get loafers , north face jackets and fake highlights to stare at while we wait for that perfect table and perfect burger . sometimes i ' m not in the mood , but more often than not , the burger condemns those thoughts hastily . 
i have been coming here for years and the food is always wonderful , service is excellent , and the atmosphere is good too . the food is always readily available and they will ask you if you want to try something on the menu that hasn ' t been brought out to you yet . servers pull your chairs and treat you like royalty ! even when it ' s full there is never a long wait if you didn ' t have the chance to make reservations . 
the " first pizza " was pretty good . my buddies didn ' t think it was worth the hype but i enjoyed my pie . i went with ricotta , olives and prosciutto . don ' t forget it ' s cash only and you will wait about N minutes for a seat . . . have a beer or N at the bar while you wait . 
good bagels , but they only have a N-slice toaster so it takes forever for a toasted bagel ! ! i usually have to call in my order for pick up ! 
excellent , thats all i can say especially the sicilians ! 
very friendly environment , my favorite dish is the shrimp parm sandwich , pizzas are very tasty and cheesy , they make sure the customers are happy , if you want something off the menu , if they can , they make it ) will deff be going there again to eat
gotta have da burger juicy and perfectly cooked good bun also
loved it ! ! 
this place has been on all of my friends tounges me being from nola i was like let ' s go check it out . . went in there sunday night and the guy at the cash register greeted us with a hello , smile , and eye contact which is different i figured this would be a typical hipster hole like the rude clientele that was there that nite . i suggest sitting in the back the front is a bit chaotic and well if you been to williamsbug you know the type of people who live there enough said . anyway we had the crispy juicy fried chicken with a zucchini tomato stew yummy my friend had a chicken biscuit the butter on that thing will put about ten pounds on ya for just looking at it . it ' s a bit much i think ! our waitress was helpful and sweet the music was on point and the keylime and peach cobbler made remember my grandma . see you there ! 
good food , good people , . . been going there ever since i was a kid and i still love it
yum , would def go back here again . the sangria blanca was delicious ! plus , it was served in a gigantic glass . my friend ordered the baby back ribs , which were amazing , especially with the mexican corn and sweet potato fries , mm still thinking about the food . my bistec was really good , i substituted the tomato watercress salad with spinach , which the waiter suggested , and everything was delicious ! want to come back here for brunch and try that with the unlimited sangria now ) 
love the food and environment . i feel like i am in cuba when going to eat . service can be slow due to large crowds but the food wit worth the wait . byob is great . 
junior ' s restaurant does have a wide variety of decent cheesecake . i have had better cheesecake , but theirs is okay . their food however , i was not impressed with . the hamburger i ordered lacked flavor . my wife ordered a fresh roasted turkey sandwich which came with a decent amount of meat but not much else . i will most likely not return to this restaurant , nor would i recommend it . 
i ' ve been to rome three times , florence and venice twice , and naples once . my advice save all the money you would have wasted at eataly , and buy yourself a plane ticket to the real thing . the inflated prices , the stand up and eat tables ( who eats like a nyc commuter in relaxed italy ? ) , the jarring american accents of the servers and the selection of mostly american-grown fruits and vegetables are not worth the price of admission to this tourist trap . call me a snob , but the minute i read the gelato sign that assured me that the fresh milk for the ice cream was imported direct from exotic rochester , ny , you lost me , eataly . and when i tasted it , it was ok , but nothing like the gelato i had near the trevi fountain . it ' s not eataly ' s fault that they can ' t realistically import all the fruits , vegetables and fresh meat from italy . but to charge premium prices for american-bred produce and meat is ridiculous . italian veggies are far superior in taste to american foodstuffs , what with it being bioengineered ( despite labels saying the contrary ) . except for the imports , why pay more ? furthermore , nyers have so much good italian fare to choose from , why would they come here ? i ' d rather have a delicious sit down dinner in little italy in manhattan , arthur avenue in the bronx , or staten island . eataly seems geared toward the pretentious yuppie under manhattan house arrest who just wants a italian version of zabar ' s . those who want the status symbol of having paid premium prices for what is rather ordinary italian food should shop here . all others , grab your euros and get on alitalia . 
great spot . dumplings and a sesame pancake for N . N . throw in a hot and sour soup and you ' ve got lunch for breakfast at N N in the morning . beats a whole lotta other stuff . 
the sangrias are superb . there are a bunch of different kinds . i liked the havana banana one a lot . sunday brunch was an experience . they are very busy which means the service isn ' t very prompt , but it ' s definitely worth it to come here at least once in your lifetime . the salmon crepes were ok , wouldn ' t get it again and it was a small portion , but the steak is delicious . it ' s tender as if it ' s been slow cooked , and flavorful at the same time . 
if you ' ve ever attended high school in hamden , then you have been to acropolis , known to everyone as " a-crop " . sure , the food isn ' t the best , but it is the best place to eat when it ' s two in the morning and there ' s nothing left to do . they serve everything at all hours , so you can get pancakes with a side of mashed potatoes or a steak with a side of bacon . there used to be a waitress there named xue who was probably the favorite out of everyone i know , but they fired her . i will always miss her chant-like " need moar water ? ! " . some people may call it a-crap , because the food isn ' t the best , but it certainly fills you up . if you need a place to go , go to acrop . 
i love pie n thighs ! i moved away from nyc and i keep trying to find a biscuits and gravy that compares to the rob evans on a biscuit . yummy ! 
it is hard not to be a fan of this place if you like asian fusion food . the atmosphere is excellent , the service is great , and the food is as good as it gets . however , it is really expensive ( for me , at least ) . save this place for special occasions , it is worth it ! 
went here for the first time last night after hearing some good things . i have to say , i can ' t agree more with the positive feedback . we started with the mozzarella and roasted peppers . the cheese was perfectly salted and dressed . the fresh pasta , we both ordered for dinner was perfect . i had the tagliatelle with artichoke hearts and a light tomato cream sauce . it was perfect . the pasta was fresh , cooked perfectly , and delicate . the sauce was not too heavy . my wife had the tagliatelle with the pesto sauce . also delicious . overall very impressive . the other huge thing about this place , its really really reasonably price . almost all dishes in the N- N range . we ' ll be back . 
service with a smile . friendly wait staff . clean restaurant . warm atmosphere . i ordered coffee with was very good . i was waiting for my friend who was on his way . i sat at the bar and felt comfortable sitting there while waiting . i took a few photos to keep me entertained while waiting . i got in a little after Nam so i missed breakfast . but i have been told that the frittata was a good option , which came with ( asparagus , tomatoes , grana padano ) i ' d come back for breakfast next time . 
i am a big fan of this place . it has excellent food , friendly service , and a comfortable ambience . my friends and i ordered approximately N yakitori skewers for dinner , some sides ( like tempura ) , and also a bowl of ramen . everything was delicious . the skewers were cooked very well , and the ramen was rich and filling . if it weren ' t for tragic limitations of the human anatomy , i might have ordered another N skewers . instead , i decided to be reasonable and ordered around N more . and i enjoyed every bite . my favorite yakitori skewers are the ribeye , liver , pork belly , chicken skin , and chicken with green onions . my least favorite one may have been the chicken gizzard , although i attribute that more to my unfamiliarity with the ingredient rather than to any problems on their end . our waiter was friendly and we loved him . he was very attentive ( i am relatively sure that his name was johnny ) and may very well have been one of the best servers i have encountered in my life thus far . so if you come here , ask for johnny . he ' s chill . i will say that it can definitely get crowded at certain times , but a reservation a day or two in advance should prevent that from becoming an issue . also , if you are like me and have no self-control , beware those skewers can really add up on your check . in conclusion try this place . i doubt you will be disappointed . 
food came out quickly , wait staff was great , food was perfection . not to mention that the price is hard to beat in nyc . 
this is a review of the pizza at starlite since i have not had any other dish there . i first came to starlit a few months back at the advice of family for a very delicious thin crust pizza . the pizza was delicious and cooked beautifully . however , the next time i went back it was decent and steered me to another pizzeria in town . a few weeks back , again at my parents ' s place , we had a delicious pie and found out that it was starlite . the bonus was that we really love green olives on our pies and starlite has them available . needless to say that starlite has been back on the menu since and the suggestion is always welcomed with a smile . if you ' ve never tried , the green olives and onion is a great combo . 
would have N-stars if there was a dining room . the pizza was perfect , but there were only N-stools and a bar to eat at . the pizza was ready , added any toppings and touched up in the oven . i need to go back . best plan for this place is take out or pickup at the window and go back to broadway and sit on a bench to eat it . 
place is okay . the food is great but not something i wouldn ' t be able to find somewhere else . it is cheap so i guess that ' s a plus . it is way too hot in the place , i think they need to be mindful of the guests and turn on some ac , i do not want to be dripping in sweat while i am trying to eat my food . super small place , but if they handle that ac problem then i think it will be better . 
good food , really friendly service and chill vibe . i like to pop in whenever im in the area for a vegan scramble . 
horrible , rude owner . kicked us out because we were having " too much fun . " no other legitimate reason provided . unless it was discrimination or racism . she probably thought i was drunk , dancing and acting free and crazy , but guess what , i was so sober i could remember every single detail . and i only had one beer . i have never encountered an owner so disrespectful , now i understand why the place was literally empty and dead on st . patty ' s weekend . i am a manager of a company and guess what , i am going to tell my staff and peers to not step foot on nick ' s . thank you for the business . 
a solid all-around sushi restaurant that also has great chinese food . great place to casually have a meal with friends . 
we had more enjoyable times at this restaurant than bad ones , so all in all a thumbs-up . the wait staff is very helpful and professional . the place can get really busy but the staff still tries really hard . the food is in general good although a bit pricey . 
really amazing food . low key and chill atmosphere fo brunch . the host was really nice . i can ' t wait to go back . 
honest tom ' s a small little taco shop that recently opened on Nth street . there menu is small and simple . they have tacos and burritos as the entrees . then , you can get chips with guac or salsa and rice and beans as sides . the main choices for tacos and burritos are chicken , pork , carnitas ( beef ) , and sweet potato . and , for tacos you can also get fish tacos , which are tilapia . they also have a breakfast tacos and burritos on their menu . i ordered N fish tacos and a chicken taco , and got some chips and guac on the side . it was all very fresh and tasted good . the tacos , while good , did not blow me away . something about it was borderline authentic , almost like an american copy cat . it was a bit too clean . i think there was cheese on it , but didn ' t really notice , possibly because it was not , or maybe because there was not enough . personally , i prefer my tacos with a little sloppy with lots stuff on it . but don ' t get me wrong , these do taste good . the tilapia , chicken , and sweet potato ( my wife had ) were all fresh and tasted good . next time , i want to give the burrito a try . i saw someone eating one and it looked like a monster , in a good way . the chips were awesome . i could tell they were freshly made on site . the guac was pretty good . the salsa was a little disappointing . i was mostly chopped tomatoes and onions , which i would have called pico de gallo . salsa , imo , is more of a saucy texture and has more seasoning and kick to it . all in all , not a bad place , but there is room to improve . 
if you come here for breakfast . three words . big boy breakfast ! for N buckaroos you can get a variety of dishes that will sure you make you full . my eyes are always bigger than my stomach . my big boy breakfast included standard scrambled eggs potatoes turkey sausages french toast each of the portion are huge and full orders of each , not just mini side orders . service was lovely . the food came out not too long after we ordered . the restaurant has a fancy and interesting kind of interior design . super clean . it is in a downtown district so transportation is not an issue . you can either take the train ( the train station is about a half a block away . after , you walk off your big boy breakfast by frolicking around the district . there are cute little shops from N-N block radius . 
the ramen tastes exactly like how i used to start my college essays , like " a dream opened up by the coldness of murder " . i ' ve been here N times every time , it disappoints me even more . first off , the hirata buns are no joke ! i ' ve never had chasiu that delicious . i ' ve also never paid N for two pieces of chasiu before . i don ' t think i can see myself in the paying that much for chasiu any time soon . the real problem was in the ramen , you know , the main thing they sell . i don ' t mind the waiting , that ' s a given and i live in nyc . what i do mind however , is waiting an hour on average for the most abundantly watered down ramen i ' ve ever had . for a place that ' s so hyped , i was kind of offended having paid more than average for tasteless noodles . maybe tasteless is the wrong word . it was like slightly flavored water . . . very slight . also very sad . i ' ll give them the small benefit that it was right when they opened . . . but stiiiiiiiiiiiiill . 
no halal cart is good enough after this halal cart ! my friend eric made me stand in this very very long line that moved surprisingly fast . . after trying it i understand completely ! don ' t be intimidated by the line , trust me . it moves fast and the reward at the front is totally worth it ! 
i decided to order delivery from wasabi and was not disappointed ! the sushi was fresh and yummy , and the pad thai was delish ( i loved that they kept the pecans and basil separate from the food and i could add the quantity i wanted myself ) 
dined here recently and had the steak sandwich and fries which tasted very good . i walked by the restaurant early this morning and much to my disgust i observed a delivery of boxes of " simplot clearly crisp fries . " these are the exact same chemically coated fries that wendy ' s uses in their " naturally cut " sea salt fries . one of the nasty chemicals in these fries is disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate , which is added to prevent the fries from browning in hot oil . if they use this crap for their fries , it makes me wonder about everything else on their menu . 
pancakes the best i have ever had and the great reviews on yelp reflect this . service unacceptable and rude . . . most of the negative reviews seem to reflect this too . after hearing many good things about this place i decided to give it a try . my mom saw bobby flay ' s show that featured clinton street and wanted to go too . so as not to have to wait , we picked a monday night . walked in and was seated right away . order was taken and food arrived shortly after . food was excellent . in fact , the pancakes were so good that we decided to order another stack . i got the attention of the waitress and told her that we wanted anther order of the pancakes . so my mom stops eating the stack we were sharing and waits for her order of pancakes to come out . after about N mins of waiting the waitress comes to our table and asks us if she can get us anything else ! ! i ' m like where are the pancakes we ordered ? ? ? waitress somehow misunderstood that we wanted an additional order . ok , misunderstandings happen . . . everyone is human . people make mistakes . . . but when i told her we wanted another order of pancakes she was very short with me . . . i was not sure she heard as she was not really responding and so i told her again explicitly that in addition to what what we have ordered we would like another order of the pancakes . but she evidently was not paying attention , even the second time i told her . . . because she was oblivious after . place was not even packed or that busy . so i just told her to forget it and asked for a check . so like i said , i would not hold this mistake against her or the restaurant . . . but i found it incredibly rude that she did not even have the decency to apologize . this i do hold against her . she did not even explain to us that she misunderstood . . . just walked away . after all my mom ended up waiting N mins and then eating the rest of my cold pancakes . as much as i loved the pancakes , i hate rude people and shitty service . happy to pay N bucks for an order of amazing pancakes , but it is not really enjoyable to eat out at a place with poor service . that said , the busboy was amazing . . . every other min he was there with water . would have liked to give this place N stars , but probably won ' t return . i have read other reviews commenting on rude bad service , i wonder if owner is aware . 
miya ' s is not your traditional sushi restaurant in fact , i hardly remember anything from this place that is something japanese people would eat . goat cheese makes it into half of their dishes , and more often than not , cooked rather than raw fish end up on top of the rice . that being said , it is a new haven establishment and mixes very creative flavors into sushi . it is also a restaurant whose quality has varied significantly with time i loved it when i first came to nh in N , and then the management gradually increased their prices ( some dishes by N to N percent ) and introduced very weird ( for me ) ingredients , such as fried cicadas , which made it less appealing . there were times when my partner and i would have to spend around N dollars there to feel satisfied . recently , however , the prices have been reduced and the quality gone up . their sweet potato roll is worth a try , and both the kraken ( made with peppers and squid ) and the geisha boy are really flavorful . i also like their cocktails , and they have a happy hour usually at the end of the day when they offer five pieces of sushi for five dollars . can ' t beat that ! 
the seafood was alright , obviously not as fresh as it could ultimately be . overall , after eating here twice the service was excellent . very kind , and attentive to our needs and desires . i may or may not go here again with a big gathering of people , being that it was very pricy . 
this is my first review as a yelper . i decided to review my favorite restaurant in nj . my wife and kids and i have been here at least N times and have never had a bad meal . in fact it has always been excellent . i have been to many thai restaurants both in nj and nyc . this small place where the husband ( iggy ) takes orders and the wife cooks up the most delicious food ever is the best thai i have had . the pad thai is excellent . the shrimp and garlic lover is amazing . the coconut soup and the hot and spicy soup will leave you wanting more . my kids love the spicy fried rice . the prices are very reasonable . we have never spent more than N . N which usually includes N-N apps , N-N entrees , soft drinks ( the thai iced tea is so refreshing ) tax and tip . it is byob for those who care . 
my favorite restaurant in new york . i recommend it to everyone . from the sandwiches to the sangria to the service - this place is awesome . definitely recommend all of the patacons and arepas , and always always always get the sangria . also the price can not be beat and the atmosphere is adorable - a great place to kick it with friends or on a date . 
this place is fantastic ! great food , great service at great prices ! 
i will give this place one more try but the potato in my dose was cold . maybe baldev should stick with amans in norristown . i am always disappointed when north indians try to make a dosa
best sushi in the state . without question . fresh fish . carefully prepared . 
do you love ketchup ? you " ll love the pasta sauce . maybe the worst italian food i ever had . learn from my mistake , dont go to bella napoli . 
i ' m so confused by a lot of these reviews . this is not a N star restaurant and they don ' t pretend to be . firehouse is a bar pub style eatery . you go to firehouse for good wings , reuben sandwiches , ribs , fried shrimp , onion rings and burgers . yes , they have other things on the menu , but you ' re not buying a N fillet mignon when you order a steak , so you get what you pay for . they have a full bar , tv ' s , a very nice staff , clean place , full bar with good drinks . it ' s a great place for an after work or lunch time alcoholic beverage with a quick , hot , fresh meal or bar snacks . i give it N stars in comparison to a lot of other pub bars i know of like the jolly trolley in westfield - firehouse is way above them . i wish they had a few other classic dinner items on the menu like meatloaf , and some modern appetizers like fried calamari with thai chili dipping sauce or mini egg rolls ( who doesn ' t like asian fushion finger foods ? ) - maybe the owner will read this and add some of my suggestions ! 
my review is just based on brunch alone . we went here because the wait at sabrinas was ridiculous as usual on a weekend . we were not greeted right away . we were also told we had to sit at some awkward table in the corner , which was fine , but clearly they were understaffed . the bar tender was also our server , so the service was insanely slow . i do not blame that our server obviously but he was not even friendly . i do not understand all of the hype over the brunch here . yes , the bottomless bloodys and mimosas are a great deal . . and they taste good . . but the food was not great at all . the service was not good and the food was not great , so i will not be returning . there are way better brunch places in the fairmount neighborhood that i would go to over here . 
this review is mostly for coffee brunch . the food and pastries are amazing and the coffee is very good . i like the sitting outside and inside options . i like people watching here . my dislikes are - i find the staff to always seem harried even though there is usually just as many staff as there are customers . they also seem too harried to be friendly or relaxed . it is sort of an anxious atmosphere . they all seem very interesting or artistic in some way which is cool , but there is a gulf between them and the customers which i find odd since this is largely a coffee shop as well as a restaurant . i always feel like i need to get out of there quickly instead of it feeling inviting or relaxing . one other comment , i had dinner here once and ordered steak , they refused to do it any other way then medium rare . steak is expensive and if you ' re craving it , you should have it cooked the way you like . again , pastries and coffee really good , and worth the hassle sometimes . 
after enough times dining out , you learn to recognize good omens . for instance , if you are at one of your favorite restaurants for lunch and you tell the manager ( who you are friendly with ) that you are going to xxxx for dinner and he goes " oh damn , that place rules " . this would qualify as a good omen . what about when a restaurant puts pork N ways on a plate ? personally , i feel like bacon on something is cheating a bit . now , top that same suckling pig with bacon and chicharr n and you ' ve got me . another good omen . enter la calaca feliz , the dinner prefaced by wonderful omens and was equally as delicious in reality . i want to say that this place has one of the coolest interiors i have ever seen . the walls are glowing with an awesome floral and mexican mural while the high ceilings and large window just make this place feel so open and light even when it ' s dark outside . foodwise , i was floored . the meatballs stuffed with fresh cheese and cooked to mouth-watering perfect were just enough to get me ready for the fish tacos and the aforementioned pig N ways on a plate . the fish tacos were fried , a style i ' m not normally a fan of but i ' ve become a believer . they had perfect body and the radish and cabbage tossed with some lemon juice cut through the richness for a perfectly rounded flavor . the pig N ways , well , i ' ll let your imagination fill in those details . honestly , this place is a serious winner . fairmount is one of my lesser traveled sections of philly but now i ' ve got a damn fine reason to come back . 
i live in downtown hartford and was sick of getting domino ' s delivery everytime i wanted pizza . my friend , who is a hartford native , suggested i try this place out . the pizza i got was the chicken pesto . it was a bit on the pricey side , but it did include " premium " toppings so i let it slide . the pizza came very quickly , less than N minutes . the pizza presentation was actually quite impressive . whoever made it spent a lot of time making sure toppings were evenly distributed across the pie . as far as the pizza itself is concerned , it wasnt bad , but it wasnt amazing . i would have preferred there to be a bit more sauce . the pizza thickness was good , but there just wasnt enough sauce for the amount of crust . the toppings were good , but the pieces of chicken were almost so small you almost forgot they were there . the veggie toppings were good , including the fresh garlic . bottom line , its a lot better than dominos , and with a better selection , but i ' m not convinced its the best option for hartford delivery . i will try a few more places , but will always keep this in mind as an option . 
the spotted pig is the first place where i tried chicken liver toast ! didn ' t sound too appetizing , nor am i an organ eater , but i must say that the toast was worth trying ! ! ! paired with a chilled vodka , oh what a great lunch ! ) 
ok . philadelphia needs a place like this every few blocks . now this is proper breakfast ! ! ! ! ! kick marathon to the curb and come here ! 
had lunch this afternoon . very busy and noisy . we ( N ) ate outside which was much quieter . we enjoyed our choices baked clams , grilled octopus , veal milanese , chicken wrap . keylime pie . nutella wontons . service was very slow almost N N N hours for our entree . i will return to give it a try again . 
it ' s the best pizza in the neighborhood and reasonably priced . 
i have been going here for lunch for several years , and in the past , everything was great . however , in the last week or two it seems like quality has really gone down hill ! last week , there was almost nothing on my sandwich . this week , my panini wasn ' t even warm and the bread was all soggy . N- N is way too much to spend on a sandwich you end up throwing away . don ' t think i will be back for a while . 
awesome addition to the neighborhood . if you haven ' t had the kimchi taco truck yet , go chase it down now or , well , just come to kimchi grill . the small menu has essentially N dishes with N proteins , but don ' t be fooled into thinking they ' ll be the same dish . the tacos especially are completely different depending on what the main protein is . the chicken is also prepared differently in the tacos the other stuff . so far , my hands down favorite is the short rib bowl with fried rice - although i ' d probably order highly recommend the multi-grain brown rice . the tacos are great , and really loaded up , but go ahead over-order . all the sauces and veggies are really tasty , you pretty much can ' t go wrong . i do sort of wish that their fried rice was the same as the truck rice , but hey . . . that still gives me an excuse to gorge on street corners from time to time . cash only , closed mondays ! 
all communal tables . called to see if there was room for two on a sat night . " sure " . hike over and the place is like a closet with three tiny tables . " just want u to know , that all tables are communal " . why not tell me when i called in the first place ? walked out . 
authentic nepali food with live music . must haves - choila , sekuwa . the momos are good too . the music is bollywood plus nepali . all in all a grea evening guaranteed . 
i love xlb anyway . but , i brought my mom here . she liked it . when ya momma likes it , ya gotta love it ! ) my memory is fuzzy , but don ' t you have to share seats with people ? if so , how very " authentic . " 
wonderful atmosphere and super friendly staff . great place for drinks ! didn ' t like the food at all though , but the manager replaced our food and did everything in his power to keep us happy . sorry to say i didn ' t like the other dish either , but the wine was good . 
i went to carmines a few months back and i must say i enjoyed every minute of it . i reserved a table through yelp for a late night after noon . carmine has received very good reviews from my many of my associates . i was running a bit late and called the front desk to advise them , they responded very well and had no problem . i was told that it would be okay to come in even if i was late which i greatly appreciated . once we arrived we were welcomed and seated very quickly . the atmosphere was great as well as our hostess , she was pleasant , not rude or obnoxious , made sure everything was great . i ordered the seafood pasta the family style portions were enough for just two which i loved . the pasta was different and to die for . i would recommend this place to anyone with group of friends or even someone special . 
i ' ve been here on a number of occasions . i highly reccomend going when the weather is nice so you can sit outside - beautiful . the food has always been above average - all the reviews can tell you that . i think the food at arunee is just as good , if not better at times though . if sripraphai gets busy though ( which it does often because everyone in manhattan is braving the N train to get here ) , watch out for your service . sometimes it felt like my dining companion and i were not even there . we ' d have to flag down the water-guy to get some attention . arunee over in neighboring jackson heights has incredible service and i venture to say a bolder menu to boot . for most folks ( including me ) , the options of various stomach meats is lost , but i ' d say it definitely matters to some . 
don ' t have enough money to fly to tokyo ? come here ! i was tokyo last year and i don ' t think i even found such a great place as cha-an . everything there is very authentic and de-licious ! and and and , you have to check out the woman ' s bathroom . . . automatic toilet with the tushy washer ! the toilet seat even goes up and down at the push of a button ! so if your in much need of a pit stop in new york city and need a clean spot , i would suggest this place . of course , don ' t forget to try all their teas and food . their finger sandwiches are great and fresh ! please don ' t expect large potions of food , this is more of an afternoon tea places ) 
love the cellar at beechers ! ! luckily always landed up here during the happy hour ( and ended up staying well beyond it ) and the five dollar infused cocktials are just amazing . this time it was a basil lemon infused vodka and it was delicious . great ambience and service too
have been to both locations several times and i was very disappointed this time . i ' m not sure what is going on with the portion sizes , i know its tapas but come on ! btw N small women this is the meal we shared . a very delicious large pitcher of red sangria ( ? ) . the pinchos de pulpo were N . N and there were N pinchos with one slice of octopus each the rest was filler . the camarones alajio were the N sad little shrimp swimming in oil - N . N . i have bigger shrimp in my freezer . pan con tomate was the most substantial tapa - N . N . there was a great artichoke salad special that was very good and appropriately sized ( ? ) . but after N tapas and a pitcher of sangria . . . still starving . we had to order an additional main plate of fideos ( soup noodles with seafood ) , which our waitress said had lots of nice seafood in it . N small muscles , N small clams , and a few calamari rings . it was really quite a sad dish N . N . N later , very eh . i had no interest in ordering any of the desserts with the likely hood of it being nothing but a tease . oh and all the tapas came within five minutes of ordering . on the plus side everything tasted great but just not enough substance . 
the spinach pie is amazing . . . if you can get there to get it before it is sold out . that is my only complaint is that there is never enough ( 
it was ok good for a quick lunch but nothing to rant and rave about . 
we celebrated my husbands Nth birthday . the staff was great and food was delicious . i would absolutely go there again
good chicken and waffles
this place is the shining pearl in the oyster of the upper east side . let me start by saying i never thought i would enjoy living on the ues . my husband and i have lived downtown for years and the main component that kept us there was being surrounded by fantastic places to eat and hang out that were forever incomparable to uptown spots . that has all changed because of writing room and many surrounding hot spots . we have come here several times since it has opened and every time it really is better than previous . . . if even possible . the food is outta this world between the ribs . . . tuna . . . the fried chicken . . . oh me oh my . . . the cavatelli . . . . or this undeniably tastetastic corn soup ! omg ! i have not tried any of their recent cocktails but my husband loves the beer selection moreover the wine list is fantastic and offers something for everyone we always split a bottle of whatever is suggested for the night ' s meal . that being said the staff is very knowledgeable of wine pairings and the managers floating around are a great help . not sure if she is one of the owners but carolyn is always there to welcome us or swing by our table dressed like a movie star and accessorized with a smile lots of laughs in addition to making you feel like she is entertaining you in her own dining room which is very pleasant and unique when comparing to other restaurants that are waiting for you to get up as prompt urgent as possible ! make sure to ask for her as she will just put the cherry on top of your meal ! we have yet to come for brunch but have heard high remarks so will give it a try . save room for dessert if you had ever left without having a bite of funnel cake or rice pudding then you have some work to continue ! 
wow , i can ' t believe anyone dislikes this place . the neighborhood stinks , the restaurant is closed on random days , the hipster crowd is blas . . . but the burger--the burger is awesome . order a kobe burger medium rare and add harissa aioli and you ' ll be set . the fries are perfect too . in between steak fries and shoestring fries in size , they come out perfectly cooked and tasty . i can ' t speak for the shake ( yet ) , but i ' ll think about it for the next time . 
plain dirty . no water , no cleaning vegies , no washing hends . got diaria after eating falafel sandwich . ( 
i absolutely love this place ! i have come here a few times now , and there hasn ' t been one thing i didn ' t like . everything has been delicious and fresh ! the staff is always super friendly , and i love trying all the different dosas . they have so many ! my favorite is the pondicherry dosa ) today i went in to get a pondicherry dosa to go . while i waited ( which was not long ) , i had a sweet lassi . it was delicious ! very yummy on a hot day like today . will definitely be returning ) 
tuna stuffed jalapeno tempura ? yes , please ! on a recent visit back to philly a girlfriend told about this little gem . it ' s in my old neighborhood and just down the street from my all time favorite brunch spot - sabrina ' s - off Nth and callowhill . on the last evening of my visit , two friends and i dropped in for dinner with N bottles of wine in tow . immediately i liked the soothing , minimalist decor and hanging tea lights that dangled from the ceiling of this sleek little byo . we did not have reservations , but were seated promtly and it was pretty busy for a sunday night . between the three of us , we shared four sushi rolls , plus the stuffed jalapeno appetizer and spicy edamame . everything was great and the fish was fresh and tender . it ' s definitely a good addition to the restaurant scene and since many neighborhood sushi places are pretty small it ' s nice to have options , especially when the sushi cravings strike ! 
i came here with two friends , and we split a bunch of stuff . however , nothing really stuck out other than the bbq buns ( i am a sucker for pork belly ) and the octopus ( grilled , tender , and succulent ) . nothing was bad , and i remember that the dishes had a lot of good flavor . all of that would be fine if it was cheaper , but it was rather pricey ( i guess that ' s ny for you ! ) . drinks are good . i really liked the reverend palmer - bourbon , lemon syrup , and bitters . mmm . 
if you are ever stuck in traffic trying to get on the bqe at hamilton avenue , or if you have ever just had a particularly painful shopping experience due to poor customer service at home depot or loews on hamilton avenue ( as if the work that you plan to do with your purchases isn ' t punishment enough ) , and you begin to think that hamilton avenue is truly hell on earth , where all hellish traffic and shopping experiences await you . . . just drive N minutes and reward yourself with the best lobster roll in brooklyn . you will be confused how such a place of deliciousness and freshness can exist in such a barren wasteland of industrialism , but it does and you shouldn ' t miss it . reward yourself goddamn-it ! why rush home to paint or scrape the fence ? ? order a maine style lobster role and enjoy the big chunks of lobster , with just the small right amount of mayo on a buttery roll , sit on the picnic benches and pretend you ' re in maine by the beach . you deserve it , enjoy ! your sanity is worth N . fyi - there is no public restroom so if you were just stuck in traffic on the bqe , stop at the mcdonald ' s first . 
the look and feel of a soho restaurant . very cool space and knowledgeable staff . the food is very high end gourmet , and excellent in every way . the kind of presentation that is the hallmark of top tier eating . hamachi and cobia tartare , flavored with ginger and scallions was fantastic , as was the corn ravioli . great cocktails , but , as with all starr restaurants , very light on the wine pour . overall , expensive , but well worth it . 
andouille egg and cheese and a decent cup of coffee . under N . a worthy breakfast . consistently friendliest peeps in the rtm and good simple food . as silly as it sounds each time i ' m there i wanna book a trip to nola . . . 
both the eat in and take out stands are usually packed and with good reason . i ' ve only had their grilled chicken w rice and beans dish and corn . the chicken dish is really good and you usually get a generous portion . as for their corn . . . let ' s just say corn on the cob topped with butter , cheese , and spices a hot grill awesomeness . 
my wife and i ended up at this restaurant after having a bad experience at another iron bound eatery . that ' s correct , they should be all called eateries and not restaurants . while here , my wife ordered the chicken in garlic over linguine and i ordered the veal scaloppini over linguini . both plates when served came back over spaghetti . my wife was somewhat okay with her dish but my veal must have been deep fried because the edges were crispy and too chewy . the food was not worth what we paid . the service was mediocre and it ' s the last time they ' ll see us . i should have gone to the supermarket and made my own dinner . with the money we left there we could be eating gourmet at home all weekend long . 
i haven ' t eaten here yet , so this review is just for the service . i go to lic market a few times a week to sit and have coffee in the mornings before school . the staff is very friendly , someone is always there to refill my coffee without me asking , and i never feel rushed to leave even though i am only having coffee . also the soap in the bathroom smells amazing ) will have to try the food one of these days . 
this was our Nrd time at public in about a year and the place just seems to get better and better . to start , the space is just about perfect . especially in winter , the place is amazingly warm and inviting with all the candles and oil lamps setting off the brick and wood . also , unlike so many places in manhattan , although space is at a premium you don ' t feel like you are being shoehorned in here - there is space to get in and out of your table and space on the table to eat without playing musical dishes . although other reviewers have complained about the service , we have never found it wanting . the staff have invariably been cheerful , informed , and appropriately attentive . most importantly , the food is different , flavorful , well presented , and good . among the appetizers the grilled scallops , mushroom ceviche , and grilled kobe beef tongue are out favorites . interesting , but a little less our style was the grilled kobe beef tongue . the mains have yet to disappoint us although we do have some favorites the roast lamb sirloin , the new zealand venison loin , beet gnudi , and the pork belly and tenderloin . then there are the desserts , which just seem to be getting better every time we go - combining strong , interesting flavors with artistic platings . unfortunately , with fresh figs out of the market , the fig bar that we have so enjoyed if off the menu , but it has been replaced a spiced apple cobbler that is served with caramelized popcorn and the most amazing cranberry-rosemary sorbet . speaking of the sorbets , although this is maybe not the best time of year their sorbet sampler , everything on it is so good that it is hard to pass up . also , having just suffered through some amazingly boring cheese platters , i can hardly recommend the one at public too strongly . my only complaint from all our visits is that the decaf espresso is weaker than dish water . when i asked our server , i was told that this is a problem that they have with the decaf . with everything else done to such a high standard , this seems like a problem that should be fixed . public may not be the trendiest or fanciest restaurant in town , but , day in and day out there are few that consistently do better . 
we ' ve eaten here three times since we moved into center city in august . the first time we had their family special , and it was good enough to get us to return for dinner on another night . the second time we had pho . very tasty . also shrimp buns which were quite good . the third time we took out of town family members for lunch the day after thanksgiving -- the pho was very weak . perhaps it needed to cook longer , and that ' s why it ' s much better at night . 
another gem across the street from my apartment . the price is right and the falafel is delish . the line moves super quickly so don ' t stress out , they ' re used to shuttling a crapload of people through there at lightning speed . there is practically no seating at all so if it ' s freezing outside and you don ' t live in the neighborhood ( yay ! ) then you might want to take a pass and return in the warmer months when you can kick it on a stoop or in ws park . 
we were in town for an all-day music festival at the nearby starlight ballroom and wanted to get some dinner between bands . thanks to yelp we located this place and i ' m very glad that we did ! at N Npm on a saturday there were only two other tables of diners and one waitress , but we were seated and served very quickly . i was impressed by the number of vegetarian and gluten-free items . we ordered a black bean and cheese empanadas which had a delicious crust and filling my entree was the tofu pepiada arepa and my partner had the asado negro . both were so flavorful and amazing ! for dessert we split the churros and cuaima ( chilie and cinnamon ) hot chocolate . the prices were reasonable and the service was excellent . i ' d visit this place again in a heartbeat while visiting ! 
i rather enjoyed my brunch here this morning , so am surprised to see so many low ratings . maybe it ' s not such a great spot for dinner ? but sunday brunch was a keeper . it ' s neither cheap , nor expensive , but fairly priced . i had the potato waffle benedict , which was really delicious . other kids at the table had french toast and the country breakfast -- all sizable portion wise , but not totally gluttonous . clientele is also pretty attractive , so a nice place to refuel , relax and gaze away a sunday morning . i ' ll certainly be back and curious enough to check it out for dinner some night . 
ye gods ! great spot , nice ambience , good service , and i get what they were thinking but jeezus what crappy delivery . the food here is nothing short of suckey . great ideas , but this place needs to either fire the cook , change the menu or both . if what they said in another review is true , that they came up with the menu by getting drunk and smoking a lot of pot , all i can say is the cook must have been getting drunk and smoking a lot of pot when he cooked our food . a downright abysmal dinner . the worst we ' ve had in years . ah you oh so cool but know nothing about food out-of-towners would you please stop posting your ridiculous reviews so that people who really like food won ' t waste time and money eating in places that if really rated correctly would go out of business . . . . fast . your revews are as pretentious as the food in this so not french food establishment ! i feel like i was ripped off . 
my favorite neighborhood bar . all of the staff are awesome , and their tap list is always refreshingly different . not bad prices either for the area . their food is better than most pub fair on most days . not exactly the establishment to get all dressed up for , but it ' s good for a nice chill night with a buddy or small group . but who knows , a handful of personal funny stories have originated there . 
the best food in newark new jersey and vani b does not know what he is talking about it smells like any kind of restaurant . the best time to go is every time and when there are soccer games the serves is amazing the workers they talk to you and see if every things okay
best to go with others who want to order and share . i split N pastas and N small plates with a friend . my favorite dish was the fettuccini with corn and scallions . sounds odd but was creamy and good . i would have happily eaten an entree size portion of that . we also had the salami del giorno in marmalade ( ok , and not very much on the plate for the price tag ) , baked pecorino with almond honey ( really good ) , and the buccatini with tomato and pancetta sauce ( good , but again , seemed a little expensive for what it was ) . service is very attentive and helpful in making decisions about what to order . 
this is where sushi and gastro meet ! the quality of the fish is spectacular ! but on top of that you will try it with experimental spices , herbs , sauce like nowhere else ! other than the fish , the pork belly is very tasteful and the fried chicken is the only one i can eat ! 
delicioso ! it is crowded , so definitely get reservations . it is byob , but they will treat you like family . there are only a handful of servers , so come with a tampered expectation of speed . however , it is so freaking worth it . the food is definitely fresh , the servers have an authentic accent ( a little hard to understand , but friendly ) , and they have a ton of specials . complimentary bruschetta at the beginning and cookies with limoncello at the end . authentic italian . 
our family has eaten here quite a few times , and everyone , from N years to N , loves the food . the food is very fresh , high quality and delicious . as with other peruvian restaurants i have been to , everything seems to be made to order . portions are generous and the service is excellent . the staff is attentive , very friendly and helpful with suggestions when asked . i have sampled many dishes here , from seafood to steaks , and it is hard to choose a favorite as everything is so good . 
fresh noodle made right in front of your eyes , great food and great price . 
under N bottle of wine while we waited helped because the place was packed and i hate getting bumped into . we got a table in the back and our waiter was attentive . apps . were good and i should ' ve order the prix fix because everyone around us had it and it looked goooood . i ordered the calf ' s liver and as much as i like liver a full meal was too much for me . both meals were delicious and the price was reasonable . need to try this place again and gallo nero and see who wins ! 
disappointed . my husband and i got there at exactly N N on saturday night and they turned us down telling us that they were " out of noodles " . yea , sure . don ' t advertise that your business closes at N when clearly you ' re not . wasted time and gas . 
 . . 
the best cuban , food in the city . 
probably still finding its legs i live in the neighborhood and am always looking for decent places for food and drink and just to hang out . i was sorry to see tapestry close . four stars for atmosphere in this place . the bar is nice and cozy . the look works . amazingly , even though it was crowded , it was easy for me to hear my companion ( we were seated at the bar ) without strain . the bar tender was knowledgeable and mellow . the craft beer selection was excellent . the space is divided into the bar area and the restaurant area . this division actually works . one thing that i liked about the place was the wide age range of patrons , at least the night i was there . i would give it N stars for this aspect of bsbh . . the food- disappointing . this i would give N stars . really too bad . i realize that one visit is not necessarily a fair assessment of a place , but they need to make the visit count if people are to return . the menu sounds interesting , but the preparation was somewhat uninspiring . crispy calamari was very good , as were the fries . the burger was over cooked- despite " medium " being requested . i had the parsnip gnocchi with lamb neck ragu . the gnocchi was over cooked , lacked the texture i was expecting and mostly became mush in the mouth . the ragu was bland- truly unfortunate . i bit more care with the food and maybe even taking a few risks with the preparation could make this an excellent place . since i live close by , if the food improves , i will addend this review . 
i love sanford ' s . it ' s a little ridiculous how often my husband and i eat here , and we have never had a bad experience . we dine in , we take out , we order delivery . we take friends , we order for friends - we have taken advantage of everything sanford ' s has to offer and have always left satisfied . i highly recommend their brunch , a great bargain including N cocktails , or if you ' re every available for breakfast on a weekday their prices and quality can ' t be beat . just last week my husband and i went for breakfast and had the oat bran waffle with two eggs , the croque madame , tea and coffee , for N . total . dinner is also excellent . i ' m a vegetarian and order a lot of their sandwiches and wraps without the meat , and they ' ve never messed up my order . their french fries are excellent , salads generously portioned , and pasta entrees easily leave you with leftovers to enjoy the next day . we are very happy to patronize sanford ' s , and highly recommend it to all our friends in the neighborhood . 
i have never written a review for a restaurant before but , i can ' t keep my mouth shut on this one . . . . the food was horrible and the service was frightening . i went to centro grill with two best friends to celebrate our recent birthdays . the restaurant was empty yet , they sat us in the middle of the dining room . . . . odd . we started with the sweet and sour calamari . it was extremely tough and the flavor was very overpowering . little did we know this was the best of what we would eat ( one of my friends actually had to spit a piece out . for entrees , we ordered the lobster mac cheese , the crab cakes with cous cous , and the salmon with mushroom risotto . the crab cakes were inedible and the cous cous tasted like it was cooked in old oil . the salmon was completely reheated ( it was obvious ) and the risotto had no flavor except for chemicals . i have never seen salmon so over cooked and dry . . . not to mention the odd white substance on one side . the lobster mac cheese was alright but , my friend kept chomping on pieces of shell ! our server noticed that my friend wasn ' t eating the crab cakes . she tried to be polite and say it was fine but he actually bent down and got in her face . . . so she finally said that she didn ' t care for them and that they didn ' t taste right . he promptly took her plate away and brought her another soda . he never said another word about it and did not comment on the fact that i didn ' t eat my meal . when he brought us dessert menus , i was still hungry so , we decided to give it a try . i ordered a lemon curd tart . . . i got something that was clearly lime ( it was green ) and garnished with shriveled blue berries and a rotten strawberry . i ' m seriously not exagerating . we also ordered a creme brulee . . . it was gross and also garnished with a rotten strawberry . when we got our check , the crab cakes had been removed however , our server made sure to include a copy of the check with them still on it . . . i assume so we would tip on the full amount . needless to say , i will never eat there again and i do not recommend anyone waste their money . . . it ' s not cheap ! i also got sick within an hour of leaving the restaurant . . . . yuck . 
i went to dinner with a group of N to calle ocho on a monday night . the have a nice big dining room in the back and it didn ' t feel overly crowded at all . there was music , but not so loud that we couldn ' t hear each other . the food was very good , but i didn ' t find it as memorable as at other restaurants . and for some reason it took a very long time for our food to be served . other than that , the service was great . i had a watermelon mojito , which definitely left something to be desired . it was way too sweet and tasted like a jolly rancher ' s . there was hardly any alcohol in it . my friends had the regular mojito , which they said was good , but a little weak . my friend asked the waiter to add more alcohol . all in all , it was a good place for a group , but nothing to write home about . 
fresh , tasteful food and good prices ( about N , - for a full meal in our case ) . being a tourist , i didn ' t find any other decent source of vegetables ( or meals that weren ' t deepfried and put on a bun for that matter ) in the whole city . it ' s easy , too . you grab a tray and a styro plate and put stuff on that looks good . they weigh the plate , and you pay by the pound . i would give them N stars if they had something for dessert , but i didn ' t find any . don ' t koreans have dessert ? or does it just not look like dessert ? i was craving for something sweet but was confined to dunkin donuts instead . 
this review gets N star only because N stars is not an option . and i am solely basing this review from my initial reaction to the place since it set the mood for my whole dining experience . first impressions really set the tone and the owner made it clear that this was not going to be an enjoyable experience . i can understand an hour wait time on a saturday night . i can understand a restaurant being crowded . what i cannot understand is an owner taking charge of the seating on his own and telling off customers and refusing to seat people until their wait time they were told was reached , even if there are tables available . before i was even seated , a lady had asked the owner if her table was ready . he told her no . she asked him when it would be and he immediately got defensive and told her that " the nicer you are to me , the nicer i am to you " . i couldn ' t hear what was said after that but a few seconds later he stormed off and she and her friends family left the restaurant . i never saw an owner of an establishment get so loud and red in the face over a simple question . well , our hour wait time was at it ' s N minute mark . we asked about our table . the owner told us that we were told an hour wait and we still had N minutes to go . the host marked down our names at the wrong time . we told him that the information was wrong and he began to tell us that his hosts write down our name and the time we gave our name and that they can ' t be wrong . a couple waiting next to us had to complain for us and defended us telling the owner that we had been waiting for just about an hour . he then seated us right away but did not hesitate to state the obvious to us that he was " going crazy " . he was not the only one going crazy . i was going crazy . the music was so loud that i felt like i was at a concert . the place could not handle the amount of people that were there and i was seated in an awkward spot with my chest at my table and my back practically touching the table next to us . the food was served quick . it seemed that everyone that i was with enjoyed it . but i have to say that after waiting an hour , we dined and dashed as quick as possible . the music makes you want to leave . you cannot have a conversation with friends at this place . and please do not tell them it ' s your birthday . the drums and the whistling from the little song number the staff does is louder than the music and i highly suggest you bring ear plugs to block some of the sound out . i just can ' t believe that as many people where there as there were . with this owner , i feel bad that people spend their money here and support his ways and the bad way he probably treats his staff . needs a new owner with a better attitude towards customers . 
my daughter is N years old and has a gluten allergy . east west says that they will make things gluten free . tonight we had take out from there , one dinner was supposed to be gluten free , nothing was marked . i called to see which one was , and they told me they had made one gluten free , then there was discussion and a female came back on the phone and she said the kitchen confused the order and made one without onions . this is a big deal ! onions or gluten . big difference ! if someone askes for gluten free , there is an obvious reason for it . the staff took this very lightly and it is not something to be taken lightly . we used to love this place , not any more ! ! ! 
whiskey lemonade , veggie wings , and nachos are my favorites here . the service here is great , the prices are a little higher than i enjoy but on par with the area . in my experience this place is the kind that does not try to rush you out . myself and a few friends ended up hanging out for hours eating appetizers and drinking a couple rainy sundays ago . i need to to try el camino ' s brunch . 
excellent food . excites the palate . we loved the grapefruit sangria . must try it . 
i ' ve been here a few times and the food is quite tasty . the reason i give this place N stars instead of N is because i ' ve had some good meals and some excellent meals . agricola is a farm to table , locally sourced , and seasonal fare restaurant . the menu is changing which is why some meals have been better than others . most recently i had burrata with fried green tomatoes , a goat cheese and potato terrine with roasted beets , and a mushroom flatbread . all were phenomenal . previously , i ' ve had two pasta dishes ( spring time veggie pasta with peas and a butternut squash pasta in a light broth-y sauce ) and they were both average , there was nothing very creative or memorable about either . i ' ve also had some amazing desserts ( homemade graham cracker and huckleberry ice cream sandwiches ) and cocktails ( gooseberry margarita ) here . the price point is a little on the high side but i definitely recommend it for an occasion . 
great picanha ! great items on buffet and fresh ! best weighing station in astoria . yummy ! 
grimaldis pretty unassuming from the outside and a bit dark on the inside and could easily be missed . we went there based on the tripadvisor score and it was right on ! it was four of us and we ordered two small specialty coal fired pizzas , the ron and paul young ( meatball , sausage peppers ) and another variety . get the pizza with both green and hot peppers , it was delicious and we left there stuffed . you will not be disappointed at this place . we also saw another party near to us having the oven baked chicken wings that looked deelicious ! if you are in the ft . lauderdale area , don ' t miss anthony ' s . 
i was very dubious about the praise my friend had for this place ( because really , i traveled to philly . . . for a burger ? ) but i trusted him . score one for john . i enjoyed the hell out of my pistachio encrusted lamb burger . i would ' ve like a nuttier crust on my patty but the description does say " lightly dusted , " and at least there were enough granules to taste it . the halved grape tomatoes paired perfectly , but the aioli wasn ' t very lemony . i polished it off within minutes because of its conservative size , but honestly i have no complaints . i would ' ve liked the addition of more traditional burger fixings , namely some greens , but the flavor profile stands well on its own as it is . the fries were okay , it ' s good to see seasoning before frying . next time i ' d ask to substitute chips instead , though ! their chips were almost airy and the texture reminded me of popchips . julie and john ' s kimchi shortrib burger sounded and looked tasty , filling me briefly with food envy as their plate wafted by my head . adult milkshakes were baller . as if shakes aren ' t decadent enough , let ' s make these things alcoholic ! i had the juan valdez since i ' m a patron xo cafe fan , but the silt of the coarsely blended espresso beans was an extreme turn-off once i approached bottom . story of my life this is why i should ' ve stuck with the caucasian . dating innuendo aside , the peanutbutterchocolatebanana was like a banana split in beverage form , and tasty if a bit too sweet for me . back bar is host to a cool dance space complete with disco mirror ceiling , hell-spawned candelit deer head , and giant projector screen over the wall bench . playlist was decent , and the walls were felted for decent acoustics . i like the unisex bathroom stall layout that puts both sexes on the same potty playing field . i also appreciated the check-in offer , though when i can only choose between kensington or miller for my freebie , i ' m clearly going to opt for the former . i can kinda see why this place made the douchiest bars in the city list , but i ' ll definitely be back for grub even if a better nightlife scene can be found elsewhere . 
good place to go for ramen . i actually prefer this place over rai rai ken . the place is quite small but the food is great . 
sat night . called N Npm . ordered chicken capriccio . cash only . told wait would be Nm to Nh arrived N N . food was warm and salad decent . a little over-saturated in sauce but taste was delicious . i would recommend again . 
what happened here ! ! i went to cranbury pizza about N weeks ago and had pizza . it was wonderful ! i came in today and it was the worst pizza i had ever had . i would rather go to papa johns . . i had a simple lg plain , and it was burnt , cheese was all over ( the little amount the pizza man put on it ) and the tast of the pizza was just bad . 
i was not pleased with the authenticity of food it was bland and has no flavor it tasted like broth will try again to see how it goes next time
best korean food i ' ve had in a while . . . we had the noodles mixed with veggies in the cho jang sauce and the pork bo saam . . . soooooooooooo bomb ! ! ! ! portions are huge and the service is the best i ' ve ever had in ktown and that ' s saying alot . . . the line gets long , but well worth the wait . . . 
coming from ca , i ' ve had much better cantonese food . hidden at the end of a strip mall , this place greatly exceeded my expectations for chinese food near the princeton area . there ' s an authentic cantonese-style menu at yao ' s that ' s completely in chinese . from that menu , we ordered the lu shui duck , salted fish and chicken fried rice , chicken with mushroom , sauteed veggies with garlic , and west lake beef soup . the lu shui duck was very mediocre . i ' ve had better lu shui duck from the chinese supermarket and definitely do not recommend this dish . the salted fish and chicken fried rice was on point . i have no idea why the chicken with mushroom dish was even on the chinese menu--it turned out to be a very americanized dish that don ' t get me wrong , was quite tasty . the sauteed veggies with garlic was superb . my favorite item was the west lake beef soup which was surprisingly one of the best i ' ve ever had . one thing i ' ve noticed is that prices in nj are slightly more expensive than prices back home in ca . the service was very friendly and attentive at yao ' s . i highly recommend this place for some great cantonese-style food . 
awesome ! ! 
potato eggs is amazing there . . . also try the eggplant . defonte ' s is one of my favorites . must try ! 
nice place good sandwich too saucy for me lay off the sauce and ill update my rating ! 
fantastic all around . we told them it was to celebrate our engagement and they treated us like kings , complete with champagne ready for our arrival and a great table . waitress could not have been sweeter and the food was outstanding . everything about this place was first class . 
we have frequented charcoal quite often , say once a month for quite some time now . while the temperaments of those on the floor consist of ebs and flows , the food brings us back . we appreciate the byob experience as we are able to bring the wines we enjoy rather than an overpriced menu with a wine selection you would find at a franchised establishment . we recently asked two couples to join us for dinner , as we have always had dishes presented and executed very well . the restaurant was busy , but make no mistake there was no line out the door . we attempted to " order " bread , yes now they charge you for it , but they " ran out . " we proceeded to order apps and our entrees . N min went by , apps arrived . nothing alarming , everything was as expected . however , the N min wait for entrees was unacceptable . you wouldn ' t think a restaurant of this size needed one , but they are in dyer need of an expo to keep them ontop of ticket times . chicken- a staple in any chefs basic training . why were pieces not cooked thoroughly ? steaks - rare , lamb - medium rare , chicken - simple , cooked throughly . not to mention ice cold potatoes and another guest in our party ordering carbonara , but receiving duck . she proceeded to wait for her correct entree to arrive while we all began to eat or attempt to eat . the server took the chicken off our bill . we ordered N of the brioche doughnut desserts . while the chefs sent out additional items to make up for the experience . they forgot the second order of what we actually asked for . at the end of the day , it is not about " freebies . " we frequent many of restaurants to enjoy the eclectic cuisines and presentations , the price is not an issue . what is an issue is the arrogant and overly self enthused chef who argues that he would rather not have bread available ( may i remind you , they now charge for ) than have waste at the end of the night . his tally of food cost is clearly more important than the availability of " menu items " and let ' s be honest , how much does it cost them to make bread ! the demeaner and attitude of " talking down " to a patron is unacceltable . belittling a guest is not the way to right your wrongs . not to mention arguing that the chicken was not raw . i invite him to take a look at the gummy pieces of undercooked chicken that graced the plate . i ' m sure it made it to the trash faster than it would have to his eyes . a restaurant owner i am not , but executing a thoroughly cooked piece of chicken , i am clear on . poor ticket times , raw chicken , incorrect food items , and lack of bread are going to be the things that keep the N additional couples and ourselves from returning ever again . it was an embarassment and a letdown . if your planning on charging patrons N for a N-Noz hanger steak , a N-Noz hanger steak is expected . we will not be returning to what we thought was a gem of a restaurant . 
if you are searching for good tacos in the neighborhood . . . stop looking and go here . your welcome in advance . 
i have been here several times now and it has always been a great experience . the small plates are great and the service is exceptional . it is really a neighborhood gem . 
the seafood pasta was delicious . love the front entrance so much . this time i tried the death by chocolate dessert . wow . will return with some friends . 
i went to this restaurant yesterday . this is the first time i have eaten a real italian ( european ) pizza , in N years of living in nyc . people line up at the dumbo grimaldi ' s pizzeria , which is very good , but it does not compare to this at all ! it is in a league of its own ! 
i went in after work recently not knowing what to expect . i found myself directed to a circular bar area with very out-of-date small tvs . the bar was very crowded with business casual guests . i fit right in with the crowd and made my way to the bar . before , i could order anything . . . the host of this small gathering sent over a glass of red wine . at first , i declined because i was in the mood for a beer but did not want to put-off the generous offer . i never asked what the house wine was , but it was outstanding . i browsed over the menu and asked the well-experienced male bartender for recommendations . he said " paella " without hesitation . unfortunately , it was way out of my price range for a weekday so i went with the pollo plato principal which had succulent chicken breasts sauteed with four good size shrimp , sherry , rice and appropriate vegetables . for N , this was a great value . back to the reason i mentioned the tvs , at this place . . . nobody cares about big screen tvs . it ' s all about great conversation , great food and class . i highly recommend this place , it was a tues night near the hartford wethersfield line , and the dining room was packed . this says alot ! 
i have been going to tortuga ' s mexican village for many years . i really enjoy their pico de gallo and chips , it ' s spicy and tangy ! hits the spot every time . the only downside is that you have to pay N every time you ask for it again ( the first one is complimentary ) . although it is a small place , it is very nice to dine . beware - they do not take credit cards ! ! ! strangest thing ever ! they take cash or check . . . really ? ! ? ! ? who takes checks anymore ? ! anyway , if you can get over that , then you should check this place out . it is a little pricey for being in princeton , but it is definitely a casual place to eat . i enjoy their burrito each time i visit . it is consistently good food . 
delicious . i got steak and eggs with chimichurri . so good . our waiter was also wonderful . attentive but he left us alone enough too . i would say this place is a great pick for getting brunch and catching up with an old friend . 
well , what can i say after countless panegyric reviews of this place ? obviously , the beer selection is outstanding i would even venture to say the best in town . the prices overall are friendly that prime N boasts a relatively good quality happy hour for its price is indubitable . unfortunately , the quality of service is appalling , sometimes even bordering on insulting . i blame partly the size of the place and prime N ' s silly reservation policy . if you find yourself there after N or Npm on any given weekday , good luck getting a table because the genius hosts will have decided to reserve a third of the restaurant ' s seating capacity for no one to sit at for some remarkable length of time , while groups of people ready to spill money into the restaurant ' s cash registers wait and wait . . . and wait . what does prime N do to reduce wait times for those standing while ensuring that reservations are honored , you ask ? they shamelessly ask their customers who are deciding to continue with another round of drinks to pack up and abandon ship so that new tables will open up for new arrivals to offend seated paying customers in order to make concessions for those customers who theoretically have not put a single penny in the restaurant ' s cash register let alone step inside the restaurant is revolting , tactless , senseless , and above all , infuriating . prime N can definitely do better ( i know because i was a regular ) . as a business tip , i suggest prime N refuse reservations at least for peak business hours . it ' s far more judicious as a business practice to service those that are actually there rather than cater to those who only promise to be . 
ah this is my favorite place to eat . . i cant cook indian food . . . and is one of my fav foods . . i love love love to go there . . . the food is the very best ! ! ! amazing flavours fresh and delicious . . simply the best . . . i cant wait to go back everytime . . wonderful and man many choices for a vegetarian . . ah just to think about this place makes me hungry d the service is so lovely . . its the best d
stage house is pretty good food , everything i have tried so far has been delicious . i really enjoyed my warm pecan goat cheese salad and would definitely recommend . their fries are delicious . i am one who really doesn ' t like hummus and even the hummus appetizer was fantastic . and for N pitchers of sangria , why not give it a try ? i would definitely go here again , there is so many more items on the menu i still want to try ! 
great food pork buns are a must ! ramen was excellent . we learned the hard way that this place is a byoc ( bring your own container ) we had no way of taking the ramen home . other than that , everything was fantastic ! 
dinner was great . two types of fresh breads were offered as we waited for our main dishes . the chicken rollatini and lobster ravioli was cooked perfectly . after dinner , sat at the bar and had a few types of drinks with my girlfriend . long island iced teas and redbull vodkas were mixed well . they are a bit pricey , but the owner made to the point that you do indeed get a full pint ! the owner and entire staff are knowledgeable and friendly . being such an old bar , the atmosphere might not be for everyone , but if you like the rustic ambiance , try this place . will certainly come back ! 
i really wish that i could give this place more stars , seeing that it has so many raving reviews . i came here on a weekend expecting a long wait , and boy was i not surprised . an hour and a half wait for two people . we stuck it out , and luckily several tables before us canceled , so we were seated within an hour . i wouldn ' t recommend coming here with a large group as they try to squeeze everyone into one large communal table in the middle . regardless of the size of your party though , be prepared for uncomfortably bumping into your neighbors . my friend just ordered meatballs , and i ordered the " smash " with beef meatballs , classic tomato sauce , mozzarella cheese , and " family jewels " ( a friend egg ) . they couldn ' t do egg whites only , but they happily changed my side from a small salad to broccoli which was nice . the meatballs themselves were pretty good . the main thing that prevented me from truly enjoying my meal was that immediately upon serving me my sandwich , the break was soaked with sauce and completely soggy . i ' m talking about oatmeal like consistency in the bread . so i give this place three stars because for the food i ate , it wasn ' t worth the wait . perhaps if i returned i ' ll definitely get something else that doesn ' t have bread with the dish . 
i applaud these guys for the success they have worked so hard for and they deserve every drop . that being said , no bad mojo going your way . i wish you many more years of success . i ' ve been dying to try this grilled cheese since it ' s beginnings . i stopped one afternoon on york st . for a bite . N is a little steep for a grilled cheese and i don ' t care what type of artisanal cheese you ' re using . oily to the point where i burned the tip of my tongue trying to bite into it . is it flavorful ? absolutely , but very oily . grilled cheese is a simple concept , but the flare they add with the add ons is very creative and flavorful . workers are very pleasant to deal with . line moves at a steady pace . just that price is steep . i can go to the corner of york and elm and get a huge burrito or cheese quesadilla for N ( not the guy across from au bon pain ) and still have some left over for dinner . again , these guys are out there hustling , doing a good job and are very nice . i can say that i tried it and encourage others to do the same at least once and have them decide on their own . 
i ' m originally from the area , and was checking out my old stomping grounds when we happened upon rocco ' s while looking for somewhere to eat . i was a bit reluctant as i ' d never eaten there before , and , to be honest , the exterior wasn ' t the most appealing ( although very clean ) . well , ya know what ? who cares ? this was the best pizza i ' ve had in years ! ! there were N of us and we were still talking about this pizza the next day , wishing we lived close enough to visit more often . i agree with the previous post , better than nyc pizza ( at least any i ' ve had recently ! ) . highly recommended , can ' t wait to go back ! please , everyone , patronize this place . . . i want to make sure it stays open ! 
yummm the sunday sangria spectacular was the perfect send-off for my friend who was leaving nyc . the food was different that some of the dishes you might be used to for a traditional brunch , but they were all delish . 
a lot of people complain about the price and the food quality , but sometimes never been here . to have an awesome quality and very good waiters you have to adjust the price for such awesomeness ! and for those there are complaining about the quality , it ' s because never went to a restaurant N stars ! 
nice unique atmosphere . great place for group dinners drinks . enjoyed their tacos and guacamole . prices are on the higher end considering their portion sizes . gluten free friendly with most options on the menu as gluten free . 
great atmosphere , good wines . the dish that standed out was the raw snapper in a ceviche style . so refined ! the other dishes the goat cheese croquetas , the bone marrow , the architchoke with mint were good like a b . the deserts were nice we took the creme brulee the orange bread pudding . also the great thing about this place is that the kitchen closes late . N am on friday night . also very convenient , their " bar jamon " . just next door , you can go have a glass of wine while you are waiting to be seated ( we waited N minutes . ) good wine selection and a cosy atmosphere also . good place to bring a date . 
my cousin had her rehearsal dinner here . . . everything was amazing . we had a giant barrel of sangria and so many delicious tapas . seafood paella was my favorite . so much fun ! 
my favorite bar in the area . outstanding beer selection that ' s constantly changing . the food is incredible but i feel spoiled with their shut up and eat deal . N entree between Npm-Nam and i find myself telling everybody about it . love this place . 
there ' s not much to add that hasn ' t already been said , but two things stand out N - go during lunch , there ' s little to no wait . N - get the pork buns . 
this restaurant was truely lovely . my boyfriend and i had an unforgetable night at little owl . as soon as we got there the staff and ambiance was so welcoming . they were playing great music and the whole vibe was just so alive and charming . our table wasn ' t quite ready so the hostess offered us a complimentary lass of prosecco while we waited ( the wait ended up being less than N minutes ) . here is what we ordered N appetizers avocado tomato prosciutto salad - excellent ! meatball sliders - i was hoping these lived up to the hype and they N did ! so juicy and tasty - cooked to perfection ! clams - tied with catch most delicious clams i have ever had we each ordered an entree i had the artic char which was incredible . this is not even a fish i usually order but it was excellent . i have been thinking craving it every night since we ate here . my bf had the lamb chops , which he seems to really enjoy . a bottle of malbec - delicious ! 
great food , great service , and nice ambiance ! what else it ' s there to say . go to soco ! ! 
i don ' t get it . i ' ve been here N or N times , each time hoping to have the near religious experience described by others , but it never happens ! the pizza is alright , not god like and certainly not worth the price . who exactly decided this was great pizza ? it ' s not even close to pizza suprema ! 
love this place . whether it ' s breakfast lunch or dinner the food is always great . fun atmosphere . bloody mary ' s are the best . love sitting out back and relaxing with family or friends . kid friendly . 
i wanted to order something i don ' t usually find back home , so i chose the veal chop , bone in . it was very tender and flavorful and was topped with ( i believe ) gorgonzola cheese and shitake mushrooms , along with a mild creamy white sauce . my appetizer was fresh mozzarella with tomato , a staple but well done nonetheless . together with a nice cabernet , the meal was delicious . the service was outstanding and the outdoor setting in the heart of little italy made for a complete dining experience . 
the food here is very good . great portions at a very reasonable price . service is lacking but understandable in such a small dining space . great addition to the neighborhood . a must . 
came on a thursday afternoon for brunch and i left a happy customer . not elated , just happy . this is a nice place if you ' re just looking for an ordinary and decent place for breakfast , nothing that ' ll blow your socks off . it ' s a small cafe with a very family-friendly atmosphere . the guy next to me ordered a tall glass of milk with his baked eggs ( which looked fluffy and savory ) and the waitress proceeded to remind him that not only his eggs , but his milk was also organic . not bad . the prices are a bit high for what it ' s worth . i ordered the french toast , which came with what tasted like homemade whip cream and fresh fruit . the bread was moist and sweet even without the maple syrup . for N bucks , it tasted just average . my friend ordered the breakfast sandwich . don ' t make the same mistake . save yourself N bucks and just get the baked eggs . overall , i would come back to this place if i was just in the area . nothing to get crazy about . 
a plethora of food options both surf and turf . great drinks , clean , kid-friendly . will likely return ( the husband and i will share N entree next time- the crab entrees are huge ! ) 
late supper review my son had steak frites and i had the cavatelli with short rib ragu . fantastic . if you ' re looking for a nice little place with great food , this is it . 
ordered here sat night delivery driver called me saying he was outside but he was not . i tried to ask where he was and he just kept yelling N N . that number has no relevance to my address . i tried to give him directions but he hung up on me . i called the restaurant to let them know and ask them to call and give him directions . N mins later no one has called me so i call the restaurant back she says she called him . . . N mins later he calls again yelling come outside come outside . . i told him i did not see him outside and where was he he started screaming N N N i said i have no idea what that meant he needed to tell me where he was he started cursing at me and hung up . i called the restaurant back and they asked why couldn ' t i meet him outside well bc hes not outside i have no idea where he is and when i ask he just yells at me and then started cursing she told me i would just have to cancel the order . so i never got any food and im waiting for them to refund my card . stay away ! ! ! ! ! 
thank you , thank you michael , abdul kenneth ! i had the pleasure of attending their soft launch on tuesday and was beyond impressed . from their well thought out drink menu , to their hospitable nature , to their hilarious house rules , these guys have definitely created a gem in tribeca . attention ladies ! they have these cool rotating hooks for your handbags at the bar . what a cool feature ! usually my handbag hits my leg the whole night- with this feature you can have your handbag rest to the left or right of your leg versus the front . oh and my favorite house rule respect our neighbors and the neighborhood . in other words- if you are douchey , please do not come here and be loud and obnoxious . last tip- be sure to try the moroccan martini ! now if i could only find a place like this in san francisco . 
i went to this place twice . the food was okay . it is very homemade grandma ' s cooking kind of feel . there is nothing that will make you " wow " about . if you want something plain and boring this is a place to go . the service is not so great . they seated us and never gave us bread until we requested for it ! after we go the bread it was just plain dry bread with nothing to dip . so we had to request again for the dippings . this happened both times i went ! the place is tight . you can hear the other tables convo very clearly ! the third time i attempt to go i had a drink with me . ( i was with a friend who likes some of the dishes they had there . so i was dragged along . ) they would not seat me until i dump my drink out ! its not like iam not going to order your food . what is the big deal ? i walked right back out ! the food was okay like i said but the service and because of my experience , i would not be returning any time soon . i understand the food is cheap you get what you pay for but seriously you are spending money here at this restaurant you deserve some kind of decent treatment . the place right next to it has the same rating . at least the waiters are so much more nicer ! 
i am a fan , but make no mistake about my stan-dom . i come here for the sandwiches , not the spiffy looking dude making the sandwiches , who i ' ve been seeing everywhere lately out of the shop . don ' t get me wrong , i love a spiffy man who makes sandwiches as much as the next girl , but there is a time and place for it and hanging out at a sandwich shop all day is not it . i am , apparently , alone in this sentiment every time i come here , there are gaggles of women inside and outside of the restaurant batting their eyelashes and putting on their most ridiculous giggles . moving on i had the oyster po ' boy the first time i came here , because the chicken was already sold out . my friend had the beef , which to this day she talks about like it ' s the best sandwich she ' s ever had . we also had some complimentary ben-yays ( beignets ) , thank god for phonics . which were as good as fried dough can be ? some special special flavored chips also available . i am a fan of the ginger iced tea , which was not quite iced . also , now i know why the chicken sandwich was sold out , it ' s slap your momma good . ps . check out the bathroom , it ' s basically a stylized port-a-potty with a flush function . i like . the stripped down seemingly undesigned decor seem to be all the rage these days . see also panda , it ' s so bare that the ac doesn ' t even act like it works . 
nice food
you can ' t go wrong at this sausage stop ! ! ! not only are the sandwiches top notch , but the staff is " go out of their way " friendly . you can get everything from a jamaican jerk chicken steak , made with fresh chicken breast , to a italian sausage wit , sauce and mozzarella cheese ! it ' s worth making the turn off of columbus blvd and heading to the home depot to find this hot-spot nestled right in the front of the bldg . 
song is simple pretty and the food is good . i like it for the decor and the fast and friendly service . 
just saw the episode of ' restaurant stakeout ' for this establishment and it confirmed my previous experiences of new jersey N years ago . those waitresses and managers wouldn ' t last a month out here in california , and he should have fired them immediately . the bimbo says she hates connollis when she works in an italian restaurant , on the east coast ? and no one , including willie , didn ' t go ballistic , when the manager grabs pizza slices , with his filthy hands , and then tosses them in the oven ? ? ! ! ! really ? ? ! ! in calif if you pulled that the board of health would shut you down in seconds . we watched you wipe your hands through your hair , put them all over that germ ridden counter and the cash register , then you handle some one ' s food with them ? i guess that ' s how it ' s done in jersey . but it looks like that ' s all you have to pick from when you own a business in jersey , judging by the review from lauren g . 
bartenders are some of the nicest guys ever ! ! we got the smoked short rib meatballs . . . N amazing balls ! we inquired about the cave aged amish cheddar that ' s in the mac and cheese . . . . and norm went to the kitchen and chef let us try some slices with a little house-made jam . nice crew , great food ! 
i had their coconut bubble tea , it was horrible . but boba was hard as if it had been out for days , and the tea it self tasted burnt and it was barley sweetened . i was disappointed to know that they did not serve warm bubble tea , since it is cold outside . many other bubble tea places that i have tried have been much better , for a better price , and have had both hot and cold bubble tea options . i did not try anything else in the restaurant but the place did smell nice and was very nicely decorated . 
delicious ! the chicken shawarma and the beef lamb shawarma are the best , in my opinion . the fish shawarma is good , but nothing to write home about ( to be fair , tilapia is pretty bland at the best of times ) . the sauce here is absolutely amazing though ! you can get extra sauce , which i always do because it is the best part . the sandwiches are nicely complemented by pickles and various other fillings . they are also easier to eat neatly , since they are wrapped up burrito-style . prices are a tiny bit on the pricier side for a food truck , but certainly not unreasonable for such delicious food . the guy working the truck is also super nice . if you go a couple times , he will remember your order ( or at least make his best attempt to remember it ) . he ' s always been pleasant when i stop by . 
one of my favorite fish chips spots , i live in bk , but anytime i pass through i have to stop here . 
went to this place on a whim . it was too hot to sit up stairs so we sat outside . it was very lovely . the service was a bit curt but the food more than made up for it . the curry goat was too die for . i ate way too much but that was fine because i ate the rest later that night . if your in the area this is a must try ! 
since it is one of the closer places to where i work at on spring garden , i have been here probably a dozen times over the past N years for lunch . guess the two thing i would say is that it is a decent-enough option for lunch ( not dinner ) and that you get consistent inconsistency in the service , quality of the food , and the time it takes to bring out the food . it isn ' t that crowded at lunch though so you can always get seated quickly which is a plus if you only have an hour or so for lunch . service ranges from friendly to surly . seems to depend greatly although the waiters waitresses don ' t generally have to cover that many tables at one time . generally N-N tables which isn ' t bad although they can be stretched thin if they only have one server working the late lunch crowd at N N or N . as for the food , fried calamari tends to be one of the better appetizers although they could use a side of marinara instead of just drizzling on the bottom of the plate . wings aren ' t bad either . soups range from ' tasty treat ' to ' death by salt . ' i would generally avoid them unless you really want soup . ditto the mussels too . i love mussels and you just don ' t know if they will come out overcooked here , not cleaned enough , or just right . given the price tag , it just isn ' t worth getting a plate of half-edible mussels . hand-cut fries aren ' t bad and the sandwiches are usually decent enough although they won ' t blow you away either . it isn ' t a vegan-friendly place but there are a couple of offerings including a portabella mushroom sandwich and a few salads that should tide any vegetarians you are dining with . basically it is a place that has solid lunch bar food or wouldn ' t be bad to order a beer wings to watch a phils ' game . it isn ' t a place i would bring a date or go for dinner though . they also have a nice range of beers on tap which is probably the best thing about kite key but i would never order a beer at lunch while at work ( make that two beers ) . 
went here for dinner last thursday and i was not wowed . they were out of the thursday special that they ' re supposed to have every thursday according to menupages and their website . food was okay but not great . . . i had the salmon . . . just meh . my friend had the vegetarian paella , which was pretty good . but the yuca fries couldn ' t hold a candle to the ones at yuca bar . and at like N a pop , the cocktails were okay but not great . our waitress had an attitude problem and got the bill wrong . i might go back again to try their brunch or N mojitos , but only if i were already in the area . the place itself was spacious and well-decorated . . . but . . . i wouldn ' t go out of my way for it . 
i am a yale student and have eaten here before . however , i don ' t think i will be returning . i was getting breakfast this morning and i saw the staff show no respect to a group of people who were just trying to be seated as a large party . i was not even the target and it made me feel very uncomfortable . i will be getting brunch at me n ' u or bella ' s from now on . i suggest you do the same . 
this place is a great addition to the neighborhood . i ' ve been here twice and everything ive had is great . i really suggest the pasta with vodka sauce and proscuitto . it was great ! the sauce was delicious and much lighter than most vodka sauces which is great when you ' re eating pasta in the summer months . they ' ve got a great wine selection , friendly bartenders and its not even that pricy ! 
this is a great place to get authentic mexican food if you ' re in the area . all the food is fresh , well made , flavorful , and the staff is extremely courteous . a definite win . 
in town for business and linden has a nice plaza . went to chevy for drinks but i dont like their food . then went to applebee for appetizer to do a time track . then went for sushi because my intern loves it . the place is decorated with nice interior . the places is busy and the sound level is workable . i went there saturday and sunday for lunch and it was pack . being pack you still respected and treated with great service . the british sushi guy made my lunch with a roll i never had . he called it " your momma got saucy " . will come back again . i wonna try the bbq table next time i go . 
this is the best crepes place in town ! ! the french cook are super friendly ! ! they are from lyon ) tres bien i love it ! the price is very reasonable ) atmosphere is simple and clean overall , love it . 
always a great meal and good drinks . staff is nice and the prices are good . the spicy chicken is an absolute must ! this place has become a regular for us even though we don ' t live that close . 
have never met such a friendly staff . priscilla was one of the nicest and most attentive bartenders i have ever encountered . if i owned a bar i would totally steal her . food was also very good , and the ambiance was cool . definitely would go again . 
i didn ' t like this place at first but it ' s really close to our house and was the only decent thai place in park slope . after awhile i realized the awesomeness that is song . the restaurant is roomy , modern and they have a beautiful backyard . club music plays because thats just how all asian places roll . the service is meh but again that is very common in asian restaurants . they want you in and out ! but the food . oh . my . god . they have the best pad see ew . soft noodles covered in rich brown sauce steaming hot . i don ' t know what they put in this noodle dish but it is amazing . don ' t worry it ' s not super salty , just really flavorful . their curries are really good too . the green curry is tasty , the veggies are fresh and great huge portions ! their roast chicken is ok , there ' s a thai place in manhattan that does it better but song ' s is decent . the thai fried rice is great , a little sweet , perfect meat to rice to veggies ratio . the beef fried rice is very good as well . their prices are unfreakin-believeable ! ! ! ! how do they afford to stay in business charging people so little for such amazing food with huge portions ? ! ! ! maybe its a mob front . that ' s the only explanation . but i don ' t care i hope song stays the same forever because i will be going there for thai food forever . 
there pizza is so good they have a slice of pizza for only N cents . they have pepperoni bread for N cent . their food is sooooo good ' 
the sweet potato empanadas are amazing . oh yea and the pineapple margaritas . . . that really helped me forget how damn cold it was outside . 
my main problem with their food is that it is undercooked . i ordered ceviche and clam chowder . the ceviche should not have been called ceviche . it had absolutely no acidic substance in it -- no lime juice or anything like that -- so it was completely raw . the flavors it did have -- some kind of weird green sesame-lettuce paste or something like that -- were unpleasant . i didn ' t finish mine , despite being quite hungry , because the raw scallop combined with lettuce-sesame paste was just too disgusting . my clam chowder was okay . but the clams inside it were raw . i understand that you don ' t want to overcook clams and make them rubbery -- but they do need to be cooked . also , the clam chowder was very salty ( more so than the usual ) . i ' m sure they would have cooked it more if i had asked , but i ' m not always comfortable sending stuff back . 
terri . . . . i am smitten with you ! i ' ve been here over a dozen times in the recent months , and am positively thrilled that a vegan grab-n-go restaurant has opened spitting distance from my apartment ! the butterfinger-chocolate shake is . . . well . . . . eh hem , excuse me while i wipe the drool off my face . even my anti-soy roomie was blown away by it ! chicken bacon cheddar ranch is a must try , but i ' ve pretty much had nearly every sandwich on the menu . i certainly prefer some things over others , but there was nothing i didn ' t like . also , some fellow yelpers have mentioned that the food is too " heavy " . there are certainly heavy options on the menu , but there are equally as many lighter choices . staff here is ridiculously friendly , and have helped me with my panicky indecisiveness during every visit - thanks guys ! 
really enjoyed the service , atmosphere and food . only issue was the image of the spicy potatoes is different from what is served . what i got looked more like seasoned french fries then the round balls seen on the website . also , any food with nuts in it should be specified on the menu . although most foods were listed with nuts i got one that did not specify that and with a nut allergy could have been an issue . fortunately , it was not an issue this time . overall i enjoyed my afternoon of tapas at amada and look forward to returning for some paella . 
love it ! great food , great times , and great people ! 
great cheesesteaks ! ! ! they are huge ! love . this place . . . pizza is decent , and italian dishes are delicious . 
so , even though i said i would never go back , and even though i pressed all of you not to go there either , i believe i am a changed woman . after posting the below review i was quickly contacted by jason , the owner . we exchanged a few notes , built a dialouge and he convinced me to come back . so i did . one day after some christmas shopping around town- first the christmas village outside of city hall and then macys ( they need to stop doing that light show , it ' s impossible to shop . ) - the fiance and i decided that we needed to rejuvinate ourselves and what better way than with wine and a snack . as is our usual mo we sat at the bar . the bartender was right on us as soon as we sat , menus , wine list and a glass of water . i ordered a wine flight , which i think is the best deal going ! i think it was N for N wines , and the pours were more than what i would consider decent . it was an added bonus that all three of the wines were yummy ! we proceeded to order food- charcuterie plate , escargot and the burger . all in all , the food was great . it came out in a decent amount of time . the burger was cooked to a good medium rare , the escargot were the right amount of garlicky and the charcuterie plate was well balanced , and we got a nice description of every last thing on the board . this most recent visit was far better than any of the previous three . i was certainly pleased with the service- just not having to ask for a glass of water was worth the return trip . i take back what i said . go and try it for yourself . order a wine flight . try the escargot . enjoy the periodic table of elements , i mean grapes , poster in the rest room . bring someone with you . have a good conversation . enjoy . 
i was very shocked as i expected this place to be good . guess you really can ' t go by what is on the website . i got a chicken taco ( which was really dry and the lettuce on it was awful ) , sweet plantains that were deep fried ( who deep fries sweet plantains ? ? ) and a potatoe ball which was awful as well . the filling tasted like beef and salsa mixed into one . i thought i ' d give it a whirl but i definitely will stick to croisillimo in new britain as their food is phenomenal . epic fail milagros . i will not be back ! sorry ! 
great , authentic northern chinese grilled skewers ! if you ' ve been to beijing or other northern areas of china , you ' d know the smell and taste of those cumin fragrant lamb skewers . this place delivers the flavors and taste of those same tasty street snacks . so glad i found this place ! a tasty snack that you don ' t find too often outside of china . and the owners were extremely friendly too ! 
can someone please explain to me the hype over joe ' s ? ? ? think i ' m missing something but my two experiences here have not warranted anything above an a-okay dumpling house . typical chinese pushy in out service , check . not so good xlb , check . typical chinatown hole in the wall , check . skin is too thick and rough , takes actual skill , time technique to craft a thin skin soup dumpling that doesn ' t fall apart . definitely not worth the wait . 
miss southern atmosphere ? miss southern food ? think you can get them here , i ' d say better than other similar concept restaurants in nyc . i like the ambience , and staffs are very kind . some couples , some are tourists , families , kinds , some are old customers . . . . it ' s great for everyone . definitely i ' ll drop by and have some southern soda ( their serving glass for it is super cute ) whenever i go nearby . 
awesome ! 
maple butter is so good , m it should be fed intravenously . incredible experience w waitstaff perfect last minute idea for a birthday dinner outing the fried chicken and waffles is a must-try and the pricing reasonable for a big party ! intimate , great colors and decor in space you can see into the kitchen too which is a major plus
i ' ve been here twice and had a great experience both times ! the food is priced well , great portions , and the staff is very attentive and friendly . the food taste fresh , is hot and they give you a hug portion for the price paid . 
i have been going to indian hut for some time now . i am really impressed with the breads here like keema naan . i also never had indian chinese food before coming here . the gobi manchurian and chicken manchurian are sublime . 
aazing ! 
i haven ' t been to a lot of japanese noodle shops outside of those that serve ramen , so it was nice to stop by soba-ya and enjoy a lunch that focused more on the other noodle offerings the cuisine has to offer . even though we got there shortly after it opened on the weekend , it was nearly full by the time we got seated . there ' s a reasonable amount of seating , but it is cozy and can fill up on a cold winter day quite quickly . service is pretty standard , although they do a good job of keeping your water glass filled . as for the food - my fiancee wasn ' t as big a fan , but i think there ' s a heck of a lot of variety when it comes to picking out your broth choices , the additional toppings , as well as the noodles themselves ( most of the dishes can be served with either soba or udon ) . i went with curry broth , which is a bit heavier than what i feel would be standard , but it wasn ' t as heavy as what you ' d find over rice , and it worked well with the buckwheat noodles in providing a warm dish ( adding some scallions on the side to up the heat a little didn ' t hurt , either ) . my fiancee had a version with duck while the meat was pretty standard , the broth definitely was infused with the rich flavors of the meat . we also got a couple pieces of inari - pretty standard if anything , you can tell that they ' re not really using rice that you usually find at a sushi place - it was standard-use rice . in all , a nice little noodle shop among the many japanese restaurants in this part of east village . i ' d stop by again to try one of their many different dishes out . 
considering i only eat dumplings when i go to chinese restaurant and the pork and crab dumplings are what this place is known for , i liked it . the waiters are fast and pretty much tell you what to order so word to the wise don ' t take too much time because they want to turn the tables over fast . you ' re also going to be seated with random strangers so that might be something to note too especially if you plan on putting away some tsing tao ' s . 
maybe the worst bar to watch sunday football in the city . the owner changed the games when there were mulitple critical plays going on at the end of games . also the burger was actually burnt and the onion ringers were doughy . if you ' re going to spend money to enjoy your football experience don ' t do it here . 
i go back and forth on this place , because i love vegetarian food ( i ' m not a vege , but i find the food to be a little more interesting ) . service is sometimes good , sometimes bad . i ' ve never had an over friendly experience , but the service was always efficient . some vegan stuff can be a little dry , but generally pretty good . takeout is my best suggestion , although eating in can make for some interesting people watching . new haven ' s good like that . 
cafe habana is one of the best spots to eat at in the city ! i really love this place , the delivery speed is lightning fast , customer service is on point and most important the food is great ! i suggest that you get the blackened chicken its a great dish ! 
great atmosphere for football better tomatoe pies ( " clams casino pizza " worth a try . . . tasty specialty pie , and N . N bar pies sunday football ) . . . what ' s not to like ! ? 
excellent ! very fun tour plus you get lunch ! scott loves pizza and knows a lot about it ! best tour in nyc ! 
awful . this place should not be rated this high . just to be clear this is primarily a bar bordering on a pub style atmosphere . the night i was there patrons were drunk and very loud . the lighting and ambiance was poor . i ordered a basic beef burger and it lacked taste . the bun was microwaved and stale and they gave me a select helping of microwaved from the " night before " styled fries . the bartender was nice and serve me a martini . the martini was decent , but again over priced . i can ' t recommend this place . please think about better pubs in the area like the eulogy belgium pub . good luck in philly . 
 ! i have to say that this is my favorite place in midtown . whether or not i ' m coming home from work , meeting friends for lunch on the weekend , or wandering around late after a night out with friends , woorijip has never let me down . to put it simply , this is one of the few spots i know where you can get an awesome entr e , a soup or salad , a beer , and sit down in a clean restaurant for N . the staff is always super nice and they do a great job serving the massive crowds that come here . to top it off , you can get reasonably priced beer , wine , or soju with your meal . they have an above average selection of both domestic and foreign beers to choose from . one bottle typically runs you N . not bad at all . my go to meal sierra nevada pale ale , bulgogi with clear noodles , and a salad with italian dressing . i ' m happy to say that i ' m a regular . i ' ve already filled up one of my woorijip rewards cards . i have my eye on the prizes behind the counter . see you there ! 
this review is long overdue . so long overdue , i can ' t even remember what i had , but i do remember that the food was so good , and friend N and myself were so eager to eat our food so delighted by our meals that friend N was mortified , but then forgot about her embarrassment when the deliciousness of her food hit her too ) 
just okay for a lunch place . had an omelette . nothing special but not terrible . 
i like the basic food and the great pub feel . it is priced right and feels comfortable like a good old pub . i think if you don ' t have high expectations you will love it . it has a good menu and the tap is good selection , not fancy but simple and good ! 
took a gander into old city and tried out zento because it had a favorable number of reviews on here and who i am to go against the grain when it comes to sushi since i ' m not expert , yet . the ambiance that zento gives off is pretty relaxed , a good spot for a casual date , with a friend or possibly by yourself at the bar . lots of wood and low light mood lighting compliment each other well and the seating is spread apart enough not to be part of another groups conversation . i ordered a specialty roll and regular style and my friend did the same , he ' s more the sushi expert and he he gave it N stars for freshness . service was average until i spotted the owner and actually knew him from his previous venture at the same venue . than the service was really good . all in all a good japanese spot worth trying at least once and a welcome addition to old city ' s revival . 
this is the only branch of the mighty ippudo outside of japan itself . having been to japan N times ( really ) , i can tell you it tastes the same , and it ' s great . to those who say " theme park behavior of staff " i say baloney . every real japanese establishment greets you and sends you off with the goofy shouting ( ok not always shouted but definitely loud ) . it ' s considered rude not to . so enjoy the authenticity ! to those who say " you can make it at home " baloney . . . they boil pork downstairs for N hours to get that broth , then season it with things you don ' t have . to those who say " it ' s all msg " baloney . . . ( see above ) . that woozy feeling comes from a big warm belly full of fatty amazing pork broth and carbs . you ' re not drugged . you ' re well-fed . add the decent sake collection , and i ' m happy . the only thing missing is these amazing carmelized gyoza pork dumplings on the menu in japan only . but i can wait . . . . 
just getting home from my Nth dinner here in the short time this restaurant has been open . . . . . just love everything about it . . . . . . tonight was my Nrd and final birthday celebration , all which have been here at stone hearth . . . every time we have dined here , we all loved our meals . . . . . from apps like pizza , to salads to entrees and desserts . . . . all really really good . . . . . and you know you can also dine relatively healthy with paleo foods , foods under N calories etc . . . . bread made on premises . . . . creative salads . . . entrees include fish , chicken , steak , pasta . . . . i love the bucatini with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella , and the meatballs with spaghetti squash . . . . desserts awesome . . . . . . good price point . . . manager howie is very personable and attentive . . . . really cares ! ! ! love our server jessica . . . . warm , comfortable and inviting atmosphere . . . child friendly as well . . . . . . on one visit came with our granddaughter ! ! can ' t say enough positive . . . . . do go yourself to see what i m talking about and enjoy ! ! ! ! jeanie h
as one other helper said , overly hyped . i live in the neighborhood and have walked by this place on a consistent basis for the past N years and it constantly has a line . i always wondered why ? so i was speaking to a chef friend who told me how famous this place is for its breakfast . so i figured i was home from work one day and would try it . imho . . . . average . i ' ve had better breakfast at a hole in the wall diner in jersey . i can ' t speak for the pancakes but i had french toast . kind of dry . although the caramelized bananas were good . for the price tag i can walk N blocks to cornerstone cafe and get a better , cheaper breakfast ( 
korean tacos tonight w irene as our bartender . good times ! 
amazing ! just a tip you have to make a reservation well in advance
pizza squares - awesome ices spumoni ice cream - awesome sit down restaurant - used to be awesome , but the old man chef recently died and it ' s now below average . 
as a long time philadelphian , i ' m a fan of the cheesesteak . pat ' s isn ' t typically where i go and purchase steaks , but if i have family in town and wish to treat them to a little bit of culinary history , i stop here . let ' s clear some things up . pat ' s is the originator of the cheesesteak . they don ' t require flashing lights or degrading slogans to sell cheesesteaks . their legacy and food sell themselves . also , as a local university student i would lead freshman groups down to this location to experience the original steak . this isn ' t where many of them would eat steaks after that night , but they had to experience it once . the way to go here is american or provolone wit . cheese whiz is a novelty that i don ' t understand , but am guilty of having enjoyed for many years . frank o . told me that provolone is the best you can get because that ' s how pat originally made them . get that , with some onions , and nothing more . taste the steak without any extra baggage to determine if you like it . you won ' t regret it . 
most awesome happy hour deal in town with delicious and plentiful asian fusion dishes ! we ordered almost everything from the hh menu . my favorites were kobe sliders , korean bbq lettuce wraps , and edamame dumplings . 
been coming here for decent korean food ! i won ' t mention what others have , but i would recommend coming here during lunch and evening rush hours . food tend to be more fresh and they just keep flowing . . . . recommend spicy chicken with kimbap plate . N . N stars for food and convenience ! 
wonderful place ! . huge selection of teas , very quaint . i liked it better when it was less well-known , but i guess any quality establishment gets crowded after it gets discovered in new york . good lunch specials and i find it ' s a good place to go for a tranquil , refined meal as a break from the chaos of ny . highly recommend anything from their menu . black sesame creme brulee , japanese toast with jasmine ice cream , amazing desserts , amazing savory dishes , amazing soups , amazing service . what an adorable tea place ! 
very friendly and efficient service . not my favorite vietnamese restaurant but i would return if i was in philadelphia as the food was pretty good ! 
came here for my sister ' s birthday . this place is all kinds of delicious . we had the chef ' s tasting menu . this is very affordable ( N ) . the menu is pretty seasonal , all i can say is , you must try this place . it is worth calling to make a reservation of your are looking to eat on a busy night . the food trumps the cocktails , but who cares ! ? the food is so good . i ' d rather eat my calories than drink them . don ' t have any foodie pictures to share because i was too busy eating to take pictures ! 
cute ( read small ) and casual with good , sometimes very good cuban . reasonably priced food with friendly and efficient service . personally i like the churrasco and adobe pork chop . pretty good for this price range . . . . 
three of us went for quizzo on a rainy night . we got the vegetarian combination - which was alot of food ! all of it really good . they have some great ( cheap ) drink specials . and , large round bar is great for people watching . friendly and inexpensive spot . 
i stood on line for only ten minutes ! yes , that ' s right . their pizza is thin crust smaller pizza . it ' s not like new york pizza . it ' s very yummy . it ' s not the best pizza in the world , but it is yummy . everything is priced fairly . for as small and busy as the restaurant is , the staff is really nice and courteous . that ' s a hard thing to accomplish . 
this place is so ah-mah-zing ! ! ! i went with my boyfriend because i work in the area , and it never disappoints . the pizza is unbelievable and the portions are not hog portions . the appetizers ( i had the pate ) , pizza and pasta is some of the best i ' ve had in the city . not to mention , they have a good beer selection which is hard to find . overall worth every single penny ! ! 
best restaurant in the area ! it is quite pricey , but well worth it . to start off the meal , the bread is probably the best substance on the face of this earth . and then any option on the constantly changing menu has proved itself to be exquisite ! i would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a really great meal ! 
what in the hell do they put in the fish here ? if red bull had traces of cocaine in it , then this stuff has crack in it . there is nothing i can say other than this place serves up some of the best sushi i ' ve had in the city . and for little money , i think it ' s completely worth it . 
best burritos i ' ve ever had in my life ! the carnitas one is amazing , and they ' re seriously about as big as my head . i dare say they ' re better than chipotle ! 
i went back again and friday night with the hubby alone and ordered appetizers from the specials . i didn ' t like the sardines at all . i like fish , but they cannot smell . and these did . i also thought the appetizers from the specials were overpriced at N each and the portions were a little small . sorry i didn ' t take a picture . i am not used to pulling out my phone and snapping shots of food while dining out . . . in the future i will stick with the appetizers from the regular menu which run N each , are are quite good . dinner was delicious . i had the duck and my husband had the flank steak , also off the specials . both were delicious but was a little disappointed that they would not allow us to substitute the side orders at all ( i really didn ' t want the fries with the duck ) . i would have paid the extra cost , but the waitress wouldn ' t allow it . oh well . . . the drink was small but packed a punch . quite strong . we had the jalapeno margarita . only needed the one drink for the night . overall , great experience . lovely atmosphere , seats you quickly . ask for the garden room in the back . 
vernick food drink restaurant N walnut st , philadelphia , pa N ( N ) N-N vernickphilly . com open tuesday-sunday N N pm to N N pm dinner N N pm to N N am bar located in the rittenhouse square section of philly , vernick , named for chef and proprietor gregory vernick , uses locally sourced ingredients to create this modern american cuisine restaurant . the drinks featured are some of the best in the city and vernick also features some homemade sodas and other refreshing beverages such as lemonade which are certainly worth a try . i must comment here on the pimm ' s cup--certainly the best in the city . the dandelion ' s rendition of the pimm ' s cup had been reigning supreme until now . award for best pimm ' s cup in the city--vernick . we were seated in a sunny upstairs dining area with beautiful open air windows out onto the street . ethan was our server and he was prompt , unobtrusive and professional . he catered to our every need and was knowledgeable and accessible . vernick ' s rendition of the pimm ' s cup pimm ' s N , vernick lemonade , mint . vernick makes its own lemonade and it tasted divine . we started dinner with a wonderful amuse bouche . light biscuit with a chilled soup . very tasty . then the tuna poke , macademia nuts , sweet soy . poke is just another word for raw tuna . it was delicious . perfectly seasoned and much better than ahi tuna or ceviche . this was quite a treat . arctic char , crispy skin , dill . not one of my favorite dishes of the evening partially because the fish tasted too close to sashimi-- kind of bland , tasteless . the char was interesting and crunchy though not very well seasoned . fromage blanc , pickled cherries . fromage blanc ( also known as maqu e ) is a fresh cheese originating from the north of france and the south of belgium . the name means " white cheese " . it was served with olive oil and bread and tasted amazing . peach and lamb confit salad . confit is a french method of cooking that bakes meat slowly in fat . this fatty lamb combined with the delicious in season peaches made for a sweet , succulent aftertaste that was accented by the mixed vegetables served with the dish . outstanding dish here . pork blade steak , glazed radishes and plums , plum mustard . one word fantastic . the main course was outstanding and was served with mixed greens which accompanied well . berry rhubarb crisp . cream cheese gelato . stand back because this dessert will make you want to have your cake first . unbelievable finish to a meal . it was pretty consistent too throughout the courses that there was quality , presentation , and overall great taste to almost all the dishes . i personally didn ' t care for the arctic char but that is just because i tend to shy away from sashimi dishes . consistent quality and service . highly recommend this restaurant . of note a contemporary steel cabled staircase leads to the second floor . there is a lovely serving island on the second floor . huge downstairs bar area . clean restroom facilities . an open kitchen layout gives diners the opportunity to observe food as it ' s prepared as well as the staff preparing it . 
this restaurant is good for latin fast food . the atmosphere is fun , the drinks are pretty good and they have a good happy hour menu that on certain nights is extended all night ! they automatically provide plaintain chips with a house-made dipping sauce which is good enough to fill you up before you eat a deliciously fried empanada . the empanada was as good as it gets . i tried the portabella quesadilla and it was good . the guava empanada is also good , but it all felt really heavy . if you are watching your diet , avoid this place ) 
we used to go here years ago . i ' m not sure why we stopped . we went there saturday night and had one of the best meals we ' ve ever eaten . my martini was perfect , both appetizers were perfect also . my only complaint is how hard it it to get in on a saturday or friday night ! make sure to make reservations . 
there was a point in my life where i didn ' t like chinese food whatsoever . those days are long gone and would have been eradicated much sooner had places like han dynasty been around . truth be told , i have a palate that ranges from rags to riches . honestly , often times , i ' d be quite satisfied ordering a curry chicken combo w pfr ( pork fried rice ) at N Nam with ' chicken ' as questionable as the north philadelphia neighborhood that housed the corner chinese restaurant complete with bulletproof glass and ordering window . but i digress , han dynasty or " handy nasty " as it ' s come to be called is truly remarkable . i had high hopes and they were completely fulfilled . i ' ve had copious amounts of chinese food , everywhere i go , in the full gamut urban corner takeout places , modest strip mall restaurants and reasonably upscale dining . my first experience with han dynasty was amazing . the dishes all seemed a bit atypical from your average and expected offerings such as kung pao and general tso ' s , that ' s a good thing . what exists is really a nice selection of dishes , notably ones that cater to those who prefer some spice in their meals . service was adequate when it comes to your typical attentiveness . one thing that i truly appreciated though was the capability and insistence to speak up when there ' s better pairings and choices to be had . for example , i had my mind set on cumin beef as i tend to just avoid lamb being that it doesn ' t really do me well there ' s something about it i don ' t like . the server suggested otherwise and i was wholeheartedly satisfied with his suggestion and appreciated his advice . lastly , protip i ' m a big fan of insanely spicy food but generally speaking still order things so that they ' ve got a good kick to them but still tolerable to eat in long sittings . that being said , i ' d stick to around N or N on most things , which is probably higher than most people . i ' d like to see somebody order the spiciest dish at a N , i don ' t think that ' d even be edible by most people . also get the dumplings in chili oil . you won ' t be disappointed . one visit warrants N stars from me , i ' m craving going there again . with my constant desire to check out new places and never hit up the same spot twice so often . . . this is pretty remarkable . 
went here for sips . the selection was amazing . edamame dumpings . . . yum ! the staff was very pleasant , especially during the busiest time of year . . . we had a reservation and got a table N minutes ahead of schedule . i will absolutely be going back here . 
what a fantastic place . great ambiance . amazing food . nice drinks . service is great too . i keep going there again and again to eat the matador combo . prices are reasonable too . 
walking home one night after a late dinner , we saw a line of people stretching an entire nyc block . what the heck ? ? ? they were lined up at a halal food cart ! and , there were two others within sight that had maybe two people in line . . . something was definitely up . i knew yelp would clue me in . . . N stars . . . the number one rated halal cart in the entire city ! rumors were that it was the mysterious white sauce . for N . N you get a plate piled high with either chicken or gyro meat , rice , and a salad . after they slop it onto your paper plate , they squirt the sauce of the gods over everything . that ' s it ! that ' s enough . another consummate new york experience . . . 
first time i ' ve ever been here and i can see what the hype is all about . can ' t believe i didn ' t know about this gem until now . super good food , attentive servers that don ' t rush you ( we were there for three hours ! ) , fun ambience . . and all at ridiculously dirt cheap prices in new york standards . they have an awesome hh special - N wine that looks like a heavy hand poured it , but hey , definitely not complaining . there is a good selection of food to satisfy everyone ' s palette . the assorted cheese plate is a must-have in addition to the cod mashed potatoes , and flatbread . the space isn ' t conducive for large groups and moreso better for intimate gatherings dates etc . there is not only table seating , but also bar seating as well if you wanted to keep it casual . 
such a popping place ! we came and were told that the wait was N-N minutes , but within N minutes we were told we had a table . we were all super excited about the meal - eggs benedict , poached eggs , brioche french toast and the luluc toast . everything was delicious ! all dishes were great of one person . and both toast dishes were great to share ! the only reason why i wouldn ' t come back is the services atmosphere . the place is . . . hustle and bustle . we were seated at the corner , right before you turn down the hall to the restrooms back yard seats and it seemed out of place . there was a lot of moving waiters who forgot to refill our coffee cup . just lacked that homey brunch feelings . whom whomp
wtf ? ! ? ! ! ! peanut butter and chocolate shake . for some reason i ordered this shake cause i was really thirsty with a really dry mouth . and ya . they gave it to me and it was amazing . it tasted like reeses pieces making love to peanut butter cups with bannanas in my mouth ! apparently its healthy too because its made with skim milk . i never like skim milk but i love this shake . skim milk , bannana , peanut butter and non fat yogurt . so i reccomend this shake to all not allergic to peanuts . also i had the carnitas with mediteranian style . the carnitas doesnt taste authentic . but the mediteranian twist was a good taste , so many possibilities with the menu that you can really customize the flavor of your burrito . cool place to sit and people watch when the weather is nice , they also have free wifi . which i know all yelpers love this , , , , 
i love their criollo fish dish its a big hit with any friend i bring along when i come to this spot . 
i think i have a new favorite brunch place . . . came here earlier today and order the poached eggs with roasted tomatoes and cheddar cheese grits . it also came with some sourdough toast . everything about it was perfect , the eggs were poached to the point where the yolk was slightly hardened and slightly runny , the cheddar cheese grits were not too heavy , the roasted tomato was warm and seasoned with oregano , the bread was toasted and buttered . . . altogether it was an amazing combo . my friend got the same thing and we both finished the entire thing . service was thoughtful and attentive , loved the dead animal heads all over , will definitely be back . preferably soon . 
the negative reviews all must come from the delorenzo die hards . yeah . it is better ! i have never , never had a problem with the service either . the mustard pizza with peppers and onion is original as it gets . and , the crust is awesome . delorenzos is good . but papas is better ! 
what a gem of a find ! my son-in-law had my daughters surprise birthday party here for our family . we were in the lovely back garden room on a sunday evening this summer . everyone was pleasantly surprised by the fabulous quality of the food as well as the generous portions . they also had a nice selection of well priced wines . just as important , the service was excellent . the owner who oversaw everything , as well as the staff were very accommodating and always pleasant . everyone said they would definitely go back for dinner on their own . i only hope i ' ll be able to get a reservation once this place is discovered ! 
the best burger in nyc ! it ' s very thick and fresh ! i am not a big fan of burgers but i did like it a lot . it ' s definitely worth waiting in a long line . 
this is the only chinese restaurant in the area that doesn ' t load its dishes with sugary , gooey crap . everything tastes fresh , and the presentation is also a step up from your average chinese hole . they ' re a bit slow with takeout orders . . . place your order like N minutes earlier than you normally would for chinese . 
the best . 
extremely nice service , very friendly . we wanted to get the best on the menu and we were provided with very honest answers , food was awesome and the price was quite reasonable . loved it and will be back again
i crave this . i ' ve enjoyed two meals from here in the past month and there will be many more happy ones to come . the honey green tea is amazing . the wraps are delish . the frites are like a drug . and the dips are the icing on the cake . the goat cheese wrap i ordered on my first trip was a bit lettucey for my taste but the hint of portabella made the whole thing worth it . i love how thin and tender the wrap itself is . the frites are just right . not too thin , not too thick . just a touch salty and crispy , but not crunchy . then there are all those dips . the basil is by far the standout of the four i ' ve tried so far . garlic and eggplant were good . mango chutney was surprisingly thin and forgettable . although i haven ' t tried them , the desserts are more then tempting . best of all ? a filling , satisfying , and flavorful dinner for around N . the only thing i would change ? charging a bit less for extra dips . N cents is just enough to prohibit me from ordering a second flavor with my small order . and it ' s hard to take risks when i know just how good that basil is . 
fancy mediterranean is the way to describe ilili ! the restaurant itself is modern with subtle lighting that makes the dining experience feel intimate yet spacious at the same time due to its higher ceilings and lots of diners ! i have been to ilili several times and each time the service has been excellent with the servers attentive and ready to help with suggestions . the food is always enticing and full of flavor . review of a couple of things we have had in the past - brussels sprouts- with fig jam , walnuts and grapes . . . . so yummy . i know this sounds like the weirdest combination but it really works . my husband who doesn ' t even like brussel sprouts loves them ! - falafel- comes in little squares , they are always very crispy and crunchy so if you like softer falafel ' s then these aren ' t for you ! - batata hara- fried spicy potatoes . . . . whats not to love ! i always appreciate the fact that after finishing the bowl of potatoes there isn ' t a little pool of oil at the bottom ! - mouhamara- i personally love this dish due to the sweetness of the pomegranate molasses and will order it wherever i find it ! if you don ' t like sweet dips then i would steer clear , but i feel this is one dip one should definitely try ! - hummus- good hummus , i ' ve had better but this isn ' t bad in the world of hummus ' s - rkaykat- cheese rolls , yum ! fried to crispy perfection and filled with gooey yummy cheese ) - chicken shish taouk- chicken is always tender and juicy ! it can get to be an expensive outing here but that ' s why i called it " fancy " mediterranean . it ' s a great spot for a date or just out with friends as they have the space . i have seen big groups here and plenty of couples ! so if you ' re in the mood for dressing up and feel like having mediterranean then definitely give this place a try ! its definitely worth checking out ! 
this place is amazing . the juicy pork buns are incredible . all the food is fresh and just delicious . the chow mien has all freshly prepared veggies in it . the general tso chicken are chunks of chicken . the house special fried rice is loaded with shrimp , pork and chicken . i truly cannot say enough about this restaurant . 
my friends and i went for a N hour bottomless brunch . N for an entree and unlimited drinks was an unexpected and awesome deal . the food was solid and italian themed with quality ingredients and generous portions . side note they refilled our drinks nonstop . we couldn ' t even keep track of how many we had . we will definitely be back ! 
now don ' t get me wrong , i thoroughly enjoy a healthy lunch option in center city as much as the next person . i even get , dare i say , excited . so when my friend kait suggested fuel for lunch today , after a quick peek at the menu , i was all for it . first looks at the place funky d cor , calorie conscience meals , hipster staff . . . . all signs pointed to a pleasurable experience . until i got back to work with my food . firstly , if spending N . N on a greek salad and starter of hummus was hard enough to swallow , to come to the realization that they are not being N truthful about their calories and that their portions are completely off sent me off the yelp edge . issue N the salad . the calorie count on the salads is before the dressing ( which everyone knows is the lions ' share of calories in a salad anyway ) . not to mention they give you a giant amount of dressing . this would be fine , if they disclosed that on the menu or told you how many calories is in their standard dressing portion . which they don ' t . which makes me angry . the only way i know it is before the dressing is that the N large cubes of feta ( N cals an oz ) on my greek salad alone is darn close the N calories total that they give you . add the heaping portion of vinaigrette they gave me , which definitely had olive oil in it ( another N cals tbsp ) . N cals ? sorry , try again . issue N the hummus . now i love hummus . i eat it , i make it , i put it on anything that i can possibly imagine to put it on . so when i saw the N calories total they had given it i knew that had to be including the pita that they served with it . i know from an obscene amount of personal hummus consumption that your run-of-the-mill , store-bought , not-even-trying-to-be-healthy hummus is , on average , N-N cals per N tbsp serving . knowing this , i opted for the vegetable option instead of the pita to shave some cals off that hefty N number . i was totally jazzed because there is nothing i love more than a slice of cucumber with a dollop of hummus and it ' s surprisingly hard to find places that give a veggie option . much to my surprise what i got was a bowl of hummus , N cucumber slices , and N red pepper strips . which means N things N ) the N number is before the pita ( which again they don ' t disclose or tell you how many calories is in their pita ) and N ) someone doesn ' t understand what a healthy portion of hummus is ( which is just a tad important ) . so if you are serious about counting calories i might skip this place or at least know that you have to add a good N calories to anything you eat here to be safe . for me , i think if you are going to pose as a health conscience establishment , have a conscience to start with . fool me once . . . . 
let ' s let the professionals speak on this one . in the Nth annual jersey choice restaurant poll the red eye caf won a critics ' choice in both the best coffee bar and best brunch in the state categories njmonthly . com articles r 
my family and i visited the shanty for dinner a few weekends ago and it was fantastic ! we were greeted upon entering the building which is always nice and welcoming , our server was friendly and attentive . our sons ate from the kids menu , my husband who is not a seafood lover had the chicken teriyaki , the chicken was nice and juicy . i love seafood so i went with the broiled seafood combo with homemade mac cheese ! everything was awesome ! can ' t wait to get back to burlington to go again ! 
my favorite lunch spot in town- fresh food , nice portions , and some damn good salsas . staff is nice . soft tacos are killer . the only downside is the breakfast burrito can be a little . . . . moist . . . otherwise , killer all around . 
this was our second time we have came for lunch . both times food was excellent . service was very very friendly and made sure every thing was made perfectly . 
if you ' re looking for excellent tasting ramen them look no further friendly staff a wide variety of ramen many toppings to put in the ramen staff yell at everyone ' s entrance ( i find this hilarious ) ambience is nice makes me feel like i ' m in japan
i came here because i ' m currently on a mission to find as many good buffalo wings spots as i can in nyc . bonnie ' s grill ' s menu stated that their buffalo wings come in N or N pieces with a choice of medium , hot or hotter sauce . i love my spicy stuff really hot so when it was time to order , i told them " give me the hotter wings or whatever is the hottest that you have . " the server looked at me and asked have i ever eaten their hottest wings before to which i replied no but i can eat really hot stuff . he looked at me again and said that he thinks i better stick to the hotter sauce that is on the menu . apparently there is a another hot sauce that they serve that is so hot that they keep it off the menu . ohhhh , secret menu stuff . that ' s so neat . wonder how many people knew it existed ? now i just had to try it . the server was apparently worried about my safety . aww , awfully nice of him . he gave me a small sample of the off the menu sauce and i guess he expected to see me cry or tear up or something . didn ' t happen . the way the server explained it to me , most people that ask for really spicy finds out that they can ' t handle it . when i told him it was bearable after tasting the sample , he then proceeded to make the hottest wings that they had for me . the wings were very good . crispy on the skin and moist where the meat was . it was also not too salty which some buffalo wings tends to be . i liked the secret sauce that they gave me but i must warn everyone it ' s a lot hotter then what most people could stand . definitely ask for a sample of the sauce before ordering the hottest off the menu wings . not as good as my beloved pluck u ' s buffalo wings ( although their hottest sauce is even hotter then pluck u ' s death sauce ) but it ' s close . the cheese that they used for the dip is disappointing . instead of a blue cheese dip , it tasted something like a very thick mayo sauce with a small hint of cheese in it . i also ordered fries on the side and have to say they were delicious . shoe string style with a nice crispy skin and soft interior . i ordered the small order and even that amount was so much fries that i couldn ' t finish it . the place is pretty small . there is a long counter space right in front of the cooks that takes up half the restaurant . the rest of the space is taken up by what i remember to be nine small N customers tables which they mix and combine for larger groups . on my way out they told me that the next time i ' m there , just remind them i was able to handle their hottest wings and they will make it for me . yep , i definitely would . heat level of the hottest buffalo wings from a scale of one to five , five being the hottest . N
i have been to mickey ' s quite a few times and have always had a good meal but my lunch on monday N N N was exceptional . i don ' t know if they have a new person in the kitchen but the lunch i had on monday was outstanding ! ! it was more flavorful then any other time i have been there and the presentation was lovely as well . i told marion my server to please let them know to keep up what ever it is they are doing and i look forward to going back . thanks ! 
good burgers . alamo bigger than my girlfriend ' s face . low key with some craft beers . 
just wanted some drinks and bar food , but the bar was full . one of the many hostesses was able to give us a table , but said she needed it back by N N . our server acted surprised we only wanted the bar trio and drinks , but didn ' t try to upsell . we got the burrata , lamb tenderloin , and garrotxa , the later being the star of the three , but they were all very good . there was some awkwardness with the abundant staff that i ' m sure will get worked out , but for now makes this three stars for me . we could see bobby flay cooking , and there was something sexy about that . i took a pack of matches from the big bowl they offered , a touch that i ' m happy to see making a comeback . 
great service and tasty food . the ambience is a killer . it ' s very spacious and trendy with clean lines . the open kitchen design is amazing . all the greenery around the restaurant gives it a bit of a romantic graden-like feel but without overdoing it . will definitely be back for more . 
fantastic ! ! ! ! best macaroons i have ever tasted . beautiful presentation , just superb . the expense is worth every penny . for my birthday i want a whole tower full these macaroons . i cannot wait to go back ! 
the food at kat ' e kreations is amazing ! we enjoyed the shrimp and crab cakes not to mention the toffee . the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly . definitely try it you won ' t be sorry . 
pat ' s and geno ' s got nothing on this place . stayed away from the tourist trap and headed to where the locals get their eats on ! they were right ! as you can see from the photos that are posted on each of these restaurants pages that you get these puny little steak sammies and p or g ' s . but at ish ' s the meat is over flowing and plentiful . i have seen other reviews stating that ish ' s meat is bland . mine was covered in cheese wiz . i had no complaints on the tastiness of the sandwich . the addition of their world famous fries with their gremlin drink ( lemonade and grape juice and you got one scrumptious meal that you don ' t have to wait in a huge line and get insulted if you don ' t order your food the proper way . 
bad service underwhelmed by the food
amazing food in a rustic looking tribeca restaurant . maybe not the most romantic of restaurants , but you ' ll fall in love with the food if not the person sitting in front of you . lamb meatballs , pastas and salads are all great . be prepared to plan way ahead ( one month ) or for a long wait at the bar . both are worth it ! 
the wife and i are regulars here since forever . food is consistently good , as are the cocktail specials . pro-tips show up early or late so you can avoid the crush . enjoy the music which is nicely selected . i love the goat cheese beet salad and the merguez sausage in particular . 
i came here multiple times since N . consistently very good food . service is ok . the wait can get long so be careful with timing . 
bad experience here . only for tourists in a rush note most of the reviews are from out of towners . we are not drinkers due to a medical condition . . . . so two of four of us werent drinking . this fact greatly irritated our server who kept awkwardly suggesting we get a bottle of wine though our two drinkers were quite pleased to sip cocktails through dinner . all of this culminated in a strange list of ordering restrictions that ended with a warning from the manager that if we share any pasta he will charge us all for pasta or take away silverware from those that didnt order pasta . . . it was so silly that i thought we were being punkd . but he was serious . . . so we left without eating . ive heard the food is ok if you ' re into pasta , but why bother dealing with the poor service for just above avg pasta . you ' re better off with convivio , del posto , travertine , nanni ' s , locanda verde , scarpetta or babbo if you ' re going to drop that kind of cash on italian in nyc . hard to believe batali ' s business partner is involved with this place . . . i hope out of towners go to the aforementioned places to spend their cash instead of becco . hope the folks at yelp post my thoughts and help the tourists find out what new yorkers already know . 
seriously love this place . pretty kitsch - in a good way - and the people are so nice . highly recommend
amazing ! ordered a variety of dishes - tuna sashimi , chilled tofu , salmon don , doughnuts , poached egg , dumplings , grilled cod , etc . favorites were the chilled tofu , salmon don and doughnuts ! was less of a fan of the cooked dumplings and cod . definitely preferred the raw foods ! overall , this place is a great japanese restaurant in midtown -- fresh food , great service , varied menu , and reasonably priced ! 
i wish yelp would give zero stars . the start of my problem was that i found a dead fly in my salad . this is something that happens , not a huge deal , but what happened after that is something i ' ve never encountered before . i showed my plate with the fly to my server to ask for a new one . the server apologized and took away the plate . to my surprise , he came back to me with another guy , perhaps the manager , and brought the plate back to my face , arguing to me that the black creature with legs and wings was not a fly , and that it was parsley ! my coworkers and i couldn ' t believe the situation and said , it ' s a fly , because it is ! and then this person took the piece of onion with the fly on from my plate , and ate it in front of us ! ! ! he looked straight at me while chewing it , smiling and saying " see ? it ' s okay , it ' s parsley ! " . by this point , my friends and i were both dumbfounded and furious . luckily the chef came into the room , also angry ( of course ! ) told him to stop as even he saw the fly and agreed that yes , it was indeed a fly . he then apologized and got me a new salad , but what a horrible experience . the owners of the restaurant needs to check their staff . what would the board of heath do to this restaurant if it new that its staff were trying to convince customers to eat food that had bugs in it ? unbelievable
i wasn ' t a big fan . you will have to deal with dirty streets , lack of parking , lots of tourist , and rude workers . . . . all to get a average cheesesteak at best . all their meat , onions , and peppers were chopped and in warmers , they don ' t melt the cheese on the sandwich . . . they just slop it together and shove it out the window . i will pass and pay less for a quality cheesesteak across town . 
love this place . cheap , friendly , super yummy . reminds me of the tacos you find in austin . a lot of thought was put into the flavor combinations . 
after reading the reviews comparing the king in astoria to these guys , this was obviously my next place to try in midtown . i ordered the chicken platter in order to get a good comparison . the chicken was good . i ' m pretty sure the chicken was thigh meat . very tender , nice flavor , but alone , it didn ' t excite my tastebuds . the guy tried to warn me that the hot sauce was hot . i didn ' t listen and told him to add some more , because i always think people underestimate how much i like spicy food . he was right though . it was hot , so don ' t get a lot or you won ' t be able to taste the food . the amount i got was pushing it . two squirts is enough . while soft and tender , the rice is an odd orange color . i haven ' t figured out why . they also throw in some lettuce and a ripped up pita . i prefer the king ' s addition of falafel . the pita just got soggy on the way back to my office with all of the steam and sauce . overall this place offers a good filling meal for a measly N and i ' d choose it over any other cart in midtown . the king of falafel and shawarma in astoria gets my vote for best in the city though . 
this review is for the brunch . a friend highly recommended this place and N of us met for brunch . as soon as she mentioned chilaquiles , i was sold . i love that stuff . however , when we sat down , the menu looked nothing like what was on the website . no chilaquiles . we asked the waitress and she coldly said " this is the new brunch menu . " the brunch menu was nothing like what was on the website . i settled for huevos rancheros , which was ok but nothing like traditional huevos rancheros ( and i ' m from new mexico ) . it was basically just a flat taco shell with an egg on top and some cheese in a sauce . pretty bad deal for N . the worst part was that my wife ' s food just did not come . no explanation . we had to go in and ask about it , and they said it was coming soon . about N minutes later we were all finished eating and she still hadn ' t received her meal . turns out our waitress never put the order in . they took it off our bill , in fairness to them , but it was a really bad experience for her not to be able to eat with the rest of us . i do not recommend you dine here due to the change in brunch menu and very poor service . 
nothing extraordinary
great artisinal pizza . okay service . 
excellent food , terrible service . it says it is family friendly , but it really was not . 
very good cuisine . i ' ve bumped into a few celebrities here which says something in itself ! 
i have tried sooo many ramen noodle places in california and nothing , i mean nothing compares to ippudo for my taste buds . they have perfected it . your ramen bowl is like a perfect storm . you ' ll know what i mean when you see it . the pork bun , wow . . . can ' t find any in california matching it either . the place does get crowded , from N-N hours wait . our wait time was N . N hours and you know what , it didn ' t bother us as we had some drinks at the bar and snacked on those yummy pork buns . we were brought to our table upstairs ( they have like a secret door ) - i would suggest you stay in the main room . the seating upstairs was bar-like and behind the glass is some stuff they have , very unsightly . but who cares if you have been waiting for hours , the food is more important ! i would definitely come back when i visit new york ! ! ! unless the owners decide to visit california ) and start one here ! 
wow , my N was simple , delicious , and cheap . very mom and pop . will definitely come again . 
meh . i ' ve experienced better is best way to sum up my experience . first off i probably made the mistake for going here with the intentions of having a nice , less loud dinner w my grilfriend during the october N restaurant week . i had limited expectations going here although i had heard from a bunch of friends that this place was good to great . i left feeling that i would not recommend this place to anyone unless they insisted on going there . so we started out with good appetizers , being the vermont cheddar and honey , along with the sauteed cauliflower w a black garlic sauce . it was tastey . the second set of dishes we shared were a buckwheat polenta and a chilled tomato soup w serrano ham . not a fan in slightest . and finally we had the scallops and a goat bolognese and the scallops were hard . . . . not done well and something i wouldn ' t expect out of a garces restaurant . goat bolognese . . meh . desserts were ok , doesn ' t help that my gf is a pastry chef and critiques them with great knowledge . so the macaron and greek probiotic yogurt was again not done well and the macaron was too airy and not soft enough . i hope other have a better experience than i did . 
i can hardly visit reading terminal market without stopping for a hershel ' s sandwich . i ' ve had the corned beef , brisket , and the pastrami . honestly , i can ' t decide which i like the best . they will all blow your face off in flavor and the meats are hand carved in front of you . they are then piled high on homemade rye bread and are served with N dill pickle spears . order any of them with mustard and onions . also , their reubens are probably the best i ' ve ever had ! the portions are huge , definitely save half to bring home . if you ' ve never been here , you don ' t know what you ' re missing out on . eat here and i promise you will not be disappointed . 
honeygrow is great-- affordable , tasty , and seemingly healthy . i say " seemingly " because there ' s no nutritional info posted anywhere in the store or on their website , so there ' s no real way to be sure . management please , please give us the info-- doesn ' t have to be a fancy calculator . a simple pdf with calorie counts for each ingredient will get you N stars from me ! 
i have had about N times their cobb salad , it ' s pretty good . i am upset that burger bound in kearny has closed . 
don ' t bother . . . the food is gross . 
this place has everything . and it ' s not just variety--you ' re talking high quality stuff for the old school and the nouveau foodie alike . 
this place was only so-so . there are many better mexican places out there . 
ok , i ' m not a street cart customer , however halal guys i can never resist , simply the best lamb over rice ! 
i will never go back and never recommend this place to anyone . today is the morning after our dinner and i am still floored by how rude our waitress was . i have never in my life been so disrespected . when i sat down at the table i did not have a place setting . naturally my friend asked if we could get an extra . her response in a very abrasive tone was " maybe you should look around harder " because there was one small tapas plate alllllllllll the way at the other end of the table . . . are you serious ? then she proceeded to serve evryone else wine , except for my friend and me , making it very obvious that she did not want to service us . only replenishing water to the left side of the table and left us with no service at all . ( i guess no service is better than her service ? ? ) of course she spilled wine on my friend and failed to excuse herself . . . the list goes on . . . it got to the point where i was actually worried that she was going to spit in our food ! ! ! when speaking to the manager he said he was sorry and was going to see to it . she continued being horrendous and the worst part was that since we were a party of nine the N tip was included ! ! ! ! ! ! ! for N this is the service you get ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? the manager didn ' t even have the courtesy to take anything off of our bill . . . . not one thing . as we left she was laughing looking right at us and told her coworker " whatever i was having fun with it " . a raging lunatic . i wouldn ' t go back if you paid me . 
the food is good , but it ' s literally all the same stuff . the chicken is all fried chicken tender crap with a different out-of-the-can sauce . it ' s quiet and clean , but the food is pretty sub par for chinese food . 
how the heck did this place get such rave reviews ? ! ? ! i ' ve been wanting to try this restaurant out because it ' s received such high marks here on yelp . but the other yelpers must ' ve never had good thai food before because joya is nowhere near up to par , and i ' m not saying that just ' cause my man and i were seated at the table right next to the stinky bathrooms . ( restaurants should be smart enough not to put tables right next to toilets , or at least people sitting at those tables should get N off their meals . ) we both ordered tom yum goong soup since it ' s one of our faves . you get a huge bowl , but it ' s a bowl of sugar and nothing more . no lemongrass , no spice ( even though it was really red ) , all sugar water . i suppose i ' ll give them half a point for at least using fresh mushrooms . i ordered the chicken pad thai as my entree , and , again , you get a huge portion . bigger is not better , people ! if it ' s not good , you still won ' t please me not matter how large you are . the noodles were drowning in sauce , and i wanted to drown my sorrows in some real thai food . my bf is less picky about his food than i am , and he wasn ' t pleased either . and i ' m not pleased that my bf was right about something . he ' s constantly annoyed that i have to yelp restaurants before i decide to eat somewhere . he said that just ' cause yelp says it ' s good or bad doesn ' t mean it is so . i trusted you yelpers , and this is what i get ? ? my bf ' s never going to let me live this down . . . 
great food . great delivery
been on the search for a good sushi place and this is it . the prices are cheap and the spider rolls are awesome . order from here all the time , and it ' s quiet and clean . 
while the pork buns are great and the ramen is decent , i have to say it doesn ' t quite live up to the hype or price . you ' re basically paying N . N for a bun with two pieces of pork and some lettuce . the sauce is delicious but not worth the price . i had the akamaru modern as recommended and felt it was decent but nothing to write home about , especially not for N . it ' s about as tasty as average ramen in tokyo and the toppings are overpriced . personally , i would recommend totto ramen over here . 
they ' ve got a new chef , and the chef has kept the staple menu items . not only that , the new chef has some pretty imaginative new specials ! i ' ve always been a fan of jose pistola ' s . ordered grouper tacos , which are my fav on the menu . they were more awesome than usual this time around , every flavor in them was delicious . i have to say , if they made the price N , i ' d pay it for N tacos , instead of N . N for two . the beer selection has been better , this recent night must have just been an off-night . then we tried something off the specials menu the spicy tuna guacamole . maybe not the most appetizing name , but certainly appetizing in taste ! and that ' s what matters , am i right ? i was super happy with this app . i love sesame seeds and i love spicy tuna . . . and of course , like every other human , i love guacamole . i ' ll be back more often , thanks for reminding me how delightful your food is ! 
ah , it turns out that after a handful of visits at each place , i am ultimately a frank pepe ' s fan . modern is still delicious and a treasure . but the past couple times , i ' ve not been impressed with the intensity of the char ( like , um , yeah , very burnt ) and also i don ' t know if it ' s the heavy-handedness with the grated cheese or if it ' s the sauce , but so salty . it ' s amazing stuff , but it seems more " hit or miss " while frank pepe ' s has been more consistent for us . 
asked for a plain bagel with plain cream cheese--received a plain bagel with very soft mushy butter--yuck ! been to other bagel shops and this one is lacking . 
closed every year from late december through early february . 
beer selection was alright but the staff was terrible . despite my best efforts i couldnt get a drink at the bar to save my life , the bartender walked by us and our empty glasses on multiple occasions . when it came time to pay our tab , just flagging down anyone who worked there proved difficult , we finally got the attention of one of the bartenders who asked my name and promptly left . she came back N minutes later only to ask my name again . the bar was not packed , i dont understand why everything was so difficult . the final nail in the coffin came as we were leaving , the bartender spilled an entire beer on my helmet and cell phone . i didnt get an apology , she just tossed me a dirty bar towel . i had to ride home with a helmet that reeked of beer , i dont know if i ' ll be able to get the smell out . there are too many other bars to waste your time at this one . 
lots of food , great value ! super authentic , and worth the long subway ride from manhattan . not much by way of ambiance , but it was comfortable . there was a cute little kid there and the staff was friendly . the tacos were good and i really liked the garnishes ( grilled onions , radish , lime , etc . ) that came with them . i ' d definitely come back for more tacos , though there are other places in brooklyn that i like more . 
this is one of the things i truly miss about working in parsippany . in the land of strip-malls and chain restaurants , this place is a real treat ! i used to go here for special occasions or on my parents ' dime when they ' d come visit and take me out to lunch . i am pretty sure the pastas are homemade and they are definitely toothsome , especially the eggplant ravioli and the gnocchi . fresh mozz appetizer was amazing as well . atmosphere is nice once you get inside , and the service was very professional and attentive . 
i am writing this review after visiting the restaurant for the second time . interestingly my negative experience preceded the positive one i had today . i was convinced by my friends to give it a second chance , and i am glad i did . the first visit was right before thanks giving with my family . we were seated in a drafty part of the restaurant , ignored by waitstaff , and our food arrived way after the food of others who ordered after us and who appeared to have had ordered similar dishes . that set aside , the food was decent , except it all came out at different times , which was strange . by the time the rest of my family ' s food came out mine was cold . that ' s no fun , especially for someone who works in a restaurant and understands why there is never an excuse for this happening . this experience alone is a N or a N star event . today , however , my experience was relaxing . i went in alone and was greeted with a pot of delicious herbal tea , which i enjoyed until my pho special ( typical pho with an assortment of beef balls , and various cuts of beef ) arrived . all of the accouterment ( sprouts , basil , jalepeno , lime wedges ) were fresh and allowed me to experiment with the taste throughout the meal . this experience alone is a N or N star event . for me a good bowl of pho is an elixir . i left nam phuong rejuvenated today . my advice is to go during off hours in a small group . long live affordable vietnamese cuisine ! cheers ! 
incredible food . especially for us gluten-free customers . only downside is the seating is limited and tightly packed . 
simple and yummy . a slice is a meal itself but the cheesecake is super creamy and rich . must visit the original location in brooklyn bc they have more selection and everything is baked on site . 
best happy hour in the city and what an amazing cocktail menu . i love their lychee martinis but they also have a huge cocktail menu and various infused vodkas that they make themselves . the asian appetizers are sooooo good . it really is the perfect place - delicious cocktails , asian appetizers , great prices and very laid back but sexy atmosphere . 
i came here for restaurant week and for once i ordered off the rw menu . everything here was delicious . the rw menu was a great value , especially in combo with the foursquare discount . watermelon salad - light and refreshing . this was my first time eating yellow watermelon . grilled brook trout with green bean casserole - very moist and flaky fish with nicely done green beans and crispy onions . raspberry ice cream sandwich - delicioso . 
i ' ve been to zavino several times now , and had such a great experience with each visit that i feel i must " yelp " it out loud ! the ambiance is a wonderful juxtaposition , presenting a relaxed feel of a local pizzeria with a sophisticated and modern twist . the service is always friendly and inviting , and above all - knowledgeable . whenever i have a question about potential dinner or drink choices , the server bartender take their time to explain why a certain wine will be better paired with a particular dish . and then , of course , there is the food . simply put - the best oven pizza i ' ve had in the city . the chefs clearly express their culinary creativity by presenting daily specials ( which could be found on the chalk boards at the bar ) . the staples that are found on the main menu are always a hit . i just love the spinach pizza . and being able to see your pie being made in the oven just adds to the dining experience ( at least for me ) . overall , simply put - a great place to enjoy a nice meal and drinks . 
wasn ' t really wowed by their ramen--the broths were salty or just not something i found all that great . the pork buns , though far from traditional . . . was quite good and would probably go back just for those they have a ever so slight kick vaguely similar to korean spicy pork , and the sauce which i guess was kind of like an aioli almost was a big hit with some of the people on the table . 
i feel soooo lucky to have this goldmine right near my apartment but oh man i ' ll have to force myself not to go too often . i went a few times last summer for some outdoor wine and cheese ( how can you go wrong ? ! ) but when the weather got colder , i forgot about it . tonight though , i decided to go back and actually get dinner and i was blown away . the ambiance was awesome decorations included framed wine openers and rustic paintings . the service was perfect well-informed guidance with choosing wine and the right balance between checking in and letting us dine . the food ( split ricotta honey truffle bruchetta , gorgonzola walnut and pear salad , and pesto shells ) made you feel like you were actually in italy or at least eating out because even friends who are good chefs could not have made food this good . basically , i ' m in love . 
murph ' s is a fun and relaxed place to drink a pitcher . has an old-time vibe and friendly bartenders . 
more expensive than an authentic steak house , worse than outback . as vermonter who lives in manhattan , i wasn ' t expecting a peter luger ' s experience last night at eb strong ' s , but with steaks approaching N . N and side portions at N . N , one would expect a bit more than what was presented . in manhattan where N . N an entree is expensive regardless of your income , the quality of meat you get is exceptional and sides are overflowing on piping hot plates . steaks are aged for N years and a porterhouse is served sliced perfectly by impeccably trained waiters deeply familiar with everything on the menu . at eb strong ' s , burlington ' s attempt at a ny steak house , the mark is terribly missed . i can honestly say that i have had a better steak at outback on dorset street and the baked potato i ordered last night might as well have been put in a microwave . everything about this place was wrong and unless you are going there to try burlington ' s newest restaurant to " get it out of the way , " there is no reason to go . the bill exceeded N . N for four people and the best part of the meal was the free bread . a complete waste of money . 
a few friends and i tried to eat at little owl , but they didn ' t have a four top table , so the host recommended that we check out their sister restaurant , market table . he even called and reserved a table for us so it was ready when we arrived a few minutes later . i started out with the special for the evening , the leek and potato soup , and it was to die for . just the right consistency , not too thick , and the mixture of potatoes , mushrooms and leeks was perfect . for my entree i had the halibut and it was just as good as the soup , and beautiful to boot . i couldn ' t make it to dessert , but they had a polka dot cheesecake that sounded really good , i ' ll have to try it next time . it was a bit pricey at about N a person ( without drinks ) , but i can easily say that the service , atmosphere and food at market table were well worth the money . 
not bad . place new in north brunswick
i had heard and read numerous great reviews about clinton street baking company , so i thought it would be a great place to try for brunch when my mom was in town visiting . we had a great brunch ! we went on a sunday around N N am and had to wait for about an hour . we were prepared to wait , and really were not in much of a rush so we decided to just stick it out and wait . they use a text messaging system that shows you where you are in line and then contacts you when your table is ready , so you could easily leave and come back if wait times are long . we tried the blueberry pancakes , clinton st . omelette , and sugar cured bacon . everything was so delicious ! the pancakes come with maple butter , which adds a very tasty sweetness to the pancakes . the omelette , which we ordered with swiss cheese and mushrooms as the fillings , was also very tasty . the two of us split the meal , and we left satisfied . everything is very light , but still filling . clinton street baking company is a great spot in les ! they also have a selection of bakery and pastries for take out , such as muffins , scones , and cakes . they serve breakfast all day , so to avoid the long breakfast and brunch lines have some pancakes for dinner ! 
this place has a great looking menu which i hope to work through over the next couple of months . everything on the menu has some sort of flourish without being too exotic . so far i ' ve had the onion soup , cauliflower mash , barbequed tempeh with polenta and bison burger . ( N ) complicated enough food that i probably couldn ' t cook it at home . ( N ) cheap enough to go regularly . ( N ) atmosphere nice enough to go for a special occasion . reminds me of audrey claire . 
knowing how difficult it is to get a table at st . anselm , my friend and i decided to give it a try at about six pm the friday after thanksgiving . incredibly , the place was packed , but the hostess took our cellphone number and we went next door to spuyten duvil for a beer , where we ran into one of the charming managers , andy chang . just a few sips into our beer , we got a text that our table was ready . they told us via text that we could bring our drinks in through the back door . nice touch . our food was fantastic . grilled tomato and burrata--incredible . my friend wanted bread , but i was fine without it . we had the mushroom special , spinach gratin , fried truffled mashed potato and the butcher steak . it was so much better than thanksgiving dinner ! 
for the price , its not bad , but i did expect a little more . the fried buns were not crispy , bordering on soggy ( and i went during a dinner hour , where it shouldn ' t have been sitting around for a while ) . the dumplings in soup however , were very good . . . in a clear soup ( seemingly light on the msg ) with some asian vegetables and plump dumplings with a slightly chewy skin . i also had the sesame pancake with duck , which i wish was a little warmer and have a little more meat ( for N , it was still a steal ) . there ' s limited seating , so you have to hover a little to snatch a spot when someone leaves , although its not a place you would really want to stay long in anyways , as the air is full of the grease that ' s in your food . a decent cheap eat , although you ' re in chinatown , so i would probably pay a few dollars more ( literally , only a few dollars ) for a greater increase in quality . 
this is as good as it gets . whenever i have friends in town , this is the place that i take them to . danny meyer hits all the right notes with the conception of this restaurant . the braised pork loin and belly is probably one of the best things i have ever tasted . extensive wine list for any wine connoisseur . went there last week with some business associates and it being their first time , fell in love with the place . service is impeccable from the instant one walks in and the place runs like a well oiled machine . prices are up there however you wont mind paying for the quality . this place has been a staple of mine and will continue to be . this is what all restaurants should strive to be . 
awesome ! very yummy . scallion pancakes , crab and pot dumplings . so good ! ! 
went here on super bowl sunday . was a slow night . the food and service was excellent . had a wonderful time with the staff and the food was to die for . my husband had the duck and i had the rack of lamb . couldn ' t tell you which was best . the desserts were very good too . and the price is good . you have to try it out . 
rude , would never go there again . don ' t go waste your money in this establishment
i really enjoyed this place ! half of our party was late for our reservation , but we were still seated right away , and brought drinks and a snack we didn ' t even ask for . the wait staff is excellent and timely . if i could complain i would say the appetizers took a little longer than i would have hoped for , but it only built up my appetite even more , which was well worth the wait . food and drinks were very good and filling . price is reasonable worth it . the atmosphere and crowd varies from couples , to families to parties . they have a bloody mary bar which was fun ! funky little place ! 
leone ' s--what a fabulous place ! ! ! last night was the first time that i had the pleasure of eating there , as i ' m new to montclair . i was first attracted to the place by the outdoor seating that they have , which i was told is brand new after the construction of a beautiful , wide walkway out front . i sat outside , which was delightful . . . and was immediately brought a basket of bread with olive oil . . . yummm . i ordered the lasagne , which was delivered prompty by my waitress , who was friendly , attentive , and just downright pleasant . the manager even came over to my table to check how i was doing ! nice people . the lasagne was delicious . i would definitely order it again . overall , a great experience ! i plan on going back really soon . great people , great location , great ambiance , great food--what more could you want ? 
great food . great prices . grilled salmon very good . pad thai and peanut sauce bomb . pad see new chicken simply . great choice for a night out with awesome friends . . . 
my husband and i generally go here every sunday for the lunch buffet . we find the food to be very flavorful , and the staff is friendly . we also enjoy the fact that they mix it up with the menu from week-to-week so it ' s not the exact same fare every time we go . my only " complaint " would be that the chicken is sometimes dry . other than that , it ' s a favorite ! 
the food is delicious - really authentic afghani , middle eastern and turkish taste . the dishes are huge , very filling . the environment wasn ' t the best as far as fitting a restaurant description . it was more like a grab , eat and go kind of place . they lost N star though because their waiters were not friendly and kept sighing every time we asked for another drink or paper towels . not cool but i ' d suck it up and deal with that for good food i guess . can ' t have your cake and eat it too these days , as i see ! 
trendy , hip , lively place . great volcano roll ! ! and i had the octopus salad which was good as well . small affordable plates . creative menu . i want to come back and try so many of the menu items . service was just okay though . 
we went here for my girlfriends birthday on a thursday night . they say it is tough to get a reservation at this place so we called a week or so in advance and we got a N N reservation . we showed up N minutes late . the host did not have a problem with that , he knew who we were as soon as we walked in the door , i thought that was cool . we were seated at a decent table , they took our drink order and told us to just hang out until we were ready to order , no rush . our waitress came and we ordered , she was very nice as was the hostess . we had some calamari for starters , she had the sea bass special and i had the haibut , both were equally really good . we had a dessert , i forget what it was but it was good , some kind of tart . not sure you can go wrong with the food , everything seemed to be done perfect and you can see they took time in preparing it . i thought the place was going to be pricey but it was not so bad . they serve only beer and wine and i don ' t think they hammered us too bad on either , which was nice of them . the music is good , lighting good , the people who work there definitely made the place very real . i would go back for sure , great for special occasions and i am sure if you took a date there you would do well post date . ) 
the young who makes my burrito is very sweet ( everytime i go ! ) he ' s wonderful . the manager is pretty intimidating and doesn ' t come off very friendly . as for the food , it ' s a solid choice ( cheap and tasty ) . it ' s way better than moes ( on route N ) . plus you get free chips if you check in ! can ' t beat that
love the food and the restaurant . gotta come grab a bite if you happen to be in the soho area . 
food is ok , u need to know what to order . its true what everyone says the service is horrible , its like the staff is doing it to spite the owner . i think if the owner knew that he would be very dissapointed . probably all round dining expierence would improve if a change was made there . 
the chicken parmigiana sandwich is great . nice crispiness to the chicken and good sauce . 
horrible service , especially from a very rude manager wearing a blue shirt . refused to tell his name , was responsible for sitting arrangements . place is overloaded , way above capacity , and the staff cannot keep up . called ahead , they told me there is no wait . arrived N min later - N min wait . avoid in all cost ! ! ! they were seating people one on top of another , constantly requesting guests to move , so the waiters will go back and forth . not to mention the lady with a walker they requested to walk N stairs ! rude , with N customer service . 
this review is for drinks music , unfortunately haven ' t had a chance to try dinner here . i absolutely love this place . the decor is definitely N ' s speakeasy . when you enter the bellhop greets you takes you to the restaurant . i came here for a friends birthday we went over to listen to the heathen ' s perform . the music was great , the artists here are talented . also when they switched to the dj , i really appreciated the N ' s music . i had a great night here will definitely be coming here again . 
i went here for the first time for brunch with a couple friends over the weekend . made reservations through yelp open table , which worked out perfectly . basically this place has an impressive selection of brunch items , and the prix fixe cost is a great deal at N . i found my croque madame and bellini to be highly enjoyable . the room was a little dark with clubby pop music that was maybe a little too loud , but it wasn ' t too bad . the bathroom was clean . we liked it . 
this is a wonderful italian pizza place with great foods ! great service as well ! 
nicks is hands down the best roast beef your gonna get in south philly . such a great spot to get a couple drinks and enjoy some games . very cool atmosphere and cool people working here . you should definitely give them a try if your ever in the area
this place was amazing . great sandwiches ( i had the pork belly , and it was melt-away tender ) , but what sets the place apart are the loaded kimchi fries . they were unlike anything i ' ve ever had before . crazy delicious . we also sampled the chicken wings . they have a soy-garlic glaze that is really something special . we left stuffed and happy . 
came back to give taste good another try . i ' d like to start off by saying that the waitresses are very patient , accommodating , and honest about the food . my girlfriend is a vegetarian and they were helpful in making sure her dish was vegetarian friendly . i told them about her concern with the use of an unclean wok that was used to cook meat , and we were told they always wash the wok after using it . she had ordered the indian mee goreng without the seafood , but then the waitresses had realized it contained some kind of seafood sauce . it was brought out to us , but immediately removed from our table and double-checked of the ingredients with the chef . it turns out this dish wasn ' t able to be made vegetarian , so they replaced those noodles with vegetable chow mein lo mein with no questions asked . great service . i had the hokkien style char mee . it was good , but not something i loved . i don ' t have any others to compare it to , so maybe it just wasn ' t something of my preference . the place was busy on a saturday night at N N pm with a short wait , and many people picking up food , but i ' m still not convinced that this is the place to go for malaysian cuisine . 
service is not good . staff is friendly . food is not of great quality . might as well stay home . 
what a shame . brought my family to philly for the holidays and wanted to try out this establishment . what a shame to see the racism in this place . people were so rude , we left and went to jim ' s at N south st . they didn ' t want my dollars , so i would never eat here nor would i recommend anyone do so either . what a shame . . . 
i have a love hate relationship with reading terminal market . . . more specifically . . . i hate the crowds and everyone else knowing how amazing it is . it has every option you could possibly want for lunch . from cheesesteaks , greek , thai food , mexican , and a salad bar . fair warning fridays the terminal is insanely crowded . if you are not a tourist , i ' d avoid it unless you love crowds and people walking around aimlessly with no clue where they are going ! 
i ' ve been coming to peaches since it was a byob establishment and the food and service at that time was awesome ! now the service is crap . the last time i was here a few weeks ago we had a waiter with a poor attitude . he took forever to bring condiments and he said nothing when i mentioned all the flies in the area . why is there a swarm of flies in the restaurant to begin with ? i ordered " the lewis " dip which is nothing more than spinach dip and it came to the table watery . i sent it back and of course the water was poured off so now the dip was dry and not creamy at all . the swarm of flies got into it and i had the waiter take it back . and the shrimp . . . so mushy . one would think peaches is buying the lowest quality of farm raised shrimp possible . this is not the first time i ' ve had gummy mushy shrimp at peaches . this also was an issue with a po boy sandwich i had as well . word of advice peaches stop having such a high turn over rate in staff and serve better quality food . 
as a lover of italian food and culture , i am in love with eataly . i wandered throughout the store but was really only there for the gelateria , but the rest of the shops within eataly were amazing . i can only really speak to the quality of the gelato , which i must say is the best i ' ve ever had . i have had a lot of gelato during my N month internship in new york and eataly was definitely the best because it was the most authentic . other gelato places were too much like soft serve , but eataly serves authentic gelato like you would expect in italy . i had the raspberry and white peach ( or maybe white pear , either way it was amazing ) and the flavors really complemented each other . i would highly recommend a trip to eataly . chocolate is good , too . amorino near nyu is pretty good , also good raspberry but was more similar to soft-serve for chocolate and vanilla flavors . however , you can ' t go wrong at eataly ! ! 
love the stuffed breads ! ! ! ! ! also eat lunch here at least once a week . . . in my opinion it the best pizza in hamden . . . 
i park in front of almond all the time at night and it always seems empty . however we went for brunch on sunday and it was packed ! get a reservation on open table or be prepared to wait . we waited a while for a table and food but it was worth it . the food was great and very interesting too . a bit on the expensive side and being a picky eater i had to make my own standard N eggs , potatoes , toast and bacon meal based on the a la carte menu . the space is incredible . open large , nothing like most nyc places . there is a pool table in the side room and the decor is just beautiful . i will def come back for more brunch and dinner at some point . 
this place was terrible . N of went there for lunch and N of us would never go back . the place is messy and looks dirty . the food was the blandest i ' ve ever had . we had read some decent reviews so we had high hopes and were extremely disappointed . truly cannot understand how anybody would think that food was anything more than what you would expect at a soup kitchen ( actually that may be an insult to soup kitchens ! ) . perhaps we just went on a bad day , but i doubt it . 
new moon is my go-to in burlington for several things . if you ' re familiar with the church street area , you know there are a bunch of options for coffee , soup , sandwiches salads . . . even mini-cupcakes . it can be difficult t figure out where to get the best deals . let me tell you , new moon beats them all ! their coffee is legit , it will pick up your energy any time you have the need . for the winter months , it ' s comforting to grab a nice hot cup and relax by the fireplace . i especially like their cold-press iced coffee in the summer , and take it to-go while running errands downtown . their soups are made right there and the sandwiches are yummy . i prefer the salad bar , where you can have them whip up a custom mix of top-notch ingredients while you watch . my husband i sometimes get a large and it is big enough to share . the atmosphere is peaceful and the wi-fi is great . it is my favorite place in burlington for a casual meeting . oh yeah , about the mini-cupcakes . . . there may be other spots that claim they have good ones . once you ' ve tried the new moon creations , you ' ll shun the others . . . they are really that good ! ! ! 
so pumped that this place opened just steps from my apartment . it is a great addition to the lower east side . i am a huge fan of their chicken and waffles , and love that they now have breakfast all day . good drinks too . my favorite after work spot , especially for summer . . . thanks to the open-air setup , good grub , and friendly people who work and hang there . yay for the derby ! 
had the cheese steak and thought it was excellent
i ' ve had the pleasure of eating at mistral quite a few times since it opened earlier this year in princeton . i ' ve had consistently good experiences and my wife i love the thoughtfulness of the menu and the exceptional quality of everything we ' ve ordered . the tapas style plates are inventive and taste great . i had lunch at mistral yesterday with three guests , and it was another great culinary experience . and our waitress , masha , did a great job guiding us in our selections . i highly recommend this restaurant , you won ' t be disappointed . ron lauren b . davis
came here w N other people and sat in the upstairs area , which was super cute and cozy . my boyfriend and i got the veggie combo for N and our friend got something w lamb . the veggie combo was ok- some part of it were good and others just ok , none of it was awesome- the injeera seemed kind of stale and cold . we love our ethiopian food and this was just alright . the service was good and the overall experience was pleasant but didn ' t make up for meh food . the search for a good philly ethiopian spot continues-
N things i learned while eating here N . it ' s f cking amazing how many ways you can cook meat and have them all taste unique and delicious ( and get the puff pastry app sorry , my serbian isn ' t what it never was mediterranean salad ) N . my geography is shit . N . native serbians take forever in the bathroom . overall a wonderful unexpected experience . i recommend bringing your unshaven , ill-looking , brooklyn-douche , vegan friend and watch them squirm throughout the dinner for an added laugh . and try that fermented plum shit - it will drop you . 
i take my N year old mother to mcflys every sunday along with onne or two of my siblings and friends . i ' ve been at least N times and honestly can ' t complain abou this place . the staff is absolutely wonderful , attentive and knowledgable about the menu . we have never had to wait for a table fornmore than N minutes , and the menu is huge and diverse . . . . appetizers , especially the meatballs are to die for . salads have always been fresh and sandwiches were a hefty portion , very generous . i don ' t go to mcflys for the bathrooms like some reviewers are complaining about - i go to enjoy a relaxing time with my family who drive up from hamden to join us most weeks . we are never rushed and the servers are great with my mother ( who needs her meals asap since she has an incredible appetite ! ) go and enjoy this new restaurant and give it a chance . one or two bad experiences is not fair to a place that has just opened . . . . i think it ' s great . 
delicioso ! co o they so nice to me ! 
perfection . all i really need to say . 
bar used to be the favorite of all time but after horrible customer service at bar , modern is now the place to go ( N min away ) at least once a month . the customer service doesn ' t compare to bar which is a good thing . they are quick and there to take care of their customers , wouldn ' t even consider going to bar anymore after seeing a business ran the way it should be
quick overview food a , service f . therefore , N stars for swine . we had a party of N with a reservation on a saturday night . we all had the burger which was fantastic . i ' d agree with other reviews that you couldn ' t taste the bone marrow but hey , it was still an awesome burger . we also had the pork belly app ( amazing ! ) and the foie gras which was about how you would expect foie gras to be - delish . now onto the service . . . we were seating right away but the tables were right next to the bar so it was super loud . we could barely even talk to each other . after we were seated , we did not see a waiter or waitress for a good N minutes . literally nobody came to even bring us water . we finally got a waiter who got our drink order . i ' ll skip the rest of the timeline but it was a very long meal when we should have been there for about half the time . i ' m still glad i got to try the food because it was so good but i doubt i would be back - i ' d be more interested in trying new places in the area with better service . 
disgusting old food , and cheap alcohol . . . there is a reason why this place is cheap . . . 
fyi they have closed until they get a liquor license . it ' s too bad because it ' s my favorite place in williamsburg . 
i like their brooklyn pizza , so i used go there some times for that . one day i gave them N bill to get two slices of brooklyn , got less change back . guy in the counter with think accent said , " my friend you gave N bill , i can check in camera " . i said go for it . this guy was very rude and accused me , instead of saying sorry to me . i am sure if there was an american in the counter he she would have said sorry or it wouldn ' t have happened since we announce louder like " N out of N " , that ' s good practice . after that he delayed my food purposely for just N slices to worm up . after waiting for N mins , i noticed people who came way after me getting their slices . so went back to counter asked for my food , he got so mad , and said " my friend , you will get your food ok ! , you have to wait " . i felt so insulted in front of other customers at the counter , since then decided to not go there ever . i like their food though
the only great thing about this place is that the fish is super fresh . . . other than that nothing special . . . . nothing but oil and oregano and extra limes on the side . . . this doesn ' t describe perfection . . . definitely not worth waiting for a table specially in nyc
this place is a hidden gem , and i ' m so happy i found it ! when a coworker recommended it , i was like " it ' s just soup . . . so what ? " but i went once and knew i ' d soon become a repeat customer . everything about this place is great . the employees are actually friendly , prices are reasonable , and the food is fantastic . i love that it ' s a no frills place that prides themselves on their quality . how refreshing in this city . 
great brussels sprouts , burger , beer flight , and flatbread ! great tavern ambiance and lots of young professional types . loud overall but still fun and lots of energy . 
stopped in for munches on fat tuesday and had a great time . the service was outstanding and the atmosphere very cozy . we will be going back . 
food was ok - not worth the - had a reservation for N - we were rushed in and out - very rude waiters waitresses - took the food away while we were still eating had our family from out of town - they were not impressed at all ! ! and not worth the N , N bill . lots of other great restaurants to go to and be treated much better- will never go again
awesome food . . . i love the tawa rotis . . . they do not get any better . . love the karela-okra fry . . . the mutton curries . . . the chicken curries . . . and kababs . . . i prefer eating fish the way it is made in mangalore . . but after eating the amritsari fish curry at punjabi rasoi . . . it was finger licking good . punjabi rasoi is the place to head to if you are looking for home-made punjabi food . 
the food is half decent however the customer service amongst the worst i have been subjected to . the cashier was barely attentive during the ordering process and i was treated to a sarcastic " thank you with a fake smile " . avoid completely if you are looking for assistance with the menu and or a flavorful meal ! 
the chicken and rice is really good late at night after drinking ! 
most legit mexican food i ' ve come across in ny so far . it was packed on a thursday night but we were lucky and got two bar seats right away . everyone was ordering the tacos but i decided to go against the grain and ordered the sopas which i thought were like tacos but with a handmade tortilla . don ' t be stupid like me . . . definitely go for the tacos . all the ingredients tasted really fresh on the sopa - the chicken was juicy , not dry and the lettuce was fresh and crispy but i definitely will order the tacos next time . my bf raved about the pork tacos that he got . the guacamole was also very creamy and portion size was good . everything was on the cheap too , we had dinner here ( N sopas , N tacos and guac ) for a total of N incl tip ! so awesome . the most expensive thing was the guac which was N . also had la dodgers paraphernalia all over the place , i ' m not a fan of the dodgers but it was nice to have a little piece of california over here on the east coast . 
went to almond for brunch today and had a lovely , low fuss meal . we walked straight up around the time it opened ( Nam ) and got a table for N outside . it was a beautiful morning and so we were very happy . it ' s really nice to have a good brunch without the anxiety of knowing when or whether you ' ll get a table . we were probably lucky with the outdoor tables ( there ' s probably N or so outdoor tables ) but almond has quite a large capacity inside so i would expect that getting a table fairly quickly would be the norm if you ' re not fussed as to whether you ' re indoors or outdoors . i had the croque monsieur with tomato which was yummy and just so huge - you could definitely share it between N i think . my husband had the omelette and was happy with his also . the best bit about the whole experience was the complimentary scones ( perfectly baked ) and accompaniments - yumbo ! service was also efficient so no complaints there . we will return . 
i love yakitori and so does anthony bourdain . that makes me a food critic , right ? eh . well i try . the food the place seems to specialize in chicken - the logo makes that obvious . had the chicken skewers - thigh , gizzards , liver , heart , skin ( yes , really ) . all very different and delectable . loved the liver and the gizzards too . must try . other skewers - kobe beef , garlic . skip the beef - too ordinary - instead , order more chicken . the garlic is a good complement to other skewers . yaki don ( sp ) was a good way to fill up , where the flavors of the grilled chicken is soaked into the short grain rice . solid dish . service was typical japanese - quick , polite , efficient . definitely the best tsukune i ' ve had in the us . give the tontoro ( pork neck ) a try . . . . . 
recently went here after not going for many years . last time the old chipped chairs , stained walls , and worn out rug was a total turn off . guess what--still the same decor ! husband enjoyed his dinner and liked the salad bar . the only thing i could stomach was mushroom soup , which was very good with large chunks of mushroom . i wish the owner would renovate the place and put in a new rug . if a place doesn ' t look clean , i question what the kitchen is like . i ' ve heard the food is good , so one day hope to learn that they renovated and i ' d go back . 
excellent store but just too damn expensive ! 
so just came back from jose tejas . so far my fianc and i have tried their burros ( chicken an beef ) , and fajitas . they also serve chips and salsa . the salsa is fresh and amazing ! the chips good too . i had the red sangria and after two glasses , definitely a nice buzz . why four stars ? they don ' t take reservations or have call ahead seating . this means they have a N minute wait for a table for two on a sunday . we would take out but it is not offered ! 
i didn ' t actually eat here but if you love sangria , this is the place to go . i went here with friends after work one day . three of us split a pitcher of sangria--some of the best i ' ve ever had , and i ' ve had alot ! the best part is it comes with stuffed olives and bread on the side . all that for N ! and each of us had N-N glasses each . why are you still reading this ? go drink sangria ! ! 
authentic mexican cuisine with very reasonable prices . it is like an american-mexian diner . i recommend it for breakfast and lunch . 
an awesome pizzeria italian restaurant with wonderful ambiance inside and punctual , polite delivery drivers if you don ' t feel like leaving the house . my personal reccomendation the pollo pazzo . it ' s to die for . 
they serve halal meat . we stopped by for a lunch while in philly . their gyro is good both chicken and lamb . i recommend this place . 
came here for my birthday dinner , and was totally impressed . the service was great , and very helpful . had a great bottle of white wine and loved the intimate feel of this lic spot . one of the better meals i ' ve had in nyc . 
i went in hoping to get a lovely , fresh green juice . i ordered " the hulk " which is supposedly freshly pressed with spinach , cucumber , apple and lemon . it ended up being a few leaves of spinach , a few chunks of cucumber , and probably N apple juice from the fridge . and , surprise it just tasted like apple juice . extremely disappointing . on the plus side , customer service was fine . 
elaini has always provided us with personalized service . . the food is fresh and made to order . . . all the times my husband and i have eaten at her establishment we have never been disappointed in the food she makes . delicious ! elaini always has a smile on her smile . authentic greek food the way it should be . . keep up the good work
great diner , i can feel the love in the food , cocktail are superb , great friendly service
zero stars . as a life-long southern girl who has lived in the city for N years , i have been waiting for the perfect crawfish boil locale to open up . this place is definitely not it . if you think that paying these prices per pound for boiled crawfish is even somewhat acceptable , you have lost your mind . i myself generally eat N-N pounds ( because i know how to do it ) , so consider that and you ' re left with a pretty hefty bill . get a life , you losers who own this place . your boil isn ' t even tasty and my grandmother would be ashamed that you ' re selling this crap . not to mention the clientele that ' s lingering around outside is absolutely embarrassing . do yourself a favor save what you would spend on N dinners at the boil and buy a roundtrip ticket to nola . go pick up N pounds of boiled crawfish and potatoes corn at zimmer ' s and save yourself the embarrassment of being one of these clowns waiting around for a table outside . 
came here for lunch and the entrance it was very welcoming . i was disappointed that they didn ' t have as much of a variety on the lunch menu . the portion size is huge ! you definitely need to go there with an entire group . the food was just ok , not great not bad . our server was attentive but brought me wine in a juice glass . found that very strange . for a well known restaurant how could he not know which glass is for what . i ' m not sure if i would go there again , it ' s not at the top of places i would revisit . 
mmm mmm good
every time my father-in-law visits philly , he requests that we have brunch at parc . i suspect the pictures of naked ladies in the mens ' room might be the reason , and i don ' t mind indulging the old guy . as such , i have had more experiences dining here than i would like . the ambiance and location beside the park obviously remain the same , but i have noticed a steady downhill slide in food quality and service over the last few trips . the food had always been overpriced for what it is ( especially at brunch when " what it is " is eggs ) , but has historically been quite tasty . i always overlooked the fact that it was usually so tasty due to mass quantities of butter and salt . on our most recent trip , our party of five waited over twenty minutes to get the coffees we ordered . after they arrived , it was another thirty minutes to get our brunch entrees . fortunately , they were happy to keep providing our table with N pastry baskets in the meantime . when the entrees arrived , the two french toasts looked pretty good , but all three egg dishes were cold . my omelet , in particular , consisted of an overabundance of lukewarm rubbery egg wrapped around still-damp , cool spinach and goat cheese . the accompanying potatoes would have been awesome served hot , but were just a greasy mess at room temperature . since my in-laws were happily digging into their french toast , i did my best with the omelet , but ultimately left most of my meal on the plate . if this had occurred at a cheap , greasy spoon diner , the experience wouldn ' t have been too bad . however , we ended up paying close to N with tip for five people to have eggs , french toast , coffee and no drinks . i wish i could vow never to brunch at parc again , but my father-in-law made three trips to the restroom during the meal . i suspect he will keep offering to pay for crazy-expensive cold eggs as long as it gets him access to the facilities . 
came here thursday for dancing , it got a full dancefloor around N , the music was great and it was still really easy to get a beer at the bar . came back saturday morning for their brunch . if the attached diner fills up they open the bar section to patrons , don ' t worry , the bar cleans up nicely to accomodate for the brunchers . food was awesome and reasonably priced and the service was really good ( for a night out drinking or the morning after . 
really well cooked yakitori , but no smokiness from binchotan . this is probably as good as it gets for grilling over gas though . my only gripe with this place is that it ' s going for more of a stuffy ambiance . you can ' t really get loud drunk here . service is great for what they are going for , water constantly refilled , servers standing near our table at all times . but sometimes i just want to have fun . isn ' t that what izakaya yakitoris are all about ? 
this is actually a great place for very very small groups ( N people max ) . their burritos are decent ( though mostly overrated ) , their fried pickle chips are admittedly amazing , and their margarita pitchers are the real reason i ever used to go there . try to get there for happy hour or after Npm because the pitchers are half off . it ' s also very vegan vegetarian friendly . they ' re a lot more accommodating when they have their outdoor seating open , otherwise you could be stuck there for hours just waiting to be seated . i used to love this place . . . until this weekend , when some friends and i came here . there were N of us ( which is understandably a lot ) , and they looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for a table . it was a beautiful night , and all of their outdoor benches were lined up outside , but for whatever reason they refused to seat us . i get that it ' s popular and gets packed , but they could lose the attitude . we walked across the street to gunner ' s run , got seated immediately , had an amazing dinner , and dropped about N that el camino lost out on . i work at a cafe in old city , so i get that places have their ' off ' days , but places like el camino in the nolibs area . . . need to seriously calm down . 
all the good stuff with nice surprise twists . perfect menu for the neighborhood and they are so easygoing about it with their creative selves . much love to justyna mike . xoxo
frank pepe called his pizza the " poor man ' s answer to hunger " its so much more than that . i am thankful for pepe ' s pizza , it makes being from ct . something to brag about . lines out the door so be prepared . i like the plain cheese the best but the white clam is something serious ( and i dont even like clams ) . don ' t listen to people who like sally ' s better , they are crazy . i ' m all for women ' s rights but pepe ' s is the champion in this neighborhood battle . since N pepe ' s pizza rules . beers and soda and a real fun corner of new haven to hang around . 
N stars for locals . N for tourists . made the mistake of sending my out of town friend here . . . he didn ' t order " right " , people were pissed . . . it was a whole mess . at least half the people are first timer tourists so there ' s no excuse for this . 
love , love , love . service is great . menu is simple but fairly " artsy " in a good way . price point is - during night time . . . bottle of wine , N appetizer was N ( ? ) but that i guess depends on what is ordered . there aren ' t many places like this in the city . perhaps it was luck the few times i ' ve come to this place with the quiet , intimate ambience rather refreshingly peaceful unlike the cafe lalo or serendipity . ( although each has it ' s own positive uniqueness . ) if you want to hear yourself think and talk with your friend in low voice level , this would be the place . we once lucked out being able to listen to a mini solo piano concert by a super talented customer who had decided to jump on the piano . sitting is rather limited during winter season . i hope this place stays . . . unfound by masses . 
this has to be one of the best restaurants in newark--and i say that while ordering delivery . i sampled some of the chicken , ribs , and pork steak and was overall very pleased . the chicken was well-seasoned and juicy despite most of it coming from the breast , while the ribs could have used a little bit more salt but were tender and still delicious . the pork steak was cooked a little more than i would have liked , but the smokey grill flavor was there and it was still good . each half order comes with a huge portion of rice and fries , and i ' m glad we had half orders because the full order would have been disastrous--wayyy too much food . the fries didn ' t come out crispy , but this was to be expected with delivery take out--so no complaints here . furthermore , the rice was a bit much , so i didn ' t even eat all of it . a half order entree will set you back around N dollars , but picnic arguably gives you the best value for your money here in newark . great flavors and food at an even better price . next time , i ' ll dine in ! 
more classic than death co . , but not quite milk honey . i like their infusions , and the bartenders are knowledgable and willing to talk to you about why the drinks are made the way they are . i feel like if i ' d come here on a busier night , i wouldn ' t have liked it as much as i did . it ' s a cool place . i just can ' t see myself willing to brave the masses for it . 
N . N stars for the pork belly sandwich . N stars for others . just so one knows , it is about N and change for a sandwich , so over N incl tax . it is pricey but the quality of food and flavors is well worth it . the sandwich is bursting with flavors . for those that like banh mi , this is the next level . the sandwich has pickled vegetables , slices of asian pear and an extremely well flavored pork belly . they also add a chipotle-looking mayo sauce . this is probably the best sandwich i have had across any ethnic style in manhattan . however , for a better deal , the pork sandwich at vanessa ' s dumpling a few avenues east is a cheaper alternative . 
we liked the ambience , the server was friendly and knowledgeable , and the steak frites taste was good but the meat was pretty cold . . . . the biggest mistake was that a nice bottle of malbec came cold - really cold ! even a novice should know not to serve red wine cold . . . . . . we should have sent it back but she had already opened it . . . . . 
first off major props to these people for serving locally produced food . more of this needs to happen , and sweet afton serves a good product . nitty gritty i tried this place out after reading such rave reviews , but i ' m really not sold on sweet afton ' s portions , prices , service , or beer selection . the ambiance here is warm , but much too crowded and loud for a " romantic " scene that someone described below . they have eight to ten beers on tap , and they were serving two cask ales as well . a few points the ribs are delicious , nicely cooked , and not saucy . however , at N per plate , i ' d expect more than four ribs and a small bowl of cabbage . these guys are making a killing off this menu item alone . the burger cooked to perfection . no complaints about the meat , but the bun leaves me a little disappointed . at N for a cheeseburger without fries salad etc . , i also feel this is overpriced . the pickles interesting , but they ' re not worth another round . my relationship with deep fried pickles is colorful and full of life , but these ones left me a little confused . whats the point of putting a one-inch coating of soft batter on a pickle ? sa ' s pickles are all soft and bready , whereas my favorite tend to be crisp and light . sa ' s " spicy " aioli is also a little too watered down for my tastes . i like more of a zing . so , four beers , two entrees ( without sides ! ) , and one app later , our bill was over N before the tip . in my opinion , there are definitely other places worth searching out before camping at sweet afton ! 
desiring so badly a multi-ethnic gourmet experience , public with it ' s impressive menu seemed just ideal . after a very hi-tension friday at work the time had arrived . the best way do defuse tension from my head and my soul . villa maria " wairau reservre " sauvignon blanc god ' s nectar healing both of the above ! already my stomach has started to demonstrate commanding that tension be defused from it too , and be satisfied . pan seared foie gras on spiced french toast with mango chutney , maple glaze and crispy bacon glorius those butterflies had just started flying in my stomach and needed some more fuel to keep going . roasted duck breast with sesame soy dressing , cassava chips , wokked bok choy and picled chillies divine it ' s time for peace between brain , soul , stomach . chocolate espresso cake with butterscotch ice cream with whiskey sabayon mystical congratulations for the michelin star which is so well deserved ! public is by far the best fusion multi ethnic reastaurant in new york city ! well deserved ! 
food is horrible . ordered two cheeseburgers and worst i ' ve ever had . service isn ' t all that great either . 
arrive early ! i arrived before N pm in a saturday evening and we had to wait for about N min , but people who arrived about Npm couldn ' t get a table ! it was fully booked ! but it is worth it ! great meat for a fair price . get the tomato and burrata salad and the mashed potatoes with truffle oil ! 
i was looking for a cozy byob to take my sister for a birthday dinner when i came across la sirene . the food was amazing , the atmosphere was warm and inviting and the prices were very reasonable especially considering the fact that it ' s a byo ( oh yeah , and there ' s no corkage fee ) . probably not the best place to come with a large group , simply because there ' s just not enough room ( one of the things i loved ) . great little place would totally recommend to anyone and everyone . bring cash ! 
can i just say wow ? ! ! this place is delicious . not only is it delicious , the service here is impeccable ! the girls and i came here for dinner and hit a night that had a prix fix menu only for N . though to some it may seem pricey , we are definately not complaining ! there were so many scrumptious things to choose from the menu . in our party , we chose the poached lobster , foie gras and lamb ravioli for the first course and had the pork belly , ny steak , and sea bass for dinner . for dessert , we each had something dinner from the menu ranging from sorbets , cheeses , a pumpkin upside down cake , chocolate pecan tart to finally , a killer chocolate bread pudding that tasted like a souffle . to top it off , they gave us each a muffin to take home for breakfast . need i say more ? the food is great ! some may feel that N is a lot to pay for a meal , but the great thing also is that they aren ' t stingy with the portions at all , you will come out stuffed ! the service here is also on a whole other level . they server are so attentive to the point that some may feel to be overly so in that they fold your napkins , refill your drinks every N-N minutes , change silverwares and plates after each course , but i do enjoy being pampered and attended to at dinner so i was sitting happy . what i also loved about this restaurant is the synchronized serving of dishes that you don ' t see too often which adds an extra sense of personal attention to the table . i think that overall , gramercy tavern knows how to entertain , dine and make their guests feel special . they ' ve got the restaurant business down to a t ! 
wow absolutely outstanding ! ! ! not even done with half my sandwich and i feel compelled to write a review . the spicy salami with the tangy balsamic to the outstanding mozzarella , wow this place goes hard in the paint but in they in the kitchen instead and the bread . . . bomb thanx for the awesome sandwich and you will definitely be seeing me again . . . sorry lol
date evening . went with my husband for an early date evening away from the kids . our server lucy was excellent , pleasing personality and gracious enough to give recommendations from the menu . food was great , service was great and would highly recommend asking for lucy as your server ! ! ! ! 
this place is delicious . the juliano with peperoni and bacon added is pretty close to perfect . the customer service is awesome and the staff is very friendly . i wish they accepted credit card , but other than that this is definitely the best pizza place in the neighborhood . 
tasty seafood special on the caulk board and tried it out and wow was it delicious . the pad thai was also tasty . 
good spot for diner food in prospect heights . the sausage was superb . 
great all around food , everything is great besides the duck , i ' m a fan of duck , if the duck ' s not great at a thai food restaurant it ' s not an exemplorary thai food restaurant
my diet is very fortunate the line to heaven is sooooo long . 
came in for carry-out and the service was quick . i just got a spicy tuna roll and it was good ! ! ! i saw other things on the menu that i really want to try so i will be back . the decor was simple but nice . . . looks like a great place for a quite date ) 
not the best place in the world . the food is average at best . the price in the ads and online state the lunch buffet is N . N for adults and N . N N . N for kids . then when you pay they charge you the dinner price . they told me the lower prices are for holidays only . they then offered to take off N . i had to argue to get the correct price . this place is not worth the hassle . there are much better buffets in nj . 
love the pizza with tartufo my favorite , love the decor so welcoming , the owner sebastian is super sweet , the bartender is the nicest girl ever , some of the staff have attitude but other then that , its an amazing place to eat diner even if its a long wait at times . surely worth the wait ! ! ! 
this might be my favorite restaurant in new york . of course , i freaking love risotto , but if you don ' t like the pasta , there ' s pizza and other dishes too . it ' s all awesome and fairly inexpensive for huge portions of great ingredients ( try any of the selections that use truffle oil ) . the salads might be even better they use the greenest , springiest organic lettuces , fun ingredients like cranberries , and their dressings are flavorful and the perfect viscosity , made with the yummy goodness of quality olive oil . warm salty-seasoned breadsticks are great to wash down with their reasonably priced good wines . it ' s small , which makes the atmosphere sweet , but big groups might have to wait a bit for a table . they also offer tons of gluten-free dishes . i don ' t really know what that means , but it must be good for someone ! 
if you are looking for a restaurant that bends over backwards to please its customers , benito one is the place . we were just there last weekend for the very first time and plan to come back the next time we are in nyc . it was already packed when we got there and we were given a table that we were not satisfied with . the waiter was quick to accommodate , and while we waited outside to be re-seated , the owner came over to assure us that they would have another table for us . during the meal we sat and watched all the staff hustle from one table to the next . the owner was there making sure that everything was in order ( even helping to clean up a mess from a child at another table ) and that all customers were satisfied . i have never been to a place that treated its customers like they are important to them as this place . at the end of dinner , our waiter even did magic tricks for our table . the owner even came over and started talking and taking pictures with us . i give benito a N star based on the service alone , but the food was delicious and definitely worth returning for . the price was reasonable and the portions were generous . my husband , our two friends , and i were happy with all our meals . i highly recommend benito . 
been here three times in N years . the ambiance is very cool . bar is beautiful . service was great . server was very attentive . my lobster ( N dollars ) was rubbery like a dog chew toy . i sent it back but after waiting N mins , i was starving and ordered the chicken which was very dry . i filled up on creamed spinach and drinks . . . . . both very delicious . left a great tip , the server didn ' t cook the food . they should just serve the spinach . will not be returning unless they have a drive thru with the delicious spinach to go . 
i was in the area and wanted some pizza . i had the soho square and the margherita slice . the soho square is just an ordinary square , nothing special and definitely not worth N . N , tooo expensive the margherita slice was decent , it seems like they put the basil leaves in the oven also . the mozzarella was delicious and the crust was not too thick or thin and was crispy . it was quite pricey at N . N for a slice . if i was to have a full meal , that would cost me N , i can get a pie for that money . 
didn ' t enjoy the food that much . ordered vegetarian combo . only the lentils were ok but left the whole spinach and cabbage in the plate . they were just boiled vegetables with some basic spices . being an asian , the dish was a let down . eaten better things than this . 
this is one of new york city best kept hidden secrets . it is a hidden asset and once discovered you will want to come back for more . always a treat and never disappointing . can ' t wait to see what what new delicacies they will bake up for N ! 
great food , and atmosphere . with a very kind staff . their craft soda and brisket rule . 
i ' ve been to alta five times since they opened . every time , the food , the staff and the atmosphere have been fantastic . they know their wine . it ' s a place where you can safely order from the bottom end of the wine price list and know that you will get a great bottle . last time we went , we had the server pick our entire meal . glad we did , otherwise i wouldn ' t know that brussel sprouts can taste so delicious . the wooden architecture and wrap around upper level make for a truly romantic evening . 
warm , inviting interior ! great drink selection ! and awesome bar food ! carla and the a-team hooked us up tonight ! truffle fries , fried pickles , scotch eggs , and jerk chicken wings ! my personal favorite had to be the jerk chicken wings , just the right amount of heat and spice ! i ' m looking forward to trying the kobe beef sliders , and lamb nachos on my next visit ! 
amazing and cheap ! 
geronimo is my go to bar in new haven . the variety of mixed tequila drinks is great and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu . lauren always does a great job and is always fun to hangout with for a couple hours . service is always quick and the food is great . if people don ' t like this bar , its probably because they are used to going to crappy bars . 
chicken terrazza , shrimp dino , magliaro sandwich . . . . need i say more ? 
we ' ve been there a number of times . this review is not based on one visit . the food is only average . nothing to brag about . it is not authentic italian , but a contrived variation . no alcohol served . no liquor license . it is located on the first floor , and only the first floor , in a very tiny converted row home on a poorly lit , crime ridden corner in south philly . the tables are much too close which will cause you to feel as if you are in a sardine can . it is very claustrophopic . it gets hot and noisey . there is only one fire exit on the side street . the staff is nice , however they tend to rush you out so they can get the next customer seated since this place is so tiny . considering that you may leave after dinner and find an expensive parking ticket on your car , or some rude drivers double parked next to you ( an or in front of you , and or behind your vehicle ) while you are in l ' angolo , and as a result you can ' t leave south philly for hours because your vehicle is unable to exit the street parking until the person ( s ) who double-parked next to you may ( or may not ) come out and move their vehicle , it is just not worth it . it ' s disgusting when you come out of the restaurant and see roaches and rodents crawling around under your feet . overall - nightmarish . you have been advised . 
this is a place worth the wait for seating . there is a reason you have to wait . the place has great atmosphere , good food and very reasonable pricing . lines of people are to be expected . still , if i had company from out of town , i would not hesitate to bring them here . i found my server to be very friendly as was the owner , who came by the table to see that all was good . seating was comfortable . i really enjoyed my first time and will be back with friends very soon ! 
down the block from home . amazing pizza . . . it is awesome . minus one star for the rude waiter and the fact that it is cash only . . . 
i was lucky , only half an hour wait . got a seat at the bar , watching the chef making ramen noodle is the best part . not to mension the noodle is also awesome . i was happy to hear they open up new locations . 
i really wanted to love this place--the ambiance is funky and fun , a lot of the food is local , and i was perfectly open to trying clever variations on sushi . however , i found miya ' s selections more overpriced and average than unique and creative . we went there for a friend ' s birthday party , and had the opportunity to taste about half of the things on their menu , and all i can say is " meh . " don ' t get me wrong--some things were very tasty , but most ingredients were ill-paired , unfitting for sushi , and served in teensy portions with huge price tags . the rice--which is one of my favorite things about good sushi--was wretched ( overcooked , pressed flat , and unidentifiable ) , and a lot of the seaweed substitutes ( eggroll wraps , grape leaves , etc ) were just unpleasant . also , a final note the waiter did not hesitate to tell us that some of the rolls we had ordered " sucked " and that the chef was " jumping to pull them from the menu " because " no one likes them . " why are they serving things that no one likes , and that the boss wants to pull ? also , why did he not mention this before we ordered ? it was just a weird and unpleasant thing to mention . get some real sushi somewhere else , and save your poor wallet . trust me . 
i don ' t know where to begin . . . . sweet afton is my favorite spot in queens . i knew i would be a fan the first moment i stepped into this charming astoria bar restaurant . there is so much that i like about this place that i ' ll try to just make a list . the service is wonderful . all of the servers are attentive and always get your order right . the music is awesome , i ' m constantly finding new stuff to listen to just from whatever they ' re playing . the food , oh god the food . for dinner i usually get the sweet afton burger with gruyere cheese . i love their fried pickles , i thought that when i moved away from the south i ' d lose these forever , boy was i wrong . for brunch i always get their blueberry pancakes , they are my favs . the drink selection . best old fashioned in queens , hands down . on top of that they have a bunch of other fancy cocktails that are all delicious . along with that , they always have a wonderful selection of beers on tap and bottle . i often go out with intentions of trying a new spot to eat drink , but always end up at sweet afton instead . ) 
wow ! gorgeous place ! at first , i didn ' t know what to expect . i had been warned about the food . . . and it was everything it was cracked up to be . i was referred to this place by the staff at sheep station and they didn ' t lie . truly wonderful and such a great touch with the open kitchen , and general structure . presentation was a plus and the staff were friendly . 
food was ok , service was horrible . i would never go here again . not worth the hassle . not sure why you have a wait staff when the customer has to get up for everything . next time , just leave me a pitcher of water . ( in town for baseball game ) 
wow , the rating on yelp is right on everything was extremely good if you do not save room for the " tres leches con dulce de leche " cake you ' ll never know how great it is btw , our waiter ricardo was very pleasant to chat with . if anything goes wrong just threaten to excommunicate him to albuquerque nm lastly , just look for the address as you ' ll pass it up if walking too fast
i know dom is making a quite a lot of moola by charging so much for a pie . . . and i know that even in this economic climate people are still traveling from miles around just to have his famous pizzas . . . you don ' t come here for the decor , that ' s for sure . there are a lot of things storewise that could use a lot of improvement . yet , once again , you have to remind yourself that you ' re there for the pizza , not for the visual scenery of this run down pizza parlor . you wouldn ' t believe how much olive oil he uses when making his pizzas . the pie is literally swimming in it , and then when it ' s all cooked he adds more on top . there is so much grease and oil that you really do fear for a heart attack . however , despite all that , the girl and i ordered a whole pizza and we finished it . N slices for me and N for her . N for a pie with N toppings . well spent i ' d say . we waited N minutes . . . definitely worth the wait . everyone here can ' t be wrong , and i ' m not going to lie . . . the pizza here really is that good . 
it ' s basically the worst pizza ever made . but people seem to enjoy burnt cardboard crust , no cheese , and hair in their food . it ' s no wonder there is a long line of fat people who probably are so tired from standing for more than one minute that they rush their food down their throats without anytime to even taste the damn thing . if they had any taste buds , they ' d probably refuse to eat certain foods every once in a while , and maybe they wouldn ' t fall into the obese category of the bmi scale . chew your food , taste it ! this place is gross ! if you actually like the taste of food , j v on Nth ave is the place to go for pizza and any other dough , cheese and sauce related foods . 
it ' s not as though this place needs any more positive reviews , but i ' d love to just hop on the band-wagon and say this place is a must . definitely my favorite meal i have had in my four times visiting nyc . place has a great vibe , there will be a wait ( ours only took N minutes ) but the wait staff are friendly with great style and personalities , so you won ' t hate waiting . i know i should have gotten spicy pork , but my love for pesto is stronger than my love for meat , so i went with chicken . it was the effing best thing . i tried a bit of the spicy pork sando though , it was the business , too . 
ive been to spotted pig twice for brunch , the food is excellent . i didnt even realize there was an upstairs that opened up until the second time around . we got there at N , we were lucky that some friends managed to arrive earlier , put our names down , and so i barely grabbed a beer when our names were called . appetizers liver toast , you only need a taste , but its an amazing taste . my friends had faith in my taste buds otherwise they wouldnt try it . all agreed it was amazing . the deviled egg was good , but not memorable . entrees N people is alot of food . btw tahts the max they can accommodate for a group . N ) dutch baby with bacon-the perfect sweet and savory . a variation on a crepe with bacon that is thick and just so good N ) special - grilled cheese sandwich , good but not amazing N ) special - cuban sandwich with pulled pork , i didnt try it , no comment N ) frittata with kale and marjoram - interesting , and homey but not my favorite N ) onion tart with mixed greens- flaky , the right mix of oil and freshness N ) fried poached eggs with chorizo- wonderfully good , the flavors popped and the chorizo had the right amount of spice . the fried eggs are absolutely divine and everyone was pretty much envious of the choice . dessert was out of the question . our favorites by consensus the poached eggs and the dutch baby . 
i am not a huge fan of italian food , but this is now one of my favorite restaurants . they have a " N wine list " with about N different wines on it . they have a pasta special , which features an appetizer and unlimited portions of three ( rotating ) pastas . on top of the pasta they have many meat , vegetarian , and seafood items . my girlfriend especially enjoyed the branzino . 
just had the salmon sammy - great stuff ! 
the best pizza in brooklyn , bar none . this stuff kicks grimaldi ' s ass like a bad schoolgirl . drive over and pick up a tray , you ' ll need help getting it home . 
absolutely incredible every time . gnocchi are tasty bite sized pillows from heaven that melt in your mouth . the skate is equally divine . field squash appetizer is bursting with the flavor of autumn . the italian cooked cream panna cotta is light , refreshing and airy . the staff is knowledgeable about every detail in this culinary paradise . lupa serves food that dreams are made from . 
great tasting pizza pretty much a slice for everyone tastes buds . the tratt has affordable pricing and is in a great location . it is located near the middle school as well in the downtown area of the south orange town so it ' s a great place for an after school snack or just for people who want to catch up for a casual lunch or dinner date . the tratt has a variety of pizza toppings as well as a menu of other fine dinner choices such as their cheese fries ! this place is kid and family friendly . friendly staff and quick service ! 
review coming on my other account
i ' d give it a N . N . i really enjoyed the food . i can ' t remember what i ordered was actually called , but it was the rolled beef entree . this place was really what i wanted , not over the top , really good food . decent service . i wish i could find a place like this around home . . . i ' d go again . 
first , the food . the food was pretty good . the pan seared gnocchi were delicious and the cheese board was really good as well . everyone else in my party liked their dishes and it was presented very nicely . the portions were pretty small , however . i am usually for small portions , but the prices weren ' t small to go along with it . N for a main , something you ' d pay less than N for at a place like barbuzzo for something equal in size . second , the atmosphere . i came here for a special occasion dinner after making reservations two weeks in advance , requesting that we sit out in the garden . we arrived on time and were told that we ' d have to wait two hours if we wanted a garden seat and were placed by the bar inside instead . this was really disappointing as it was such a beautiful night . if i would have known i would have made reservations someplace else that would have been more accomodating . the inside was nice , but loud ( we had to shout across the table ) . i probably won ' t go back . 
southern comfort in the heart of brooklyn . great decor and service . i highly recommend the red velvet waffles and fried chicken , be warned serving size is huge . the dessert was a bit disappointing , not enough for my liking . the live band added a jazz edge that was very refreshing . 
my husband and i visited new york city this passed week for a few days . on friday night we stumbled upon district tap house for dinner in the garment district . it was a delightful experience . the food was great and so was the service . special thanks to christina , sophie , and shawn ! 
if you ' re hanging around south st . but need a minute to ditch the tourists , this is the joint . great stuff , great beer , cool crowd , ( but not too-cool-for-school ) . really nice . 
what a great experience . having lived over in europe for N years and know those folks don ' t rush through dinner there anytime i mention before we order that we are on european time the wait staff smile and understand not to rush us through our meal just to set new diners down . the food is excellent and with the exception of them being completely out of bread during our last visit i have never been disappointment in fact someone went across the street and brought bread to our table even though they were out . well done ! service lives . . . . . . . 
this is my favorite vetri experience to date . prices aren ' t bad , food tastes great , mostly smaller sized plates for sharing and trying multiple dishes . amis is on my list for a return trip . 
don ' t plan out getting a drink at the bar if u don ' t have a vagina or a plaid button down shirt . was blatantly ignored while asking a bar tender for a drink . should treat all customers respect not just the rich snobs . 
every day , i used to pass by this cute store front with huge jars of nutella along the front window and only recently did i actually stop in and see what all the fuss was about ! i pondered a little of what i should order - sweet or savory crepes ? i saw banana nutella crepes . i ' m there . the chef makes the crepe the traditional french way and right in front of you ! the chef also definitely does not skimp out on the nutella or bananas ! chocolate syrup is literally drenched all over this heavenly dessert and the side of vanilla bean ice cream is to die for ! the only thing that i do not like about crepes du nord is that it is only one block away from my job - too much of a temptation is my only complaint ! if you are ever are grabbing drinks on stone street , you must visit crepes du nord for their sweet or savory crepes ! visit jarofmocha . tumblr . com or follow us on twitter twitter . com jarofmocha for other food reviews in nyc ! 
how to get the most out of your dining experience N . follow suggestions on yelp about what to order N . ask your server , they probably know what ' s most popular , what ' s best N . order a sample platter if one is available this was how our dining experience at el vez was fantastic . coming here we knew to try out the guacamole . the waitress further suggested a particular guac that ' s always a crowd favorite . not being able to decide on what taco to order we taco tasting platter that came with sea bass , beef , chicken , pibil pork and mahi . the sea bass and the mahi stood out from the rest . tasty , mouth watering delicious . the beef , chicken and pork were good to but not as good as the sea bass and the mahi . service was okay . the waitress was nice and knowledgeable enough just not very attentive once our food was served . we didn ' t mind really as long as we still have our margaritas and the food . overall , i enjoyed my meal a lot and would not mind coming back for the fish tacos . 
prices are decent for what you are getting
super fresh super delicious and super pricey . but soooo worth it . . mmmm i create my own salad , and sandwich or reheat what is in the case . my favorite is the escarole and beans side dish . unfkingbeleiveable . 
excellent environment , great service
after having dinner at saxon parole , i was really surprised to read the poor reviews on here . not only was the food very good , the service was very attentive and friendly . dined with a good friend as a catch up dinner and it was the perfect spot . we weren ' t rushed , and we were able to fully leisurely enjoy the meal and wine at our own pace . i hate being rushed . we started with tuna tartare-- so good , i think it was infused with shizo leaf . delicate and perfect . i had the hanger steak and it was juicy and tender and delectable . she had the chicken . . . neither of us " order chicken " but damm this chicken was good . served with quinoa . tasty tasty . make sure your order the brussels side . i think they are broiled with siracha and chili oil . damm ! we were too full for dessert but the menu looked awesome . go to saxon parole and do it up . . . . it ' s a chill but upscale place that ' s ideal for dates , friends , family , you name it . 
lunchtime experience appetizers were just amazing ( N ) , and the atmosphere is really dope ( N ) . it is like an airy , sunlit bar during the day . its nose is right under the butt of brooklyn bridge , only a short walk from the southstreet seaport ( N , surprising convenience ) . the staff was courteous . ( N ) the winners were really those appetizers . mm ! food - chips and guacamole ( excellent guacamole ) came with an unexpected dipping plate of marinated beans , which tasted wonderful . - the fried oysters in cilantro butter and parmesian were , according to my lunch date , amazing . - the winner yo , those rattlesnakes ( first item on the menu ) blew my mind . i almost ordered them because , you know , bacon , but shied away . they ended up on my table anyway , and my god they were out of this world . ( see photo ) . roasted jalapenos stuffed with shrimp wrapped in bacon . yeah , it ' s an on-the-fence kind of combination until you put one in your mouth . blissful confusion . just keep chewing . - chicken-fried-chicken entree is a huge plate , we were too stuffed after the appetizer porn to appreciate . but it was simple , tasty , and extremely filling . from what i understand , lunch date came back literally the next day to eat the same thing . as for myself , i will certainly return if i wanted to treat my company to a savory " bar " cuisine experience . really , it was dope . i think the two beers , three appetizers , one N taco ( tuesdays ) , and a heaping chicken entree came out to N . 
if i had joined this site in N , i would have , without a doubt given this place N stars . since it is now N and scores of other gastropubs opened since then , i take it down a few notches . not that it is a bad place , i still love it . since N the portions have gotten a lot smaller on some plates ( esp calimari , if they still have it ) and the all tap all local beer scene leaves me with a lot to desire . however when they opened , a great friend of mine lived next door before rustica moved in , so it was absolutely perfect for a bar with good local beers and a burger , and fries , and calimari . i was N and it was my bar . exactly what i wanted , dark , loud , dart board , smelts . now that i ' m an old man and live in s . phila i don ' t get here very often , matter of fact , i still have great friends in the neighborhood , but more often than not we go to n . Nrd , maybe the time is right for a trip back to standard . on a side note , one chilly evening this fall i was waiting on a friend to get home and they were running late , so i popped in for a beer , and as it turns out , a burger . it was truly delicious , and at a place i don ' t feel like a creeper weirdo sitting in alone . 
if god was a slice of pizza , she would be a slice of artichoke pizza ! after finding that my favorite cafe had no sandwiches left , my best friend and i wandered over to artichoke ' s . it was my first time and i was initially won over by the gallon-sized beers before tasting the mecca of all pizzas . however the size of the beer has nothing on that slice of incredible-ness . the line is long but totally doable and an even twenty for two slices and two beers . after taking my first bite , i wasn ' t even sure how to place the taste because it ' s so unlike basic , traditional pizza . in short - totally amazing through and through ! 
wow , what a surprise . went here for brunch and shared the mediterranean sampler an order of the shashouska w meurguez . everything was tasty and fresh . the staff was super helpful with recommendations and have to say , i was happy with her decisions . would def recommend coming her with a friend or two who like sharing ! 
passed by this place so many times and it ' s always crowded so i finally decided to try it out . first of all , why are white people cooking my food ? ok , before you say i ' m racist , imagine going to a high-end italian restaurant and instead of chef goombah , you have chef wong cooking your pasta . or better yet , you make reservations for a N dollars dinner at masa and behind the sushi counter is chef enrique . ok , maybe last example is not a good one but food is very nasty . this is a case of hype from a popular chef who has neglect his goose and is only interested in collecting the golden eggs . it might have been great one time , but not anymore . 
not a sushi fan but this place was decent . the restaurant was brightly light and spacious . i enjoyed my meal and would probably bring a friend here if they loved sushi . 
momofuku , you just got kicked in the nuts ! your days are numbered ! finally a ramen place that has it all , looks , quality booze with great food ! i never thought i would describe a ramen bar as sexy but the restaurant is that . the lighting made everyone look attractive and sophisticated , the j-pop music is sultry yet poppy w o being obtrusive and the food . . mmmmm , i ' m smacking my lips just thinking about it . future date write this down . . . ippudo puts me in a mood , the hot and bothered kind of mood . on to the food yes , it ' s pricey for soup but hot damn ! the soup is awesome ! the pork is succulent , broth is amazing ( creamy , rich without being fatty ) and the noodles , while not as great as setagaya ' s , were still pretty damn good ! the rice cooker spoon they give you deserves some praise too ! it catches any accidental drops of noodle back into the bowl ( no splash ! ) and holds enough broth so you don ' t have to dip constantly . yum . i went during the soft-opening so there are a little kinks to work out took awhile to get water , the server left our menus on our table after we ordered and it took sometime to get the check but it wouldn ' t deter me from returning back . ippudo welcome to nyc . don ' t ever leave . 
excellent food , lamb bolgenese is amazing ! beat salad was also delectable . the apple cider was just perfect and delicious . will definitely be back . service was slow to seat , despite reservations and the kitchen took N mins to get our entrees out . that was annoying , but the food made up for it . 
excellent food , good service . my friends and i really had a good time . we had the best mojito ever . 
best cheesesteaks i ' ve had . i almost always get a chicken cheesesteak , whiz wit . the bread is always fresh and delicious , which really makes a sandwich for me . best for taking out as the seating is minimal . 
tried to go N days ago after reading some interesting reviews . . . but walked in and the place smelled very strongly like scented candles or incense . commented on that to the staff but they didn ' t seem to understand . surprising that the place would smell like this as the chef owner seems to be a pro ! 
if you like margaritas and good mexican food barrio chino is the best i ' ve tasted in the city , thus far . brunch is packed so if you don ' t want to wait come early . i had the veggie enchiladas . very tasty ! 
for N . N you just cant beat this bang for your buck . good falfal , and great hummus . watch the speed of the guy making your wich-he is done way before you finish even paying for your order . great ambiance . 
a home run every time . great service , fantastic food and great atmosphere . 
my boyfriend surprised me one time and took me here . we were both very excited and eager to come here . but a few minor complains and a few big ones kind of turned me off . lets start with the major ones . the food was pretty sub par . i realize there focus is on the cheesecake , but come on , you have to put some effort into the food ! the menu was like an encyclopedia ! it took forever to read through it . way too many things on the menu , and what we had wasn ' t very good . they should really try shrinking that monster of a menu and do their dishes right . the food was not very good . not bad , just not very good . they really have a little of everything , which i think its a problem . i know its a chain , but somebody up in hq should give the menu a theme , not just anything they can think of . more about the food , the prices were really overboard . the portions are big , but i could see them try to skimp . they only gave a few shrimps in my pasta . and for some reason , i can ' t help feeling they ' re trying to make the portions look bigger by putting them on bigger plates . for the terribly high prices , it is not worth it . minor complaints . it was very busy and our server didn ' t spend much time with us . when she came to our table it was to drop the food down and walk away . definitely make a reservation . our server sat us right next to another couple and our tables were really close . there was an empty table next to us that they could have sat us in . i know that sounds really minor , but i don ' t like the idea of being cluttered while i ' m dining out . i think they make the tables closer together to fit more people in at once and get more revenue . and last stupid complaint , their uniforms make them look snooty and stuck up . they are trying to pull off a high class first class feel , but that ' s not what this restaurant is . but now for the good . they ' re cheesecake does not disappoint ! i had the banana cream pie cheesecake and it was amazing ! i just want to try every cheesecake on their menu . i would come back here for a second try , but when its less busy . but if anything , i will always come for the dessert . 
one word . disappointing . . . well at least for brunch . seemed liked a forced breakfast menu taking their better liked dishes and adding eggs . staff was a little unfriendly and rushed despite a not too crowded day . the dining area is way too loud for normal conversation . bad acoustics . burgers were small . salads were not very unique . stick to mussels and fries and beer . 
wonderful farm to table restaurant with very creative and delicious dishes . charming atmosphere too ! 
i have been to caseus a few times , and i am definitely a fan . i love the atmosphere , and the cheese . the food has always been great and the staff is super friendly . i must admit , the service is inconsistent at times , but it doesn ' t really bother me all that much . i like the laid back atmosphere and really enjoy the food . . . they have an unbelievable fresh mozz salad ( i think it is only on wednesdays , though ) . . . i will be going back , probably this weekend . . . . 
best lobster rolls in the city . reasonable prices - N for a lobster roll and N for a pretty awesome shrimp roll ( if you think N is expensive for a lobster roll try spending N on the mayo-slathered monstrosities elsewhere ) both varieties are great- there ' s not too much mayo or butter and the seasoning accents but doesn ' t overwhelm everything . i love this place . 
smithfield made me happy . here ' s why -super sweet location in chelsea . -super duper selection of beers . it ' s not quantity , but rather quality ! hennepin , anyone ? ! -freakishly good music piping through their speakers . en vogue and whitney back-to-back ? i must be dreaming ! -the best light fixtures ever - they ' re from wbbm-chicago . who knows , maybe they were used in the nixon-kennedy presidential debate ? -their creepily awesome staff member who immediately re-tweeted my shout-out . i do not know who you are , but , that was fast . -foursquare check-in - free shot with a draft . what a great bar to stumble on into after a ' long ' flight from chicago ! 
love this place , love the coffee , all arround amazeing . 
one of the better burger bars ( along with five guys prime N ) that ' s popped up in the past couple years , serving all-around comfort food . i know why it ' s called plan b , you might need one if coming for dinner this place gets packed so be prepared to wait . minus a star for the inconsistent service ( rarely , the food ) which can be hit miss when busy , though their bold , rich menu often makes up for it . i love the fact they use verified humane meats and beef that ' s ground on-site daily you can really taste the difference . there are also seafood and chicken options aside from the many original burger choices . and vegetarians and gluten-intolerant diners fret not , they have amazing salads and a full gluten-free menu ( including dessert beer ! ) their beer selection is the best around for all the hop-heads out there about equal to prime N down the road , with a ton of options . speedy and knowledgeable bartenders are more than willing to give samples recommendations . lots of bourbons , as well . a must-try for all . there ' s something on the menu for everyone . enjoy ! 
i loved the black label burger . the bone marrow , not so much . 
this place has got a great feel ! the polished wood tables and the amazing photos on the wall are so great for the mood . the sunny chicken-lemongrass soup is delish ! awesome all around food , service , atmosphere experience . highly recommend ! 
had a nice dinner planned with family on friday night - heard so much about the jazz night . went and was completely disappointed in the food and the service . the jazz was great but it stopped really early - it appeared as if management cut it short for some reason - needless to say we were extremely unhappy - if you ' re going to advertise live music , make sure you provide it ! 
always solid here , although there can be a long wait for dinner . late brunch is my favorite time ! 
let ' s get vietnamese sandwiches ! that ' s what my friend said after a N . N hour class and we were all starving . when i think of vietnamese sandwiches i think of a N . N sandwich that reminds me of home . oh how i miss them . only chinatown has them for that cheap . so i was brought here by my friend and was told that the pork was the best you could get . me , not a huge fan of pork was hesitant . but decided to give it a try . so it turns out , the sandwich is not a vietnamese sandwich at all . it kind of looks like one , but it ' s not . same condiments , but different taste and meats . it was a cambodian sandwich shop . who would have guessed ? well anyways , i got the pulled pork which was N . N , well over the price of a vietnamese sandwich . my other two friends got the pork belly sandwich which i ' m guessing was the most popular one . one of my friends didn ' t want cilantro , and the guy was very rude about no substitutions . in fact he was a jerk . besides that , the sandwiches were really really good . they look small , but very filling . very messy to eat . there is seating up stairs . they also have hand wipes too . so much tasty sauce , but very good . you feel very heavy after eating the sandwich , but it ' s worth every bite . i could barely finish mines . anyways , this place is highly recommended if you re looking for a sloppy delicious sandwich . don ' t mind the jerk taking your order though . it ' s worth the price . cash only . enjoy ! 
nice . i would give it N and a half stars . the food was delicious . i might go back for breakfast . 
went to ze brauhaus with a few friends for some food and drinks , and we were not disappointed . situated on south street , this restaurant stands out with the beautiful wood facade , which is very welcoming and not what one would expect on south . the food was delicious . we had the pretzels and the fish appetizer plate to start . the mustards they give you on the table are great , it wont disappoint if you have been to places like hofbrauhaus in munich or other similar german beerhalls . tip ask for the house parsley butter or whatever it is called your waitress will know what you are talking about . dip the pretzels in that it is . . . buttery . the selection of beer is great , and a good value ( around N . N for a half litre ) . for dinner , i had the schnitzle , which was delicious . my friends all had various sausages which were all very good . overall i would reccommend this place to anyone except a vegetarian , because pretzels , beers , and sausage is a pretty good equation for a good time . 
this review is more of a three . three seven five review . i ' ve been hearing a lot about this particular spot from friends in astoria and finally had a chance to eat there on a friday night . we arrived there around N Npm or so and were greeted quickly , and then seated quickly . and it was pretty full . at first we were given a seat at the bar but eventually were able to get some seats by the longer share tables . the decor was pretty cool and did have potential to be a spot where two can go on a romantic date - the lights were dim , there were candles , and the overall vibe and feel was warm . but there were two problems . one is beyond excessively loud with the live band playing . it was so loud i literally had to say " what ? " to my girlfriend numerous times and also lean over across the table to tell her what i was saying . and second , there just weren ' t enough seats for two . so , it could work as a date spot . but if it ' s your first time with the other then i wouldn ' t go here . now on to the food . so it seems this " artisan " spot has caught onto some korean " foodie " craze that everyone else is on . they kind of had a kimchi everything . and that ' s almost exactly what we tried . we started with their kimchi appetizers . to be honest , they tasted like regular dumplings with some kimchi . although they tasted fine the dumplings were too doughy . the first main dish we tried was their " kickshaw bibimpap . " just like actual korean bibimpa , it had the rice , the egg ( substituted with quail egg ) , and a additional ingredients ( they had shiitake mushrooms , vermicelli , and kimchi consomme ) . it tasted fine all together , but unfortunately the sauce ( and yes , this is supposed to be different and " artisan " ) made the dish taste a little bit weird . it was savory and sweet and i guess i ' m just used to actual korean bibimbap . i guess it would ' ve been much better if they had called it something else . next we had the " mac n ' cheese " and that was fine . it was a little burnt , but french beans and roasted vegetables tasted pretty good . nothing out of the ordinary . oh yes , the sour cherry soda was flavorful but just a little too pricey imo . so in the end i wouldn ' t mind coming back to try other items on the menu but it won ' t be a rush . 
stumbled upon this neighborhood gem while in the area visitng clients for my job . did a quick yelp search for lunch in the area , and sure glad i stopped here . truly is the standard for a local spot . located straight in the middle of the neighborhood , with parking to the side of the restaurant , i felt welcomed as an out of towner amongst the regulars . i stopped in on a tuesday afternoon , and lucky for me it was i was a regular from the neighborhood . highly recommend the turf burger and fries ( with the chipotle aoli that comes with it ) . 
dinic ' s italian style pork sandwich with sharp provolone is the only pork sandwich i really enjoy , it ' s head and shoulders above any other pork sandwich i ' ve had in my life . if you want the absolute best , go to dinic ' s . 
love this little place ! steak salad with avocado is awesome and so is the polenta dish . it ' s very small though so if you come on a weekend night be prepared for a wait . the wine selection could also use some improvements but the mojitos and caipirinhas are solid . way to go ! 
amazing pasta . confused , disoriented service especially for a high class place . 
great little place . good atmosphere but it is definitely a tight fit on a weekend night so reservations are best . good authentic dishes with a mix of their own stuff . great mojitos and margarhitas too . 
love the food here ! almost all the tapas are delicous ! the atmosphere is really nice here too . it gets really loud at night , but it ' s fun . the food is well priced too . breakfast is delicious too ! 
came with my roommate for brunch to celebrate my birthday . she ' d been a million times , but it was my first time . she knew ahead of time that she was going to order the kale salad with baked eggs . i was going to get the waffles--- or was it pancakes ? lol--- well , either way they were out of them already ( at Nam on sunday ) ! and it was probably for the best because i ended up following my roommate ' s lead and going with the kale salad topped with eggs also . it was delicious ! but i cant comment on any other dishes yet . 
first , be prepared for a little attitude . we had no dinner reservations and we asked to be seated in the outdoor area which was virtually empty . the young hostess , who looked like she was in high school asked " did we make a reservation ? " i should have responded , " we didn ' t , did you ? " she then proceeded to type something into the computer for the next few minutes . growing impatient , we asked whether there was a problem , she responded , " i ' m working on it " . we were eventually seated and had a nice meal . i won ' t bother describing what we had because this attitude thing just turned me off to the place . 
went last night with a friend . i went a few years ago , but loved it much more the second time around . what a cozy place we split pumpkin ghnocci-so amazing ! both got the hanger steak-amazing as well me pumpkin poundcake over carmel sauce-ok friend-flourless cake-good both got coffee meal was N for everything , not too bad ! service was great ! and was pretty crowded for a thursday night in todays economy ! only one table was empty ( i am sure reservations were for later ) 
this could not be a cuter spot . the service is excellent , the setting is adorable , and the food is fantastic . it ' s the perfect spot for a quiet solo lunch or a nice morning coffee with friends . 
i came here for the first time today with a co-worker . she lives nearby and said the food is good- so we came for lunch . i am a vegetarian- meat makes me sick . so i was super glad to find a place that serves delicious indian food and is pure vegetarian ( no beef broth , etc . ) . i had the spinach dosa , and my co-worker had the masala dosa . both were delicious ( i tried a bit of her ' s ) . we also finished off the meal with masala chai . so nice ! i hope to come back very soon ! 
i love the food here , plus it has a great atmosphere . the food is always up to the standards of my picky taste buds . ( especially their chicken gyro ) my only complaint is that sometimes the staff aren ' t the friendliest , but other than that i would definitely recommend it . 
great for brunch . so far one of the best bloody mary ' s around . food so far has been awesome and the menu has something for everyone ( i ' ve had potato waffle benedict , asian peanut chicken salad , prime rib benedict , croaker , and brooklyn-style calamari . big fan of the decor ( tile , black weathered wood , beachwood ceiling , rustic modern amenities ) . tile makes it a bit noisy , but doesn ' t affect the experience . optional seats right along the sidewalk . def . recommended . 
to make a long story short . the place is gaudy ( neon sign ) and bigots . the sandwich is only famous because of celebs . there is no flavor or taste outside of the cheese whatsoever ! i asked for the works and they put some barely fried onions on it ! what a joke ! garbage totally . i ' ll try pat ' s next time but i can get a better cheese steak from my local italian pizza joint . i ' m glad i finally went because i wanted to know what the hype was about but there really is none . do not waste your money or time ! 
minus N for the service , minus N for the food . came here with a party of N and the hostess refused to seat us because the Nth person was going to be joining us later for dinner . she insisted that our full party needs to have arrived , which is understandable , but our Nth was simply " dropping in " later in the night to say hello and grab a quick drink with us at the table . after much negotiating , she finally agreed to seat us , but gave us a time window of an N . N hours to eat and leave because she had a different reservation later that evening ( which doesn ' t make much sense because that would ' ve been the case regardless of when that other person in our party were to arrive ) . it was also pouring outside and the other party never showed up . food was average . this artichoke dip thing that everyone has hyped up was unremarkable . we also got this weird buffalo flavored ribs appetizer thing which is a really odd combination , plus the ribs were not tender at all . 
good food and good service , but overpriced . i ' m a big fan of the mediterranean steak salad , the gyro platter , the grape leaves , and their desserts . 
this is the best hot pastrami sandwich ever . i went to one of those places on foodtv in north jersey and all i kept thinking was i should of rushed home to get to k a before they closed . i live in nj about N minutes from ben or walt and it takes me bout N minutes to get here with no traffic from home and well worth the drive . i love this place . potato salad is good to . have old school hood drinks aka franks black cherry soda . did i say i love this place ? the sandwiches are huge . its enough to share with someone else . pastrami sliced thin , warm on nice fresh bread . line is always long but they move fast so N-Nminutes during busy times . 
i ' ve come here about N or N times have had all of the tacos except the rare fish taco . i can ' t wait to try it . this little stand is absolutely amazing . the people who work there are super nice and they know what good food is . the chilorio brisket taco is the best taco i ' ve had in nyc . no other tacos come close to their tacos . 
best tapas place i can think of in new york . everything sounded so good on the menu , we had a rather difficult time to pick . and we definitely went overboard with the sampling . we did ask our waiter for recommendations and he was most helpful . i forget all the tapas we ordered , but there was brussels , goad cheese with honey , bacon wrapped dates , meatballs , among other goodness ' . . . the setup is also well done . let ' s start with how unpretentious is it from the street , almost missed it . walk down a couple of steps and be greeted by friendly bartenders waiting on quite the number of people at the long bar . it ' s either a wait for a table or just happy hour crowd but busy nevertheless . then inside the restaurant area i couldn ' t pin-point where it reminded me of but somewhere abroad with much history . liked the opening where the tables upstairs felt like part of everyone on the main floor . can ' t wait to go back ! 
hope garage is a little gem in brooklyn ! outside of it being located in a cool revamped garage ( hence the name ) the food and drinks are spectacular ! ! the staff is so sweet and recommended some really delicious items for us to try . the hand crafted cocktails and beers were my absolute favorite ! ! if you ever find your self walking around willliamsburg , this is definitely a place to pop in and check out . 
my boyfriend took me there for dinner . it was amazing ! it was like being on the titanic . food was great and so was ambiance . 
great place ! 
the sangria bar is great as is the food . i love it . especially for brunch . 
the chickens here are absolutely fantastic ( crispy skin , tender , moist , flavorful meat ) , but what ' s particularly worth noting is that i think these folks are doing some of the best sandwiches in the city right now . between their great bread , incredibly fresh ingredients and great construction , you just can ' t go wrong , but the bbq chicken sandwich is masterpiece of tender chicken , tangy spicy sauce and cool veggies to add some crunch . collard greens , mac and cheese , and beet feta salad are all fantastic sides . don ' t know where they get their ingredients from but they ' re always very very fresh . 
absolutely love momo sushi shack ! it ' s a little bit of a hike from the upper east side , but it ' s totally worth it for the omakase style tasting menu ( min N a head ) . seriously the best value for the amount of food and quality that you receive . my favorite dish is the chicken karaage and the pork betty . i also love the fact that momo uses shiso leaf instead of wasabi to add some kick to their dishes . the servers are all very well informed and have no trouble going through the menu or suggesting combinations as it is a tapas style menu . the decor is warm , earthy and minimalistic while the dinner atmosphere is lively and communal due to the long wooden tables ( think cafeteria style ) . i haven ' t been for lunch , but i hear that it ' s a little lazier . definitely recommend this place to friends and anyone near brooklyn looking for great sushi ( spicy mcbomb ! ) or a good , easy going place to hang out for some sake and small plates to share . 
the grinders here are amazing ! i have always gotten a lot of meat on them and the ingredients always taste great . the grinders are huge . i usually order the smaller of the two and still have enough to last me for two meals . i ' ve tried the pizza and wasn ' t overly thrilled with it , but it wasn ' t bad . my only complaint is service if you stop by the shop . i ' ve ordered a grinder and a calzone on two separate occasions for pick up . both times , i waited the amount of time they told me before even leaving home . i still had to wait for them to make my food once i arrived . if it ' s going to take longer , that ' s fine , but i ' d rather know when i ordered . 
always loved this place . with such a great ambiance , a sexy scene and great music . the food here is absolutely amazing , they just reinvented the menu and i didn ' t think it was possible to be better but its the best food i ' ve had ever ! ! ! the people are all so nice and treat you like family , the owner is so hospitable and his infectious laughter makes everyone in your party have a great night every time . i ' ve been there Nx this week and will continue to bring all my friends here for any occasion . . even just going there for the amazing margaritas is always fun . super satisfied ) 
sometimes bad service ruins the whole dinner . if it is just bad service , i will give it three-star for its food . but , but a waiter in this restaurant is really rude . speak loudly to us in a bad mood never come to refill our hot tea one of our food is simply forgot to put in urge us to pay tips . it ' s the worst experience for us to be in new york last time . i will never come to this restaurant ! ! ! ! ! ! 
delicious food ! if they were only more conveniently located , i would go there more often . 
i , like the young lady who got sick because of lack of willingness to accommodate modificartions , experienced underrcooked chicken , overcooked pasta , and not such a friendly bartender . . had asked for some simple modifications to my order and was flat out told no , the chef does not modify that is the way he serves it ( quote unquote ) they just opened . . may give it another try down the road . . lonnnng after they have time to get the kinks out . but with all the fabulous restaurants on the upper eastside , ristorante morini , vico , sette mezzo , campangola , cafe bolud , daniel and so forth . . it may be some time . 
all my girlfriends and i love this place ! we come here for happy hour frequently and the crispy chickpeas are out . of . this . world . also , all of the staff are charming and incredible . we especially love elana very personable but never intrusive , and always willing to accommodate our needs . oh yeah , the mojitos are super fresh and super amazing ! 
the pittance of mexican options in center city truly frustrated me until i discovered jose pistola ' s . i had unknowingly walked by its low-key storefront numerous times without realizing it was a mexican spot , and indeed nothing about the interior of the space screams " mexican eats " either . rather , you ' ll find a somewhat narrow space that leans a bit divey and gets rather raucous on the weekends . but don ' t let that dissuade you , pistola ' s food ranks among the better ( and more reasonably priced ) mexican i ' ve tasted outside of the south philly taquerias . to boot , it boasts an impressive craft beer program and tasty , economically priced margaritas . our party began with pistola ' s riff on queso , and it greeted us with a large , hot crock of bubbling cheese that had a good amount of seasoning and didn ' t congeal as our meal progressed . the thick , fresh tortilla chips served with it carried a particularly enjoyable crunch and didn ' t balk under the heavy cheese dip . the mains at pistola ' s similarly satisfy flavorwise , though run scant we would ' ve remained hungry had we not opted for an appetizer . though i received only two tuna tacos , they still had a lot of texturally interesting components and brought a lot of flavor with ostensibly sushi-grade , rare tuna , radish , sweet pepper sauce , and very fresh , smooth guacamole . my companions enjoyed their sopes , noting the appealingly crispy outsides and tender interiors while cursing the awkwardly small plates that made eating difficult . few mexican joints offer a beer selection this good and a menu so broad i ' m sure not everything is a winner but we enjoyed all the food we tried . i ' ll be back soon enough when the mexican craving strikes . 
incredible genuine italian food in a beautiful atmosphere with exceptional service ! tis has become my favorite italian restaurant in all of nyc ! 
wow , this place is good ! the service is good , the people are nice , the food is amazing . i ordered pad thai and my girl friend ordered mussels and both was delicious . the service was great , our server was super friendly and best of all the price for what you get is unbeatable . the only downside from this experience was the wait for a table was a little too long and the waiting area crowded . 
this was my second effort at liking the blue elephant trail and , unfortunately , i have to say the place is , in my opinion , just " ok . " . my girlfriend and i started with two appetizers , the spring rolls and the chicken satay . both of these were quite good the spring rolls were large , flavorful and served with an excellent plum sauce , while the chicken was flavorful and very tender . i wish ee had stopped there . we next moved on to the shrimp loves scallops . unfortunately , just like the pad thai and phuket seafood that i had on my prior visit , this dish was bland and lifeless . additionally , at N i would have expected more than N shrimp and two scallops ( cut into quarters ) . service was also ok , not bad , not good , just ok . to me , if you want appetizers and a couple of drinks , this place might do the trick . their main courses , however , leave much to be desired . 
the food was very good . prices were little high but i would definitely go back . 
love this place ! ! ! ! fast and fresh , food is great and very affordable ! ! 
food poisoning x ' s N people saturday , march Nth , N . out of a group of N of us , N ate the fish tacos and all N became violently ill vomiting , diarrhea , cramps , sweats , chills . one person became sick after dinner that evening , the other N within N hours . all had to miss work at the beginning of the week . when i called the restaurant to report our illnesses ( partly for the restaurant ' s own sake thinking they would be grateful ) they claimed we probably just caught a stomach bug and couldn ' t provide us with an apology or even a partial refund . keep in mind it was a group of N people whose only interaction all month was at this restaurant . they stated they needed our doctors ' names , symptoms , and timelines of sickness . after informing them that requesting my doctor ' s name and medical records was inappropriate and or illegal they said they " were just playing devil ' s advocate with us " -family friendly environment ! ! the managers of this restaurant stated that it couldn ' t be food poisoning because no one else had called ( besides the other N sick people from my group who did call ) . so , if you ' re reading this and you ate at the restaurant on or around march Nth ( or ever ) and became violently ill , you might want to know it was probably food poisoning from this restaurant . i explained to the manager the reason we were probably the first to call is due to our large sample size a group of N patrons in which N get sick after eating the same dish is a much easier tell for food poisoning than a group of N patrons eating separate dishes in which only N gets sick and may chalk it up to a stomach bug . after being belittled on the telephone by multiple managers ( via the owner who was too sheepish to speak himself ) i was ensured i ' d have the fish tacos ( N ) refunded onto my credit card . well , multiple days have passed and they haven ' t been refunded and so here i am telling our story which i promised i wouldn ' t if we were given a refund . i gave them a chance to make things right and they didn ' t take it . they argued on the phone for N hours over a N refund on a bill that was close to N ! as i explained to the managers , i approached them first to make this right and if they didn ' t make an attempt i would open it up to the reviews as is fair practice for any restaurant . my recommendation is don ' t eat here and if you did eat here and became ill at any point , consider food poisoning to be the culprit . update xochitl credited us for the fish tacos . 
the food tastes great . i worked around the area so i go there several times with a co worker especially when they just opened . the only thing is that its really very small place . stting is a bit uncomfortable because there is not enough space-too close from the other person siting beside you , but you may just want to order by phone for delivery . you have to ask for utensils and napkin when you order coz sometimes its not there . but food wise a . 
quick delivery ! dinner arrived hot and yummy . 
the curry is flavorful , and the katsu was nice and tender crispy . the serving size is pretty big , and it wasn ' t even the grand slam . definitely would come back to try out all the different curry and toppings
went here twice and haven ' t been let down yet . their roti is magnificent , the service is fast and the spicy fried squid tentacles leave me smiling for hours . in all seriousness , the seafood rice noodles is a simple yet infinitely flavorful dish that is enough to fill one but serve two or three . the salted fish and broccoli ? fantastic . i ' ve yet to try even a quarter of the menu , but i plan on going back to remedy that . 
excellent food . large portions , they included paper plates without being asked . decent price for the quality and quantity
best greek restaurant by a mile in the entire city . the only drawback , huge lines all the time . if you are patient enough , food is amazing . they always give you a complimentary desert at the end . this place rocks . 
haven ' t been back in a while so we were pleasantly surprised at how great , quick and deliciously authentic food was . what we really like about this place is that it ' s open at all hours and one can get as little or lot of food as one wants- and beer too if you are so inclined . this worked out well for us since we arrived at an odd meal hour and one person was hungry an another not so . so many choices too ! ! always reasonably priced , tasty and quick ! can ' t be beat . 
they still serve great food and good amounts of it . the new place is trendy and luxurious , but i missed the cozy feel of the old place . you get your worth with overall quality of food , service , ambiance here . 
the beer here was incredibly good . i came away with a new appreciation of imperial porters . i ' m not sure that i would make it my regular place due to the space being too small . everyone bumped into everyone on the way out ( including the over-indulged guided out by their surprisingly patient friends ) . but i had a good time and it fit my mood ! also , the doorman ( at least last night ) was awesome ! 
ok , so this place had me at biscuits and gravy . let me add that the smothered eggs biscuits and gravy is very good . the cajun bloody mary is a nice spicy twist on this classic brunch cocktail . we will be back for brunch again . 
it kicked bobby flays ass and its atop of premier asian food a must go
the best mexican food i have had in ages . . . the quesadilla was awesome . . the meal portions are huge . . . the only drawback is the wait time , but you get some yummy chips to give you company in that time . . 
i stayed in ny for a week and i could have eaten there every single day . . and i almost did ! from the hearty breakfast to the macaroni and cheese to the steak burgers and the best cheesecake ever . . . it was fantastic ! 
ive always been a fan of going out on the weekday to find something well worth my night . yakitori boy is open N N so i know i can always stop by if i want to do something . theres karaoke , food and a bar . what more can you ask for , right ? wrong . dont get me wrong . the place is cool if its not packed . once it gets jammed up , you have to wait downstairs for a while . ive waited for a good hour once . i havent really eaten there so i cant rate the food but alcohol is alcohol haha . when it gets packed upstairs , i feel like theres no room to breathe especially since the fog machine thingy would get turned on . then theres the " lets find parking in chinatown " routine . thats a hassle for me . like i said before , good when its not packed . when its packed , you will be standing there either at the bar or just against the wall like a wallflower . there will never be any seats . tuesday nights usually gets packed up so i avoid that day . havent been there any other days like that so i cant tell you . . . 
we used zinna ' s bistro for our rehearsal dinner and we could not be happier with our choice ! dawn and her staff were so accommodating and wonderful each step of the way . the food was really amazing . i was wishing i didn ' t have a wedding dress to fit into the next day so i could ' ve had more to eat ! the place is very beautifully decorated . we loved the byob aspect because it allowed us to hand pick a few favorites for our guests . we dropped off the boxes in the afternoon and when we showed up it was all beautifully arranged on its own table with all the wine glasses set out . dawn even saved a copy of the menu for me to keep in my scrapbook . we really loved everything about the dinner , service and planning . thank you ! ! 
best tacos in nyc ! hands down ! 
i really enjoyed my dinner at north end grill with one of my best girl friends . the service is top-notch , the servers delivered plates in perfect unison throughout of the meal . the dining room is elegant and tastefully done . every part of my meal was very good . my friend and i shared the trumpet royal mushroom pizza with ricotta , which we found flavorful and have a lovely creamy texture from the ricotta . for our entrees , i had the scallops ( perfectly cooked ) with grilled cauliflower and cider jus and my friend had the braised beef short ribs with kale risoato that my friend absolutely loved . all the dishes were ones that we expected from a restaurant of this quality . i have to say , even though the food was delicious , the true stars of the meal were the desserts ! the butterscotch pot de creme is with chocolate crumble and maltmellows were to die for ! it was a small bowl of absolute heaven , it was just the right amount of sweet and the chocolate crumble provided great texture ! hands down , the pot de creme was the highlight of my meal - and my new favorite dessert of all time . we also had the cinnamon toast ice cream ( delicious and unique flavor ) , chocolate and brown butter cake ( divine with the pear ice cream ) and one more dessert that i forget the name of but it was a an apple tart with ice cream . all of the desserts were phenomenal -- kudos to the pastry chef and team on them . i ' ll be coming back for more ! 
i ' ve been going to fu hing for takeout since i moved to bayonne in N . i ' ve watched their kids grow up behind the counter . i like that their son is now contributing to the social media aspect , it ' s nice . but , this review is of the food . fu hing is the best take-out in bayonne . they don ' t have any seating ( except for one table where you can wait for things ) but it ' s worth getting and taking home . they overpack the containers , the prices are great , and the service is always very good . i get a lot of the staples here - the ribs , the dumplings , wonton soup , etc . it ' s half the price of when i order from places up near work , and the food is much better . it ' s not gourmet , it ' s not sit-down , but when you want chinese take-out it ' s fresh , it ' s good and i can definitely recommend it . if i ask for something special ( like please don ' t brush the ribs with extra sauce because i don ' t need the sugar or make something extra spicy ) they always comply . if i have a last-minute , very large order due to a horde of descending relatives , it ' s never a problem . recommended spare ribs , beef broccoli , hot sour soup , wonton soup , moo shoo pork ( my husband ' s favorite ) , chicken with garlic sauce . my son likes their shrimp with lobster sauce . they throw in extras - you get a freebie when you order over N . N ( an eggroll , or fried wontons or soup or soda ) and you get a pt of general tso ' s if you order over N . not bad , haha . cash only ! someone listed that they accept card but they never have . 
this is by far my favorite restaurant . yes its very small , very crowded and waiting time during peak hours . however , the food is absolutely amazing . the sangria is fantastic , i can drink a pitcher of it by myself . the servings are very small but unforgettable . every time i eat there , i order the different ways they make paella . i loves croquettes de hamon . my boyfriend loves their emapanadas . its a different atmosphere compared to other restaurants . its overall one of the best places to eat in nyc . 
the best part about this place is that . . . they deliver ! what an absolutely fabulous idea . the delivery was fast , the food was hot , the delivery guy was pleasant , the ribs were wonderful ! i was anxious to try the hushpuppies since i have heard good things about them . they were tasty , but a little greasy and not what i had in mind . they were more like a fritter than a hushpuppy . i am still on a quest to find a replica of the type of hushpuppy you get in the south . these were far from what i was looking for , but don ' t get me wrong - there were very good . i liked the corn in them . it was a great , convenient and reasonably priced meal and i will definitely be ordering ( or visiting ) here again ! 
i was totally disappointed in this place , i so wanted to like it and make it a regular place , but the food is awful ! the fried calamari was terrible , and looked like it had come out of a freezer bag and then been fried a couple of hours ago . we complained but our waitress told us they made it fresh every day . . . my fiance ordered a filet mignon steak with port wine gravy , although the steak was perfectly cooked it was so over salted neither of us could eat it , the gravy on the plate had a skin on it when it got to the table , it must have been sitting under a hot lamp for so long . i had chicken over pasta with possibly the worst marsala sauce i ' ve ever tasted , i eat most food even if it ' s bad and i couldn ' t eat it . in fact neither of us could eat barely any of the meals and when we complained the owner told us he was sorry their best was not good enough for us - as if we were some kind of connoisseurs , which we are in no means , but apparently gravy with skin is the best they can do . never again ! 
the food is wonderful and is a must eat if your looking for good italian food . this is not a place to miss if you live in philly . the dishes are large and very filling ! 
went here with a friend . this is definitely a hot spot really crowded . it ' s a place that you can go with your friends for a decent meal that ' s not too pricey . the service here is decent . nothing i can really complain about . it ' s not exactly top notch , but if you are expecting N-star service from a place like this , than you are definitely mistaken . the food here was average . the avocado summer roll was a little bland and the noodles i ordered was nothing to write home about . was it bad ? no . but it ' s not a place where i would feel that i would have to come back just for the food . the restaurant itself looks nice . very well decorated - screams of hip and trendy . but the tables are too damn close together . it makes for a very loud environment that you have to talk loudly just to be heard . people squeezing past you to get to your tables put their ass right in your food - how is that appealing ? it ' s a shame that restaurant owners are trying to overcrowd tables in order to maximize profits . a little bit of extra space would have earned another star from me . 
ants pants now has dinner , but brunch is still their strong suit . like breakfast all our food came out at once instead of our salad coming out first and then our entree . our table was a two top , and here we were with a three large plates and two small plates and two glasses ! not to mention my friend and i are both klutzes this was a recipe for a disaster waiting to happen . our beetroot salad was great and i am going to start frying capers and putting them on everything . the eggplant fries were greasy and not my idea , but my friend really wanted to try them . they were worth trying so we know not to get them again . we shared the fish tacos and they were incredible . perfect fish , homemade corn tortillas that kinda fall apart , but in a good way and amazing fresh pineapple jalape o salsa . i will definitely be back for the fish tacos , but can skip the eggplant fries ! 
i always get hummus and baba ganoush to go and i love them both . it ' s been more than three times that i ' ve ordered . next time i will definitely eat there and try more options from their menu . the pita is very tasty too , reminds me of home . . . 
bistango is every bit as good as any restaurant you ' ll find in rome or the rest of italy . i had to spend a few hours nearby at an nyu medical facility waiting for tests to be done , and they sent me out to get some lunch . i wandered into bistango . it ' s lovely and rustic and small on a corner . the waiter asked me if i had any allergies . i had no idea what he was talking about . " food allergies " , he explained . i thanked him and said no , and figured there must be some very delicate souls in the neighborhood . then i noticed a lot of gluten-free items on the menu . i don ' t know what gluten is , but i want mine , and happily there ' s plenty of gluten too . the food is simply perfection . the wine i had , the rose , was fantastic . believe me , i ' ll be back there whenever possible . oh ! and the prices are amazingly reasonable . 
prepare to be nickle and dimed . it ' s an all-right place to eat for the ambiance food . but just one change or special request will result in extra charges . i mean really - charging extra for bread , especially when it ' s taken over an hour for the food to come out ? and then to be ignored by the staff and management ? save your mood money and find another place to eat . . . there are so many good ones in montclair . if it ' s peruvian you ' re after , there are so many other more authentic options around the area that this place just isn ' t worth it . 
mcladdens has such a great atmosphere . my husband and i tend to come in on sundays - he loves how many beers are on tap ! the service is also great - there has been the same girl waitressing each sunday , and she couldn ' t be more helpful with the tap selections ! definitely making this our regular sunday spot ! 
please see xanga . com feed moonbunny for my review , complete with yummy-licious pictures ! ( a feature i desperately wish yelp had ) 
great place to eat at . been a few different times and every time i def have the thai glazed wings . great desserts and burgers too . only knock is them not having bigger screens for the eagles games ! 
went for lunch . food bland . appetizer dumplings terrible . used to go long time ago . very disappointed since this used to be a good place . 
good breakfast especially pancakes with bacon i ' ll get there soon what ' s cooking good looking . ! 
my wife and i went to tashan for dinner . the food and service were fantastic . the boar chops were exceptionally delicious . 
i loved this place . . . i would recommend this place to everybody . . . awesome experience . . 
worst pizza ever . it came an hour after we ordered it and it came burnt and paper thin . and only after they overcharged us . don ' t order from here unless you like paper thin burnt pizza from a place that over charges you and takes more than an hour to deliver it . so ridiculous ! 
one of my favorite brunches in the city has to be the stoop brunch at scratchbread in bed-stuy . for most , it ' s a hike , but there ' s something fantastic about milling around the sidewalks outside the ordering window , eavesdropping on other brooklynites discussing how their twin peaks tattoos were misconstrued as conspiracy theories , and enjoying smashingly unique breakfast treats . delectable menu items include pizza bread , which is thick and delicious with layers of rich tomato sauce , bits of cheese , drizzles of olive oil and red pepper flakes on light , fluffy bread ( the charred edges are the best ! ) the ben , which is usually served on a beautiful looking savory jalapeno muffin , but they ran out , so ours was made with a hollowed out parmesan loaf that was just as delightful , with a perfectly soft-boiled egg , thick slop of " stinky cheese " ( that was actually not that stinky ) , kale for health and added bacon for pure joy . i would just add their soft eggs to everything . they are so perfectly cooked and just lovely ! grits ! scratchbread ' s brilliant version can be dressed up to the nines with kale pesto , wood-charred jalapeno sauce , soft egg , and bacon . you should guss up your grits the whole way too ! it ' s spectacularly spicy , creamy and just so gosh darn good truffle buttercream brownie - brownies sandwiching buttercream and doused in cocoa powder . you deserve it , okay , so treat yourself ! 
this is a sweet spot with just enough to choose from and some delicious mint tea . the platters are fat and definitely will leave you stuffed . the spinach and mushroom pie was delicious and stayed warm during the numerous breaks i took during the meal . outside is deceptive but once you go inside there ' s some nice atrium seating in the back . i definitely need a large nap after this place . i ' d suggest splitting a plate or ensuring enough time for a stroll and your stomach to go back to its normal state . at least it ' s mostly vegetarian ! 
yesterday i searched yelp for some good chinese delivery and reviews pointed towards panda , and i called and they didn ' t pick up . . . so out of desperation and an extreme lack of options , i called these guys instead . i ordered chicken wings with white rice , beef and broccoli with white rice , plain lo mein , and boneless spare ribs with white rice . when the order came i asked the delivery man how much it was and he said N . i gave him N . when i got inside i saw that the receipt read N . so off that alone , i ' ll never be a customer here again no matter how good the food is . unfortunately , the food wasn ' t even good . the chicken wings were old . the chicken tasted like jerky cause it was so dry . the white rice on all of the orders was also old , dry , and borderline hard . the beef and broccoli wasn ' t edible . the sauce was thick , sticky , and tasted like hell . the beef was as chewy as my dentyne ice . some of the broccoli pieces were good , some were mushy . the boneless spare ribs weren ' t the worst i ' ve ever had . they also threw in an egg roll and some random N bodega soda . the egg roll was gross . tasted like it was fried days ago . the only good thing that i have to say is that the lo mein was really tasty . 
i love this place . make a reservation in advance or show up and wait ( often as long as an hour ) , but this place has excellent salads , ribs , and burgers . a modern ambiance , big tables , and lots of art add as well . my only complain is that it ' s still a little pricey , but given that i have no complains , i guess this is justified . 
the green table is such a lovely venue and in the market . food quality was outstanding , reason for N stars is that i thought the portion size could have been a bit bigger esp the ravioli . would def go again ! ! 
awesome thai food . . . . thai ice tea was a little too sweet but everything else was perfect . . . . pad ke mao and massuman curry were awesome ! 
my husband and i just moved to nj from nyc recently and have been on the hunt for good pizza in the area . we went to star tavern based on a recommendation and on all of the great yelp reviews . the place is super casual and noisy . a great place to bring kids . and there were a lot of kids in there . we got there around N . Npm on a friday and the line for a table was super long . we waited about N minutes but grabbed some beers at the bar which made the wait a little better . we just got the regular pie which was pretty decent . like other reviewers said , it was overly greasy for my taste , but it still tasted good . i definitely liked it , but i have to think that there is better pizza in the area . so we will continue our search . 
great place for argentinian food and true experience . they have a large choice of very good red wines , the meat is what you need and expect good piece of meat with no fluff around and sauce only on the side . the waiter had a lot of nice attention and was very patient , not rushing us to finish our meals or order what ' s next . the empanadas are good , though a bit filling . the salad ( N colors ) is very refreshing with the meat , the french fries are homemade and very garlic-ey , so good ! as for the desert , the ' charlotte ' is quite simple ( vanilla ice cream , almond and chocolate ) , but so delicious and don ' t forget the dulce de leche on the side , soo good ! the place in brooklyn is nice , no queue on a friday night , cosy , warm and nice music not too loud . the place is not posh but you can feel that people who are here know fine cuisine or live in the area and are ' usuals ' . overall a great experience , it ' s right around the corner so next time i ' ll try the chicken . they also do brunches and i ' m sure it is damn good too ) 
that awkward moment when you realize that you ' ve redeemed two frequent bahn mi cards and never wrote a review for the place . alas , what can i say that the other N before me haven ' t already covered ? i mean , joju is a great place with a creative bahn mi selection . even with its extensive menu and numerous favorites ( like the bulgogi and pork belly ) i always default to one thing the monster . extra spicy . runny eggs . as with any made to order item , one must be patient . a good bahn mi takes time and the staff work as hard and quickly as possible ( don ' t forget to tip ! college is expensive ! ) . fortunately for me , i call ahead for a pick up . by the time i walk over , my monster is waiting for me . 
solid bar food , well above average beer selection and great service . considering it ' s in the awfully annoyingly crowded section of midtown that i can ' t stand , for me to give this place N stars says a lot about it . i would fight that awful midtown crowd again to have a beer and a bite here . 
we enjoyed lunch here . the portions are small but well presented . service is a little too enthusiastic and friendly . not all that cheap but eating organically is always at a premium . we ' ll be back again . 
will not be coming back to bianca . horrible place service . 
extremely pleased with the quality of food at barn joo . we had all three varieties of their fried chicken ( i respect the fact that they did the plain salt and pepper variety sans sauce ) , pork belly , salmon with yuzu , fries and for dessert , the ginger pudding . all dishes were on point with our favorites being the fried chicken , pork belly and fries . the drinks were delicious as i had several of their elder fashions with friends enjoying hitachino beers . i will be back soon to try the rest of their menu but this is a welcome addition to the korean food scene in manhattan for all types of occasions . 
my favorite spot for duck and for seafood noodles . i been coming here since i was little girl . food is super fast . i usually get the seafood yellow noodles , their noodles is not like regular its super chewy . i love their duck with vinegar sauce . 
so , you walk in to risotteria and the waitress puts a glass of amazing gluten free breadsticks on your table . the breadsticks are light and airy , a little bit salty but not overpoweringly . they are the best gluten free breadsticks ever ! we went on a saturday afternoon and there was no wait . it was a little bit cramped but not too much . the menu is so clear as to what is gluten free , vegetarian and dairy free . i did not have to ask the waitress a ton of questions about the ingredients because next to every gluten-free thing it said " g " . the waitresses and waiters were very helpful and answered all my questions without looking at all frustrated or annoyed . they even make their own gluten-free gorgonzola cheese , which was really nice to know . the food came quickly and was amazing . the risotto was cooked perfectly , not too hard , not too soft . the lemon and pine nut risotto was very good , the lemon was flavorful but not overpowering . . even though it was not a lot of food it was very filling . the desserts are also very good , you would not believe that the eclairs are gluten free . the peanut-butter fudge cupcake was also very good , again you would not believe it was gluten free . overall it was an amazing restaurant and a definite come-again . my only complaint was that the mozzarella cheese in the cheese plate was not very flavorful but everything else was so good that nobody minded . 
best brazilian burgers in newark . what makes this is best is more than just the crazy toppings . you can get that at a bunch of places around here . what makes this place the best is the burgers are actually cooked well . take away the brazilian toppings and you still have a good burger . the patty has a sear and isn ' t cooked all the way through , meaning that it ' s still moist . you can ' t find a regular burger patty cooked so well at any other brazilian place around here . try the x-banana . yes . bananas on the burgers . the bananas are slightly caramelized and compliments the thick slice of mozzarella on the burger . i never thought bananas belonged on a burger . i stand corrected . 
rutts hut is ok . there hot dogs are yucky me and my brother had to spit i out . instead we got a cheeseburger and grilled cheese i liked it but my brother wouldn ' t eat it so we got a cheese and egg sandwich . it was good . then we ordered chocolate pudding . it was sooooo yummy . it is kind of dirty in there and there is know place to sit down just a counter and a smaller one for kids . the one for kids is bad it is very dirty . 
good food , great prices , great karma . stopped by this little kabob house yesterday and the people were really nice . the bartender was incredibly friendly and the food was delicious . the owners are from nepal and have a wonderful disposition as well as plenty of good karma to go around . try a yogurt shake , the pita chips , or a wrap . 
being latino , i find it my duty to find all the good hispanic food in the city . . . i went here with a friend on a saturday evening . the small establishment was packed . we decided to take a seat at the bar style seating ( not an actual bar , just seating with stools along the wall ) , since we would have had to wait for a table ( no reservations taken ) . i ordered N empanadas - the brazil , the " rice and beans " , and a meat filled variety . they were all delicious and enough to fill me up , although i tend to eat less than most people . for dessert i had the apple pie empanada with vanilla ice cream . best part of the meal . it was very tasty and not something i had encountered before as far as empanadas go , so points for creativity . my only two complaints were that my glass of water went empty for a bit , and they don ' t have coat hooks for the bar style seats , so we had to keep moving our jackets so we wouldn ' t have them taking up a seat . on a side note , we stuck to water this time around but we noticed the beers on the menu were N dollars . it would be nice to have a N dollar beer offered . my meal cost me N including tip . the empanadas hover around N-N dollars and the dessert is a little pricier . overall , i definitely enjoyed the food and will be going back for more . 
very good service . . . staff was friendly and professional . the food was very delicious and i plan on coming back soon ! definitely a new favorite . 
i don ' t think this is the original location of the famous lombardi ' s , which claims to be the first pizza restaurant in the whole new york city . nonetheless , we have been to this spring street location twice already and each time we loved it ! the basil pizza is our favorite . the crust is right on the thickness and texture , not too doughy and quite crunchy ! i heard they are very diligent on their water , maybe that ' s why new york pizza wins out , it ' s all in the dough ! 
good atmosphere . fun bar . food is so-so . drinks are a little expensive , but overall a decent place . 
really wonderful food in a nice , open , uncrowded space . delicious hummus , roasted brussel sprouts , and the grilled octopus is awesome . lovely place in flatiron for dinner and drinks . 
we had reservations for a party of nine . drinks and apps came fairly quickly , but dinner was a wait . when we ' d had dessert , the manager came and said he needed our table for another large party . to be fair , he offered to buy us drinks in the bar area , but we wouldn ' t have fit comfortably together there with the size of our party . i ' ve never been pushed out of a dining area like that before , and considering the extended time it took to bring our meal and the amount of cash we dropped , i was embarrassed and appalled . i won ' t book another ' special ' event there again . 
had a terrible experience there with an african american worker tonika she was very rude , rolled here eyes and muttered fowl language i will never eat there again
this place is fantastc . the food is incredible and very reasonably priced . the staff is patient and helpful . and the interior design is stunning . this is a wonderful addition to hell ' s kitchen . 
love , love , love continental . i could eat their food every day . some of my favorite menu items are the tuna tartare , bbq quesadillas , cheesesteak eggrolls , lobster mac ' n ' cheese , lettuce wraps , and the miso glazed sea bass . on top of all the great food is one of the best cocktail menus in town - my favorite drink being the champagne-o-rama . 
great place to order for delivery . . . amazing food , quick service . we got our order in under N minutes . . now its our weekly restaurant . great experience ! 
yelp strikes again in helping me find a hole in the wall ! this is a real mom and pop spot that serves about N different japanese dishes . no fancy sushi or anything and i went for the good ol ' pork tonkatsu . for N i got a huge bowl of rice , a slab of pork that was perfectly breaded and fried , and a handful of greens . you know the tonkatsu is spot on when there ' s no greasiness , fried at a perfect temperature with a little crispiness in the breading , not burnt , and no chewiness in the meat . they don ' t really advertise their hours , i asked and they said N-N everyday . they also do delivery , though we all know fried food tastes well after delivery . will have to work this into my rotation when i ' m looking for some cheap japanese food . 
i love this restaurant , it may be my favorite in N . i don ' t think i ' ve ever had a bad dish and service is excellent . sometimes too excellent , you only have to sip your glass of water for it to be refilled . but who ' s complaining ! actually , drinks come a little slow sometimes and i took one star off because N for that tiny ( yet wonderful ) bloody mary is just a little silly . but i still love it . 
i ' ve attended a lot of business meetings , weddings and parties at bella italia and i must say the staff food are excellent ! the owners are personable and very professional . if you visit orange , you must go to bella italia ! 
great place ! always an enjoyable experience , good staff and great food . love the fish . 
the pork bun appetizer was great . spicy miso ramen was so-so . i will stick to my usual akamaru modern next time . 
i love skinny pancake ! the hardest decision is which crepe to get . i go often on sundays for the bluegrass brunch . they have amazing breakfast crepes but i also love their lunch dinner ones . the josh panda crepe with fried chicken , taters and gravy is a favorite but i also love the pulled pork with rookie ' s root beer bbq sauce . mmm ! makes me hungry even thinking about it . so many dessert crepes and also noncrepe items to choose from . so excited that they doubled their size and now they are a full bar with great live music too ! love having this place in our community ! 
no , i don ' t think so . the location ok , while you wait the hour in line you can look at the manhattan bridge and old warehouses turning into high-end-whatevers . when you are seated you can wait N minutes for the waiter to run past then you wait an hour for your pizza to come , and by that time you are starving and will eat just about anything . worst pizza i ever had , bland and dried out . no taste . half hour later the table was cleared and we asked for the check . the waiter must have gone home for the day ? never saw him again . an hour later we asked a burly man who appeared to be the owner if we could get our check , and he says , " could these nice people have their check please ? i have to bother one of the waiters for their check ! some people think they are the only ones in the restaurant ! " yeah . ok . N hours of waiting for a really bad pizza to be told we are impatient . nah , i don ' t think so . 
i walk by this place all the time when i ' m in les and finally got the chance to eat here . i ' m glad i came . my friend and i arrived fairly late at N N and still there was a N minute wait for a table of N ( only in nyc . . . ) . but the place is fairly small , and packed . you really have to squeeze by tables and chairs to get anywhere . i wouldn ' t recommend groups larger than N-N . as we were waiting we grabbed margaritas at the bar , they were alright . it was N for one . when we sat down we ordered N tacos and guacamole . we had the lamb , pork , steak , fish , and chorizo . they were all delicious at N per taco . they were a good size for a taco too . they were all quite flavorful , the lamb was my favorite . the guacamole was was alright , slightly bland and plain . not worth N if you ask me . will definitely be back to eat more tacos and try some other dishes . 
in my opinion , the best pizza in hartford . i have always liked the food , and i enjoy the atmosphere . 
the bartender with the beard and the dark hair is one of the rudest bartenders i have ever encountered ! he always has an attitude , makes pissy comments to customers and put my food and drinks on my sister ' s tab because we had the same last name " and he couldn ' t tell which one was which in the system ! " so you ' re telling me if two people with the same last name come into this establishment and start a tab you have absolutely no way of distinguishing them nj the computer system ? complete bs . i ' m sure people complain about him , and yet he keeps his job . perhaps he ' s better suited for another position in the restaurant ? all bar owners must be aware that the bartenders can make or break their business . this bartender is hurting this business . otherwise , the food is amazing ! they need a better selection of beer but i can deal with it . good addition to the city . 
not a bad place to go . my wife and i tried several menu items and most were decent . m t he pasta could have been more firm . it was not al dente . the place seemed kind of crowed but we had no problem getting a seat . what is also very nice is that it is byob . that saved a lot . 
horrible service . we decided to give it a try last saturday since they just opened and wanted to support their business . found out later it was a bad decision . the service was so slow . we waited for more than N minutes and none of the burgers or the fries were served yet . we decided to ask for the manager . she wasn ' t very helpful either . rather than reassuring us about the food to come out soon , she justified their slow service . ended up going next door to chipotle instead . never again . . 
smashing with hint of brilliance . being a fan of the seriously underrated pork belly , i soon realized i had potentially found something special hidden in between thai houses , bail bondsmen and across from the infamous detention hell-hole the tombs . small but respectable size for those new yorkers that know good meals usually come in small places . very friendly staff , brian will happily walk you through some pork belly stories . music a bit loud but you quickly realize it fits , it ' s ok , it no longer bothers you . initially thought of take-out but rashly decided it was quite comfortable within its confines . the menu is overwhelmingly peppered with pork belly all over the place . making it hard to stay committed to one selection . i opted for the breakroom burger . covered most bases , while yet still safe if this place was to suck and these couple hundred reviewers were wrong . brian quickly presented me with my investment and added that i may want to order another item before moving on . knowing that soon enough this customer would be weeping and salivating . was not far from truth . guilt kept me from dropping my guard and feasting but vowed to return . do it . worth trip there and definitely nothing around there that compares . i wish they had a street meat extension or truck ! ! ! 
excellent food ! and the people are so gently . the bread , the veal , the pasta . . . everything was very good . 
city steam was the first stop on our pub crawl this past saturday . it was extraordinarily busy as the uconn women were in town . the pub crawl drink special was an onyx moonshine drink , mixed with pink lemonade . it was made very well and tasty . i had a sip of someone else ' s as it is a borderline crime not to have one of city steam ' s in-house brews . i ordered a naughty nurse , and as usual , it was bursting with flavor and refreshing . it went really well with the waffle fries , fried pickles , and nachos we ordered . the waffle fries were golden and crispy , even after cooling down a bit . city steam ' s fried pickles are the best around , and i get them every time i go . fried to perfection with an awesomely spiced batter ( i ask for hot sauce with mine ! ) . the nachos were served with a good quality sour cream and a fresh tomato blend that almost tasted like what you ' d use on bruschetta- very flavorful ! even though it was crazy busy , our bartender was on point , efficient , and having a good time with us . the food came out hot , despite the kitchen being slammed . i highly recommend city steam if you ' re looking for a great , local brew , a quality menu ( with plenty of options for vegetarians ) that compliments their brews , and awesome service . 
cheap . wide variety of korean food . fast . and in terms of the authenticity of korean food ( which is probably never gonna happen in nyc , purely because the main ingredients are different from those in korea ) , i personally think it ' s way better than those other korea town restaurants . and because these food are cooked right before placed on the stove ( ? ) , i get less concerned about all those food doubts and all . 
want to know how to get kids ( or adults ) to eat their vegetables ? especially dark leafy greens ? serve them with bacon and pork -- good fork style -- and they ' ll be gobbling them up . i had to come down to red hook after watching the dumpling throwdown with bobby flay . we ordered the winning pork and chive dumplings and crabcake as appetizers . the dumplings were juicy and delicious and very much reminded me the dumplings that my mother used to make . the crabcake was mostly crabmeat and not filler . delicious ! but what really shined in the meal was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with kale . seriously , one of the best meals of my life . the bacon was smoky perfection and brought out the full pork essence of the tenderloin . the meat was so juicy and moist . and the kale was just incredible ! wonderful romantic little date place , especially if you ' re lucky and get one of the two cozy curved booth seating by the windows . 
delicious burgers and great service . i cannot wait to come back here ! 
nope
yes , this place has huge portions but all the dishes are over sauced . if i wanted soup i would have ordered soup ! also , i used to come for lunch or dinner and spend a good amount of money at least N time a week and never once did i get a free refill or even N break on my bill . i ' m not asking for any favors or freebees , but that is not the way to keep customers . i haven ' t been there in a while but i also heard they raised all the prices and now charge for every little things , as well as some changes made to dish ingredients . people used to like this place because of the good food , low prices , and good company . . . which it now has none of the above . 
pat ' s cheesesteaks is so foul and rancid it made me wish i could turn back the hands of time , rewriting history , and have the british succeed in their invasion to reclaim america . thus preventing the formation of philadelphia , and therefore , saving the world from ever suffering from this gastrointestinal horror , aka pats cheesesteaks . 
thank god . a coffee shop in fishtown with soul , good coffee , an owner with personality and great music . just what was needed . 
when i wan ' t roast pork sandwiches i have to go to south philly ( no other part of the city does it better ) when in south philly it has to be john ' s roast pork . no one does it better period i was turned on to the place about N years ago and put them on speed dial that day . 
you say ' bo ' i say ' ssam ' you ' bo ' me ' ssam ' together now ' bo ' ' ssam ' -- ok , clearly i was never a cheerleader . . . but i am a huge huge fan of this dish . . . i thought bruni was exaggerating . . . but it is so worth getting N of your closest friends ( or even people you may not like but can handle sitting through a meal with as long as they have the cash to pay for their own meal . . . ) chang ' s bo ssam is not what i ' ve grown up with where you might see all the old men sitting around the table on the floor with pork slices and little sides of anchovies and various kimchee and pan chan . . . but this non traditional version doesn ' t disappoint . the pork is indescribably tender . . . clearly they slow roasted that hunk of meat until it became the tender slab of heaven that they present before you . they give you these little tongs and the pork just falls right off the bone - it isn ' t salted and instead of little anchovies they give you a little dish of sea salt , prepared gochujang , kimchee puree , scallion ( and ginger ? ) vinegarette sauce , kimchee and boston lettuce leaves to wrap the meat . seriously , i ' m not literate enough to do it justice , you have to just go and try it , it really is that amazing . . . the other dishes we had were amazing as well - i had been there once before and had really enjoyed the food . . . but man , i ' m bummed that it takes so much planning for the bo ssam . the pork buns are also delicious - a sleeker version of what you ' d get if you went to a traditional dim sum house . . . with two slices of what looked like pork belly - tender , with slices of cucumber and a slathering of sweet hoisin sauce- in a clam shaped rice bun . the banh mi was also very good - with a layer of pate ( chicken ? ) - and layers of veggies ( cucumbers , carrots daikon ? ) in a crunchy italian style loaf bread . . . we also had the beef tendon , which is good but i didn ' t love because i ' m afraid i ' m not the biggest fan of cilantro - something i inherited from my mom , it makes us gag and this dish has a very strong cilantro flavor infused throughout - but the people at the table liked it . but if there was a dish that rivaled the pork -although this was very small and would not feed N people and you probably won ' t want to share it , it is that good - the cured hamachi , comes with thin , tender slices ( N ) of sashimi topped with i think roasted soy beans and crumbled sea weed . . . there ' s a wasabi foam on the plate . . . seriously , get thee over there and order this dish immediately . usually with a meal like this , you think the desserts will disappoint . . . but they didn ' t ! ! we had the peanut butter and jelly - something . . . if you like peanut butter , it ' s like a peanut butter explosion in your mouth . . . and the blondie which had a yummy caramel flavor - but i preferred the peanut butter and jelly dessert . all of these starters - which was enough for everyone in our table of N to have and N beers ( oh , gripe- no hot tea , not even barley ) with enough pork left over for N people to take home with them was N person ! in order the have the pork butt bo ssam , you have to ' pre-order ' and they tell you the slots they have open which are only very early ( N N ) or very late ( Npmish ) - and they do have weekend slots- but the popular dining times they leave for the regular menu - but the number to call is their office at N . N . N . . . 
i do like this place . easy to get to and good food
pathetic overpriced cannolis ( N for N small ) . . . the cream was tasteless might as well be rediwhip and came with some useless bluberry jelly , actually the jelly was probably the best part , but really what ass backwards italians eat cannoli ' s with blueberry sauce . for the price of these garbage desserts i might as well have rented a car and drove to boston for some legit italian pastries , fml . . the regular food was sitting out under a glass display and didnt even look as good as sbarro , flies weren ' t even appetized . the tiramisu was pretty good but for N it should ' ve been a top N dessert ever but dosn ' t even crack top N . about N blocks in the distance you can see times square and that should be a big enough red flag that this is a tourist trap . . craving a cannoli at N pm will lead you to trouble
this is the type of restaurant i ' d love to open in the future . it ' s tucked away on the corner of N streets with enough seats for N , max . it ' s a cozy candle-lit spot , subdued with rustic elegance reminiscent of a quaint farmhouse transported to the west village . service was great , as the waitress hostess was around just enough and very friendly . this place is apparently famous for its meatball sliders , and i can see why each bite results in a juicy well-seasoned explosion of beef pork veal , with just enough sauce to soften the bread ' s texture without causing it to disintegrate . i had the largest pork chop of my life , served on the bone and cooked perfectly without any semblance of dryness , over a bed of dandelion greens and half-mashed lima beans with a delicious vinagrette to cut through all the meatiness . we ordered one of every side sauteed mixed mushrooms with truffle oil ( as good at it sounds if you love truffles ) , grilled asparagus ( solid ) , chive mashed potatoes ( decent but nothing special ) , fries with chili aioli ( scrumptious ) , and mexican corn taken off the cob ( not as good as papatzul or cafe habana , but those are hard to beat ) . the halibut with pesto vinagrette was also excellent . desserts were beignets ( really more like high-end cake munchkins than true new orleans beignet ) with raspberry jam and nutella and a root beer float ( N thumbs up just for offering this ) . great date place or if you ' re in the mood for a delicious meal in a comfy setting , just make sure you have reservations . 
butcher bar has it all and will be complete when they get the liquor license . i ate with a bunch of my friends and ordered close to everything on the menu . the highlights were the ribs , brisk , sausage , pulled chichen and mac n cheese . we all treked in from bk and manhattan which was a quick train ride and very worth it . if you like organic or just awesome food you need to go here asap . 
 free chips and salsa while you wait holy guacamole . i ordered the grilled chicken burrito with guacamole and chips . the burrito was well filled but not to the bursting point and oh so tasty ! but the star for me was the guacamole . oh man this stuff is the shiz --dear ol shiz --holy crap --amazing guacamole . i might have to try their vegetarian dishes though --just to see what the fuss is all about . 
junior ' s cheesecake is one of my best hang out place , the cakes and the dessert are the best and the taste and sweetness of the cakes makes people from all around the world travel just to taste junior ' s extraordinary dessert . 
i miss papa frank ' s . when i lived in burlington this was a great place to go for " american-style " italian food . it ' s nothing fancy , just a great little hole in the wall pizza joint with comfort food . i know it ' s hard to compare papa frank ' s when you ' ve had italian food in the bigger east coast cities . my advice to you , don ' t . just enjoy the restaurant for what it is , you will like it . 
we ate at the bar which is great because you get to talk to the chefs and get a show . the tables are barbuzzo are a bit cramped . we ordered bone marrow , asparago pizza , mushroom pesto pasta , meatballs , and grilled octopus squid . the bone marrow was rich and decadent but a bit much for the N of us . the pizza was good , but i wish the crust was chewier . the meatballs were disappointing , i wouldn ' t order them again . the grilled octopus squid however was amazing . both were incredibly tender . grilled calamari is one of my favorite foods and this did not disappoint . for dessert we got the budino and the chocolate tasting . both were good . next time i would like to try the ricotta and another of the pastas . 
the concierge in my hotel recommended this place . i go there about Nam on a sunday morning i think and there was already a small queue . it was worth the wait for a great american pancake breakfast experience . i ordered pancakes expecting a couple of robust offerings . when the plate arrived there were N or N good size pancakes , a mound cream and bananas and syrup on the side . i ate about half of it and was full . 
i found a big bug in my spring roll . when i took the food back to the restaurant , i asked for my money back . . . instead the owner ( i assume ) provided the worst customer service ever ! ! ! ! she accused me of putting the bug in my food . she accused me of being hard up for money ( uh . . . i pd for the food . . . how would that make me hard up ? ? ? ) she then called the police ( to make them decide if she could refund me ) . i ' ve never experienced this level of poor customer service in my life . i will never patronize this business again ! 
i highly recommend checking out the runner . last night was my first dining experience at this new restaurant and i will definitely be going back . the design of the restaurant was great , i loved the bar , wood burning oven , the ceiling , and exposed brick . the staff was all very nice , attentive and informative . the food is awesome ! i absolutely loved the chicken pate , tarte flambe ( flat bread ) , butternut squash soup , popovers and brussel sprouts to start . for the main course i thought the whole chicken for two was literally the most well cooked and delicious chicken i have ever eaten . no exaggeration . . . order the chicken ! the salt baked trout was amazing as well . i also loved the cauliflower and white beans with duck confit . and lastly for dessert , do not miss the carrot pudding . we sat at the chef ' s table and chatted with chef andrew , he was super friendly and it was fun watching him prepare cook our food . i live in nyc but it is worth making the trip to the runner , you won ' t regret it . i also recommend to people who are attending a concert or sporting event at barclay ' s center to eat here without a doubt . its slightly over a mile away and worth the N min cab . worth checking out and i will certainly be back . 
i am a fan of artichoke pizza . not only are the usually open until late , but the pizzas are usually very fresh . the pricing is steep for a slice , upwards of N , but definitely worth it given the portions of a slice and the deliciousness of the food . if it was cheaper , i would give it N stars , but a solid N none the less . 
i went to bokhara recently and did not like the service what so ever , it took way to long . after waiting for about an hour the food was not good at all , the rice was very dry and the lamb wasn ' t cooked all the way . and also the prices are very very high . do yourself and your wallet a favor and do not eat there . 
the rolls are amazing they combine the right amount of indian spices without making them too messy . my favorites are chicken tikka and shrimp masala both are amazing . my only issue is sometimes the service is slow because they only have N person actually making the rolls . 
two friends and i had a brunch reservation . the waitstaff were kind enough to seat me early and alone when i arrived before the rest of my party . i ordered a coffee and waited . the coffee arrived with a little pitcher of cream and no spoon . i checked my napkin roll . there was a fork and knife but no spoon . sometimes attention to detail goes along way for me . as for food , i ordered the two eggs , potatoes , and the fruit plate as a side . my friends went with the eggs florentine and another two eggs , potato and a side . the restaurant was half full but the food took quite a while to come out . the food was plated beautifully , however was under seasoned and we had to ask for salt and pepper for the table . the potatoes were delicious and crisp . the fruit plate was nice . it had a bit of honey , a streak of yogurt and sliced fruit . again , it would have been nice to have a spoon . all and all , i think i have had better service ( and spoons ) at greasy spoon diners . the food was decent here and i appreciate seasonal and farm to table food . despite all this the experience was just ok . 
been ther in the winter really fresh fish and great grilled calamari not many palces i like this is one of N
the place is pretty tiny , so once you step inside the bright red door you have to wait about ten to fifteen minutes to be seated . as we were waiting , i saw that the daily special was apple cinnamon pancakes and knew i would barely have to look at the menu after seeing that . the toughest choice was deciding what size i knew one large pancake wouldn ' t cut it ( especially not after that long walk ! ) , and thought three small would be too little as well , so i went with the three large . they were huge ( took up an entire plate ) . while i tried to convince myself i wouldn ' t finish them , i ended up leaving behind an empty plate . i think N pancakes would have been the perfect amount because i was stuffed afterwards . my pancakes were very reasonably priced at N . N . while the pancake itself was fluffy , thick , sweet , and delicious , i was a little underwhelmed by the apple cinnamon part of it . my mom also makes apple cinnamon pancakes , so i had high expectations , and have to say i like my mom ' s a lot better . the apples were a little tart , and there wasn ' t much sweetness or cinnamon . with maple syrup and the melted butter on top , it still tasted like a good pancake , but i expected much more from the apple cinnamon . we split a large plate of very fresh , juicy , sweet strawberries for N . N , and my friends each got generous helpings of eggs for around N . each came with homefries , which were cooked perfectly ( crispy outside but soft inside ) and very flavorful , and my friend couldn ' t stop raving about her spinach and feta omelette . i loved the decoration inside the walls were plastered with posters of jazz festivals . it felt like a cozy , home-y diner . while it didn ' t quite meet my expectations , it was still pretty good brunch food and makes for a lovely walk ( especially if you take the residential streets-route , with fall leaves blanketing the ground ) . not to mention , you don ' t really have many other options for good brunch in new haven . 
good little place for a well-priced bite to eat . food is made quickly and is really good . we had several different items and all were tasty . it also can be a great place to meet up and get some work done with a colleague . i was there for a good couple hours and no one on the staff made us feel unwelcome . it ' s not a loud place so it ' s easy to converse and have a meeting . be careful and look inside your roll before taking a bite- they accidentally gave my colleague beef ! and she doesn ' t eat beef . that was the only real downside . 
most delicious pizza . thankfully mancinni ' s is directly across the street from swapxxchange , so we are able to order lunch at least twice a week . the sausage pizza is delicious , as well as some of the most interesting pickled mushrooms . i could eat their pizza every day . . . 
one of the many courses that i ate was a delicately prepared ( as they all are ) piece of fish , possibly turbot , that was served with a light cucumber-based sauce . upon smelling it and taking the bite , i was immediately reminded a sort of novelty apron that my grandmother had . the apron was white with hand-painted flowers ( it was the Ns ) , each of which had the name and phone number of a restaurant in the town my grandparents lived . i had not thought about this apron for at least N years . but the smell of the cucumbers was so distinct and so perfect , it reminded me exactly of my grandmother ' s garden . few meals , let alone courses , have brought back such distant and wonderful memories . 
was great to get a table outside and relax over a couple of serbian beers . we ordered a grilled sardine special which was perfectly charred on the outside , moist and flakey on the inside . we also shared a plate of mixed grill meats , which were heavy on the pork . everything was well seasoned and cooked , although a bit heavy handed on the salt and well doneness on the meat . that aside , the flavors were right . would come back again . 
good pizza , nice family restaurant . there has not been a pizza i haven ' t liked here . the only annoyance is that its cash only . 
went there for dinner on a whim with my fiance . food just ok . not bad but nothing to brag about either . 
the best ramen in the east coast , man . . . . the best ramen in the east coast ! totto miso ramen with spicy sauce on the side . . . it ' s like a match for the gods mario and peach , zelda and link , ash ketchum and pikachu . . . you get the idea . although the wait in line was an hour and N min when we were told to wait only N . . . our whole entourage of N people decided to brave out the long wait by looking at people ' s parking , taking pictures of a dead chicken in front of the restaurant dropped by the store manager transporting ingredients , etc . when they called our names , they said " really ? you really are here ? " lolol as you walk in you see the chefs using torches . . . torches ! to cook the chashu for the ramen . damn , that ' s dedication . ramen bowls were lined up ready to hold the magical broth and golden noodles known as ramen . and like i said above the ramen is f n good . so come here wait in line , don ' t be a b and wait for the best ramen you ' ll ever have in ny
i wish there was a N . N star option . i like the place -- the food i ' ve tried is tasty , the drinks are fun , and i ' ve always had good service here . the only time i dined here , i found the food prices to be ok . since their plates are small and shareable , some of the selections seem a bit overpriced for the amount of food you receive . on the other hand , dishes like the oh-so-creamy lobster mac and cheese are large and hearty . now , i only really go to continental midtown for drinks . . . it ' s a fun place to bring out-of-town visitors . 
i had heard a lot about joe ' s shanghai from friends and so some of us went to check it out around Npm . luckily , we found seating right away . i ' ve heard that those who come at peak hours are not so lucky . we had mostly soup dumplings ( we ordered N orders of N , or something like that ) and the rest of the meal consisted of beef fried rice . i found the beef fried rice to be pretty average , but the soup dumplings were among the best i ' ve ever had . i can ' t tell for sure if it was the best i ' ve ever had , because i ' ve never gone to a place in which the majority of my meal consisted of soup dumplings . it could just be that i liked it here so much because i had so much of them . nevertheless , the quality was very high . 
saw a crowd outside so we wandered in a for a drink . . . a mixed drink that turned out to be very small and watery . the place was full and yet dead . they were playing some depressing classic hair rock downtstairs . we went upstairs and it was even more depressing - karaoke night . ughh . 
i ' ve been wanting to try this place for quite some time given the stellar yelp reviews . after finally squeaking through the door last night just before N pm , i can now say i agree with its good reputation ! it is truly a gem in the neighborhood . i love that it is byob . at N . N a plate , sky cafe boasts street food prices , but the dining area is nicer than i expected given the cheap prices it ' s clean , comfortable , and well-decorated . although my friend had to take my order over the phone at N N as i rushed there before closing , the waiter was patient and excellent at recommending a vegetarian dish i would enjoy . he was very helpful and polite and he never made us feel rushed . now , on to the food . everything was fresh and arrived speedily to the table . my friends both got the mie kepiting ( homemade egg noodles with crab meat ) . the noodles were phenomenal a delightful and unique combination of texture and flavor . the noodles and crab meat are in one bowl , and the broth is served on the side , so you can pour it in to suit your ideal ratio of noodles broth . i got the nasi urap with what were described to me as " stinky beans " ( i did not find them very stinky at all , which is a good thing ) . the beans came in a rich , spicy , coconutty sauce that i absolutely adored . the plate came with a nest of assorted crispy fried vegetables , which complimented the texture of the beans and rice perfectly . i was a little disappointed there were not more vegetarian items on the menu , considering the many vegan options available at other indonesian restaurants in the area , but apparently they can make several dishes to order , so i would love to come back and try a vegetarian version of the noodles if they have it . i ' m so glad i finally tried this place ! i ' ll be back for sure . 
the waitress messed up my order , but what she gave me was still great . as earlier reviewers mentioned , the waffle fries were delicious , and i loved the " hug mug " of the hot chocolate ! my date and i also enjoyed the fondue selection . 
two words sangria and cheese bread . bomb
after having their chicken rice once , i ' m totally hooked ! it ' s the type of dish that you find yourself craving on late nights . . . wonderful food , very fast service . i wish they ' d open a branch closer to me ! 
this bar is not what it once was . i ' ve been going to tattooed mom ' s for ten years . it used to be a crowded , kind of divey place where you could get some cheap vegetarian food . now it ' s an overpriced waste of time . in the last year , the prices have shot up and with the same shitty , arrogant waitstaff , it ' s not worth it . you can get much better food for less money and less attitude elsewhere . my cheese fries were N , came out cold , and had less than a spoonful of cheese stuck on top . N for a shitty veg chicken patty on a bun ? you ' ve got to be kidding me . plus i have to practically stand on my table to get the server to even glance in my direction . c ' mon . there ' s so many other places to go around here , why bother with this place ? 
i ' ve been here several times and i ' ve never been disappointed . i love their tortilla soup , the empanadas , and pretty much anything on the brunch menu . for dessert , the xangos are amazing . the last time i was there , when the waitress brought the dessert menu , i knew i wouldn ' t be able to resist , even though i was already stuffed . also , great atmosphere . i love the lighting and the decorations , though it does get a bit cramped sometimes . it ' s not exactly a place to just pop into when you feel like grabbing some cheap food , but honestly , i come here even when i can ' t afford it . yum . 
the soy garlic chicken wing is a must have . and the jasmine green bubble tea . 
went here last night with my husband and his parents and was pleasantly surprised ! i read the yelp reviews and decided on " da andrea " and am so happy i did . the service was wonderful , they were very attentive , but not annoying . made sure our water glasses were always full and that the food came out in a timely manner . N out of the N of us had pasta and it was yummy . as other yelpers have mentioned , all their pasta is homemade and you can definitely taste the difference . it really was great . overall , a lovely little restaurant that i will definitely be coming back to . thanks yelpers for sending me here ! ! 
great place ! ! the slaw dog is sooo good ! ! 
this was my boyfriend and i first experience in fogo . next time we go , we need to formulate a strategy . i wanted to eat more so much , but i got full from all the deliciousness . i had most of my cuts of meat rare ( my plate was like fetish night at the dahmer house ) and my boyfriend had medium . both were absolutely delicious . i barely touched the sides so i have no idea what they taste like . i just want more bloody , bloody meat on my plate ! 
carlo raoul momo ( ref mediterra , teresa ' s , witherspoon bread co ) just opened eno terra eh-no teh-rah on entering kingston ( nj ) from princeton , at foot of hill . . . next to d r canal . ( former " wine press " , but now completely changed ! ) food and setting are both extremely ' tasteful ' . selections focus on local suppliers ( high quality ) , absolutely fresh . menu varies depending on season local availability . we had a perfect salad ( heirloom tomatoes , baby beets , pickled onions toasted pine nuts on fresh greens w chianti vinaigrette dressing ) , with a sampling of meats ( " simply grazin " new york strip , " stoltfus farm " pork loin " carlisle farm house " spiced lamb sausage ) , all on a bed of local veggies herbs . various breads from " witherspoon bread company " served w dinner ( complemented w olive oil some kind of special pate ? , latter which i can not id ) . desert . . . fresh baked black pepper pound cake , w peach compote from " terhune orchards " fresh nj blueberries . . . oh w dollop of sumptuous " bent spoon " gelato that made me think i was in italy ! lest you ask , no , meals this good are not inexpensive . . . but i think pricing honest fair --- i ' ve paid " more " but gotten " less " elsewhere . ( i don ' t drink alcohol , so i can not comment on eno terra ' s wines . . . but a rather wide selection of wines is also a specific focus of this restaurant . ) presuming you may have eaten at the momo ' s mediterra restaurant , eno terra will not " surprise " you by it ' s quality in all regards . wonderful dining all around . . . again , " tasteful " setting , food , service . highly recommended . ( nb i " know " the momos by virtue of having eaten at their restaurants . ) 
hugely disappointing . i get the distinct impression this place used to be second to none in the upper valley , but even a reasonably-tasty pizza doesn ' t offset the poor quality of service . when you have to repeat yourself a fourth time , it isn ' t a case of " can ' t hear , " it ' s a case of " don ' t care if i hear . " the staff ( and more to the point , management ) just isn ' t making any effort , and it shows . head on over to ramunto ' s --the parking may be trickier , but the pizza is every bit as good ( and there ' s frankly a far better selection ) , the atmosphere is a little more inviting , and more importantly the service is N better . 
worst service that i ever received ! N ) i was over charged for my pizza N ) i didn ' t get the online discount N ) i had to wait about an hour for the pizza N ) when i asked why my order was taking soo long i was verbally assulted ( probably for making them look bad in front of customers ) N ) my pizza was cold and greasy so zero stars ! if i could . . . 
on a cold winter ' s night , i ventured to great jones cafe on a whim , and luckily there was no wait around N N p . m . for a table for three . this place is boss ! we got very lucky because not soon after there were N people waiting around the bar for a table to open up . we started with a round of vodka lemonades which were ridiculous and potent . for our appetizer , we sampled the wings ( the sauce is their secret ) and cornbread ( not too dry or sweet - so good ! ) the mains were jambalaya , catfish and their pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries . seriously it was so good , well executed , and reasonably priced . my only critique is that the food is very heavy , so be prepared ! 
super cute little cafe with nice light and a cool eclectic menu ( homemade tofu ? vegan tahini cookies ? rice balls ? ) the peppermint iced tea comes with fresh peppermint leaves . it ' s got an out-of-the-way , undiscovered feel - case in point , i am writing this review at N pm on a weekday and am the only person in here ! 
the corner foodery ( N sansom ) is a great place to go with friends . the staff is cheerful and they seem happy . the bottled beer selection is epic , and they bring some tasty beer on tap . the interior makes the corner foodery shine through , with what seems like solid wood tables , giving it that nice sleek natural look , it ' s a nice contrast against an ever mechanical , smoggy , techy city . a nice relief . i ' ve had the meatball , sausage and pepper , mortadella , tuna fish and egg , and prosciutto hoagies . all the sandwiches were very tasty , and exclusively unique except for the sausage and peppers , it was simply a well made sausage and pepper sandwich . the tuna was amazing , but unfortunately it was too dry . i would avoid these two unless they have been updated . when they first opened they seemed to be putting manchego cheese on one of their sams and it was amazing , i ' m not sure which sandwich it was anymore , but anything with manchego is a steal . the best i had was the prosciutto . the taste of the bread was great too , as it ' s essential to any great sandwich . when i took my friends and family here they loved the sides starters the most . i have to admit they are almost better than some of the sandwiches , so don ' t forget to try these . i recommend the roasted peppers with pine puts . good stuff ! 
great food , great service , and fair prices . you can ' t go wrong ordering here
i guess if you order the drinks on their menu , they are great . but if you go in there and ask for a cocktail that is different- even a classic one like a french N- they are incapable . it was watered down champagne . nothing artisan about that . 
i really like this place . the flatiron needs more solid neighborhood joints almond . i live around the corner so i ' ve been in a few times-ranging from cocktails and oysters at the bar to full-on meals . vibe is relaxed , the staff is earnest , and food is great . the menu ranges from bistro classics to northern italian , with some esoterica thrown around . the prices are totally resonsible . the specials get a bit pricey , but if you stick with the regular menu you can get out of there paying about N a person
amazing place that really gives back to the community the owner is a N star person amazing good prices and you get a lot of food order something with bacon and get N strips they also do lunch its a small place but long , they open at N am its right next to the fire house on main street in hartford its really a great place
never fails , every time i take a bite of these absolutely beautiful delights somehow all my worries disappear ! ! loving the new adorable cylinder boxes with the pink bows it ' s like receiving a little present ! 
i often order the pizza for a pickup as the table service is not all that great . but being locked up all weekend at home because of the cold . my husband and i decided to dine in and take a chance . well , we were lucky to get an older experienced italian waiter ( david ) who really knows beer , wine and food pairing . as to his advice we ordered a margherita and the special pizza N with this mild flavor panchetta . both came out promptly . the flavor of both was delicious , especially the the N . the crust was not too chewy but more along the line of what might find at motorino in the city . also our margherita was a top contender too ! for desserts he brought out their very own cheese cake to die for . wherever you are , it ' s worth a trip to the dumbo to taste their traditional neapolitan pies . 
i decided to return home to philly and since i grew up in this house i went to figs to see what they did to my old house . the food was great and i really enjoyed eating here . when i do return to philly i will be back to eat again at figs
greeting- immediate vibe- i can ' t believe this place is here price- good bathroom- fail parking- street service- very good , friendly but server has no clue about the food wine- byob food- all portions are huge fried calamari is awful . giant frozen cuttlefish rings gnocchi is not homemade as server said . if i am wrong please let me know . it looks and tastes like the typical store bought type N . one portion enough for four people stuffed hot peppers were not good . what are they stuffed with ? loin veal chop N is big and tasty . served with a huge side of broccoli rabe and a baked potato cannoli N is not good . stale shell and paste like filling huge slice of pumpkin pie with vanilla ice cream is good wigb ? only if i was in the neighborhood . overall- for this location near the prudential center , this might be the only italian food restaurant selection . if this is so and you go here i would get the entrees and pastas not the apps . they make you feel welcome here . that is why i give it two stars and not one . 
my friends and i tried to dine here and were told we could not go in this had never happened before so we asked , " why ? " . we were told by the man at the door that he didn ' t have to tell us why and to leave the front of their establishment . there were N of us all ethnic woman . he then proceeded to let asian and caucasian people in and was very rude to us again . then , N african american men approached the establishment and were treated the same way . another group of african american men showed up ( one of which was an nfl player ) and the rude door man told them ( obviously not recognizing the pro athlete ) that their " attire was inappropriate " when we could clearly see through the window that some caucasian men were dining in the same type of urban attire . then to make matters worse we called while standing there to make reservations and were told that they were " full to capacity " , meanwhile we could see the N empty tables through the window smh . this establishment leaves me no choice but to believe that they are racist . i hate to say it but racism is obviously still affecting lives in N . 
let ' s put it this way i am dying for an opportunity to go back . i love tea , and it was great to find this adorable tea house with charming decor and great matcha green tea ! ! yum ! i didn ' t eat too much , but my friend did and he said it was good . . . and it looked like a tempting menu indeed . great place to hang with a friend
N . N stars . i had the pulled pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe . while the sandwich is not bad , at N dollars , it ' s vastly overpriced for what it is . with so many other options available at reading terminal market , you should probably save your stomach space for something more delicious ( i . e . donuts ) , though i do think you could make it if you share with someone . 
i will say this about umami burger the bun is an otherworldly , transcendent masterpiece of baking . you will dream about the bun - not just because of the " u " branded on it ( how do they do that anyway ? ) it is perfectly fresh , plump and toothsome - and not too big . i sort of wanted to eat just the bun . the rest of the experience can be summed up as follows things i liked dipping sauces to accompany the fries ( aioli , ketchup , yogurt sauce , etc ) . reasonably sized burgers . for once , the burger actually fits in your mouth and doesn ' t fall in your lap . hot , crispy fries , mcdonald ' s-thin style . the consistency of the burger - heavenly , dare i say . things that were lame the parmesan crisp did nothing and tasted like nothing . the classic umami burger had just the crisp and an insignificant smear of umami ketchup ( bland ) , and a few smitherings of tomatoes , grilled onions and mushrooms . in other words , this burger was short on flavor despite all these toppings . either step up the seasoning or put more stuff on there . . . but that would ruin the perfect size . . . problems , problems . the truffle fries - they tasted good , but they needed more cheese sauce . yes , sauce . the cheese was a borderline creepy queso-like consistency . the fried pickles we got as an appetizer seriously were not pickled at all . they were still cucumbers , that had basically been fried , still retaining their cardboard-like flavor . nasty . ( good spicy ranch accompanying sauce though . ) the d cor of the restaurant is sooooo N . and la N , which is worse . pink red mood lighting , guys , really ? this isn ' t a gay bar . or virgin america . i totally appreciate all the care and research that went into this burger . but they would need to step up the seasoning a little for me to come back . 
i love all pizza . and although a little thin for me , still very tasty . i had the goat cheese special . it was fresh and salty , just how i like it . very upscale for a pizza place . . . 
great place for coffee and dessert ! we went there yesterday . i had espresso with hot cream and a cheesecake and my boyfriend had beer with sausages . everything was great ! i wanted to try other desserts too but decided that i ' ll do it next time place is little bit noisy and we had to wait in line for about N-N minutes . waitresses were really nice . location is great-all the museums around you . i highly recommend it . 
this is a must check out place ! the mussles are out of this world , along with the ceviche . the staff was warm and friendly they even served us right before they were closing . i would definitly recomend this place to everybody ! ! ! 
slow service but really good food - totally worth it . got the chicken korma and asked for it to be spicy - it was awesome ! ! ! ) . will def go back ! 
wow . . my first N star rated review ? ? to be honest , i sat here for a good N minutes deciding between a N or a N . reasons ? food service taste all N stars ! service - don ' t be turned off by the long line that wraps around the whole restaurant . they are extremely efficient in whatever system they are using . normally , the guy will go around taking all your orders as you stand in line . so by the time you get to the cash register , you ' re ready to go ! food taste yesterday was probably my Nrd or Nth time there and i am never disappointed . first three times i just couldn ' t stay away from the roast pork with sharp provolone and spinach greens yum . sandwich is something like N . N and each topping is N cents if i remember correctly . anyway the roast pork , um yum . that ' s all i can say . just had it yesterday , and writing about it makes me want to have it again ! the pork is just so gently roasted , has time to rest . . so it ' s just extremely juicy . the guy making your sandwiches pours even more juice on it prior to serving it to you . fabulous idea , guy mcgee ) the provolone just makes it that much more . . decadent if i can use that word for a simple sandwich shop . and the greens , are never dry just a nice delicious addition to an already perfect sandwich . yesterday , my best friend and i decided to try their italian pulled pork sandwich with our usual provolone spinach greens . again , delicious . my best friend said it ' s probably her favorite even beyond the initial roast pork . imo , it was great but i can ' t be too quick to judge yet . i think i ' ll have to have a roast pork soon . . just so i can compare . it had been months since the roast pork . omg yum . but same deal . when you bite into it , juices just flow . . it ' s a messy sandwich but they ' re nice and give you a fork . so we try to eat some of the meat and veggies off too make it smaller , so it can actually fit in our mouths haha . we also tried the sandwich with the horseradish they have on the bars , and it complimented the sandwich quite well . so why did i even consider giving it N stars ? well , the price . it ' s not a cheap sandwich ! it ' s about N dollars after all the toppings and whatnot . however , it ' s a nice big sandwich in my opinion . my best friend and i always have to split a sandwich , for us . . it ' s totally worth the N . N between the two of us ! it ' s sooo delicious . and honestly , i gave the N sandwich a N star rating because i don ' t want to penalize them for my broke butt . there is nothing wrong with them . . the taste is spot on , always . their service is always efficient and with such busy lines . . i never see a frown on their faces , still fast friendly and efficient . and omg their sandwiches . . . . so therefore , even though they ' re a bit steep for sandwiches , so worth it . please try it if you haven ' t before . like seriously . . . 
went on a sunday afternoon to grab some brunch with a couple of friends . we walked in and since this was our first time we awkwardly stood around for some help on seating . one waitress told us to go into the backyard and then another told us to wait to be seated . after awkwardly standing around , we eventually were seated in the backyard . the ambience was pretty cool and relaxed which i thought was worth the N stars . i ordered the gravy biscuits and my friend ordered the special of the day , apple pancakes . i could not finish my biscuits because it almost felt like it was doused in salt . i tried a bite of my friends apple pancakes in hopes of a better meal but was sadly disappointed . the pancakes tasted very dense and doughy with a couple of apples on top . however , the waitress that was serving us was very pleasant and kind which made up for some of the experience at j ' eatjet . 
best steak in new york . fish is awesome . staff super friendly . 
pork belly , tuna , cheese , steak , onions , classy , colorful , wine , delicious , amazing , gourmet , special , desserts , superb octopus , are you familiar with this words ? i am and casa mono is the place where you can say all this words and more without committing any mistake . wonderful , thank you ! a great experience . . . 
this place is all about the ambiance . while the place is pretty tight and packed , it makes up for it in the decor and mood . i went on a wednesday night around N pm and my friend and i luckily grabbed the last two seats at the bar . the bartender was super attentive ( and super cute ) and got us our drinks right away . our order - sangria - it seemed like a lot of people were ordering it . i thought it was pretty standard . - gambas al ajillo - this was definitely my favorite , and as another yelper said , the garlic olive oil is amazing . - lomo adobado - bread was good , but pork loin was on the dry side . still pretty good . - paquetitos de jamon - interesting texture and surprisingly very tasty - piquillos rellenos de ensaladilla rusa - i think i was the most disappointed with this one . it just felt like tuna salad . all in all i thoroughly enjoyed my time here and will definitely be back ! 
maybe N N stars to some , but i question if these individuals grew up eating vietnamese sandwiches . this place doesn ' t do banh mi justice . unless i am drunk and too lazy to go elsewhere , i would probably avoid this place . 
i ' m a local so this may be a bit biased , but i love this place and even more so now that they have outdoor seating in time for the summer . it ' s interesting to watch the crowd change as the day goes by , from the local work-time lunch crowd , to the happy hour after work crowd and onto the locals coming in to spend the rest of the night . try the duck parpadelle ! 
r . i . p . bistro . i have a feeling that high prices , and a lack of " target " customers in hightstown , coupled with the recession , did this place in . it really is a shame . the food was pretty good , and the staff and owner chef were all as sweet and kind as could be . i certainly hope that the rumor of them reopening at a new location is true . if i hear anything , i ' ll post it . 
i recently ate dinner for the second time at gtc and enjoyed it more than my first visit . both occasions have been dinner for two without reservations . our first visit we sat inside at a small table , we took one look at the wine list and opted for the wine store instead where we purchased a bottle for under N ( no cork fee for first bottle ) . our second visit was spur of the moment because the weather was so nice and we wanted to eat outdoors . the hostess did seem slightly annoyed that we did not have reservations but after a N minute wait ( not bad at all for a saturday evening ) we were seated at a large outdoor table with a sun umbrella . we ordered the chef ' s selection of cheeses . they are a great size for N-N people to share and come with accompaniments . for a main course we selected the saturday plate du jour of steak frites ( N and serves N ) . our waiter warned us that it was a sizable meal and boy was he correct , it filled a large skillet brought to our table . the steak was cooked correctly and the duck fat french fries were wonderful . the sauce on the bottom of the skillet made the meal even better . as our main course arrived the weather took a turn for the worst and it began to rain , luckily the umbrella caught most of it and we were able to continue to enjoy our meal . as a bonus , every other outdoor table quickly paid their bills and left , so it was very quiet outside ! tips make a reservation if you don ' t want to get an attitude from the hostess station . skip the wine list and byo or go to the wine store inside . get the duck fat fries ! 
i knew that it was a poor choice to come here for lunch before we walked in the door . i wanted to go to olives down the street and sit outside , but unfortunately my group thought otherwise . i felt the food would be overpriced , mediocre at best , and way overrated . it definitely lived up to my ( low ) expectations . the food was bland and unappetizing . the server was slow and had an attitude . the bill without tip was over N for N people at lunch . i want my money back ! the only positive i have to say is that they have a nice ( but overpriced ) beer selection , but you can easily get this at other better establishments close by . i will never come back here ! 
do yourself a favor and go to this restaurant while you are in nyc ! the food is outstanding . the drinks are soooo good . nyc best bartender xavier herit is one of the owners and knows exactly what it takes to run a great restaurant . he used to work at restaurant daniel which is arguably one of the best michelin star restaurants in the country . ch vre , oysters , scallops , pot de creme and a few masterfully crafted cocktails later and we were in heaven last friday night ! well done xavier and wallflower . all the best
truly comfortable authentic italian food , brick oven pizza unlike any others in the area for freshness and authenticity , a great meal every time , with personalized caring service . great value too ! 
always had it take out and never sat in . food was amazing ! ! ! 
i just passed by in walnut street and saw this place with a bunch of people getting inside and made me want to try . they have a really fantastic foods and i will be back . 
grrrrreat food ! ! everything i ' ve tried was amazing . a friend of mine took me to this ' temple ' as one of the reviewers worte d . i had the chalumi salad , which i had before somewhere else , but wasn ' t as good as this one . it had just the right amount of dressing and the divine grilled cheese was just the perfect addition ( too bad i don ' t live in the city . . . . i get craving from just by describing it ) . anyway , lets leave the salad aside for a second . i also had an artichoke blend hummus ( yes you can blend your hummus with different suggesting - so cool ! ) and it was so very tasty , warm and fresh . they bake their own pitot , imagine dipping the soft pita in a fresh hummus - should i say more ? besides their tasty food the place is well designed and you can tell they put a lot of thought into it especially all their tables and counter that are decorated with real ( i was told by the owner ) chick peas , it ' s insane if you are looking for an upgrade in what you already know about hummus and falafel , this is it - try it , i did and l will go back for more . 
i did enjoy my visit their with very nice people . a nice assortment of pastry . my only problem is the parking since their delivery trucks are parked in the front and can get difficult to park . overall , a good bakery . 
what a hidden jewel ! i was here with N other girls last night celebrating a birthday and i didn ' t have high expectations for this place for some reason . but the food blew me away . i thoroughly enjoyed my pork belly dish ( the pieces of duck i took off my friend ' s place haha ) and the chef sent out not N . . not N . . but five complimentary appetizers which were all delicious . loved the hamachi and whatever the " ball " shaped one in a green sauce was ( baby spanish octopus ? ) . excellent service as well and the ambiance was cozy and spacious . thanks ela ! 
excellent decor , atmosphere and vibe . deviled eggs awesome . ordered the crispy pig ear and skin salad . the crispy pig ears and skin was great but way , way too much salad dressing salty . i would order dressing on the side . they should serve crispy pig ears just as an appetizer with a balsamic vinegar dipping . also ordered the hamburger , medium rare , with fries . cheeseburger was cooked perfect , love roquefort but sandwich was salty . fries were the best . the ketchup they carry was vinegary ( sorry , use to heinz ) . overall , i would say food a bit over rated , too salty but great atmosphere . a must try at least one time . we went on a sunday night around N N , they said over an hour wait . went upstairs , got a seat at the bar , ordered a drink and half way into the drink was seated . not a bad wait . as far as being called the spotted pig . . . it looked like everyone ordered hamburger , which is beef . . . maybe they should have some kind of ground pork sandwich . 
visiting from atlanta , and loved this place ! i had the mad mountain ipa . . . was delish ! this place is a lot of fun , and close walk to everything fun in downtown area . 
yes the food here is good . yes they ' ve been serving the neighborhood longer then you and i have been around . and yes definitely they are expensiivveeee for ctown standards . sam bo fan which is N meat dish with rice is N . N , hello that is insane ! and it ' s not a big plate . honestly you can find better options in butcher shops that also serve chinese barbecue fare over rice for half the price . and it ' s bigger too . today i only eat here whenever i have friends visiting and since they can afford it they splurge . otherwise for the penny pinchers like me , you ' ve got way more cheaper options then here . 
the hostess told us N minute wait for a party of four . one hour later , we are finally seated - in the meantime , many parties of two had been seated , and my friend rightly pointed out that they could ' ve waited a bit and put two of those tables of two together for us . i know this is difficult to manage but i didn ' t think she was very creative . that said , the food was good , and the decor was good . . . i will prob not go back with a large party again . 
i went to walter ' s with two kids and their parents . the four of them had been there before and loved it each time . i must agree with them , everything about this place is fantastic . good selection ( and i ' m gluten and dairy sensitive ) of food and drinks . the drinks were excellently mixed and the food had such amazing flavors . all of the combinations worked well individually and when paired - such as the ceviche for an appetizer and the inside of the french dip with the phenomenal brussels sprouts . 
Nst and last time to joes . . . the hostess told us it would be an hour and N minutes for a table when we got there , which seemed odd because there were empty tables not being bussed and the staff appeared to be all hanging out by the server station . my suspicions were correct and we got our seat in about N minutes . that was the best part of the meal . our seat was way off in the corner of the bar area , and it smelled like old , stickey beer . it took our server N minutes before she even came over and acknowledged us . i watched her sing happy birthday , take a desert order , give a table their check and get them change before she took our drink and dinner order . we ordered king crab legs and sodas . our drinks came out fast and so did the melted butter for our crabs . we then sat there for N minutes with zero contact from any staff . our server must have had to run home to add the fabric softener , because she was nowhere to be found for the entire time . after N minutes of watching their lackluster and disorganized staff go through the motions , what appeared to be a manager approached our table with the food . i say " appeared " because this is the same guy who was standing at the server station chatting with his staff while customers were told it would be an hour and a half for a table while there were empty tables sitting for N to N minutes without being cleaned off and seated . he walked over like frankenstein and said this and only this " this is the old bay and this is the garlic " . the server came over and said that was her manager and she was very sorry for the wait . she confirmed our ticket had sat there for N minutes and finally she had to go " talk to someone in the back " . i can just imagine how that talk went . " wow it finally slowed down , it ' s almost empty out there . hey , what ' s that behind those boxes ? " well we got the crab legs , they were mediocre . she forgot the hush puppies , whatever . some people sat down next to us , ordered and had their food in N minutes while we ate our very fishy smelling crab legs . the quality of the crab seemed low , probably frozen . and the way it ' s prepared makes the shell bend instead of break . anyway , the two orders of crab legs and two sodas cost me N bucks . i could have done a lot more with that money . 
went on friday night and it was awesome . i actually was a bit of a hater on carmines before but this was really one of the best meals i ' ve ever had in my life . the waiter made the suggestion that an appetizer and a first plate could be shared and then for each of us ( was just me and a friend ) to order our own main plate . i appreciated him letting us know that the portions were done so that we didn ' t over order . we went with the insalata di bocconcini for appetizer and it was fantastic . . . fresh mozzerella , soprasatta , peppers , olives , etc . next up the fresh made ravioli stuffed with a puree of goat cheese and pears . unreal . i love cheese and fruit together , especially pears . this was the highlight of the meal for me . then pollo alla paesana . . . chicken on the bone , sausage , peppers and porcini mushrooms in a balsamic reduction sauce . i had this once before and it was really fantastic . no room for dessert . . . i wish i could have done it but i just ran out of room . fantastic meal , great place . word to the wise . . . we showed up at Npm and sat down immediately . for a place like this it ' s best to avoid the rush . . . i ' ll definitely recommend this place and will be going again . 
came for family dinner on thanksgiving ( grandparents are too old to cook and location not my preference ) . server grabbed my baked potato on my plate with bare hands and squeezed it , in some bizarre attempt to show me how to butter it . i asked her to please not touch my food , and had a new one brought out . there was no apology offered . i told her that i had to be honest and that it was completely inappropriate to touch the food on someone ' s plate . that aside , i had filet mignon , cooked unevenly and topped with a ridiculous garnish but no seasoning of any sort . family members had mashed potatoes which were clearly instant . place is stuffed so full of tables that servers can ' t get through to customers and are constantly reaching over you . not sure what other options are in the area , but they probably can beat this . 
i was at the restaurant the other night with clients , and we all just happened to be women . i was a little confounded by the extensive italian wine list given that i am ca wine devotee . the waiter kindly agreed to help me make a selection however , his suggestions primarily came from the wine by the glass wine list , and i was hoping to order something a little more special . the sommelier was making her rounds to almost all of the tables within view , and i expected she would stop by our table to offer her direction , too . no such luck . we apparently were not on her radar screen . otherwise dinner was delicious and the wait staff most accommodating . but the sommelier was mia . 
clean pleasant pub . been here for years . quiet not a rowdy place . great beer selection and the wings and steak sandwich are great . nice place to unwind after a stressful day . 
must say i was very disappointed in the service i received on sunday , N-N-N . and not to mention the food . i ordered an superman breakfast and the waitress brought it out with N strips of bacon on it when i request sauage . well , she grabbed a napkin and took the N strips of bacon off my plate , and walked awayk then came back with one , mind you one little piece of sauage . now come on , is this superman or what . i asked her , you only get one piece of saugage and she stated yea , that ' s it . we cut back . so i said the price didn ' t cut back so what ' s up with this one piece of meat . she said that ' s its . i vowed then never to come back again . the breakfast included an cheese omelte , potatoes and one dam piece of sauage for N . N . i ' ve never been so disappointed before in my life for a meal . i would have been better off just ordering eggs with cheese and potatoes . what the hell did i pay for . never again will i eat there
i really love cafeteria . it is open N hours and consistently serves really great food ! i always order the same thing . green eggs and ham and a house made jar of blackberry lemonade ! it is so good . steak and eggs is pretty good here too as it comes with a buttery biscuit and tender greens . brunch and late night crowds are expected . the prime time to go is early dinner or sunday brunch . there is usually a wait time , as the restaurant does not take reservations . the bartenders are all very kind and the atmosphere is warm with good eats ( like mac n cheese , and stacked pancakes , and something on the menu for everyone ) . it is a lively place indeed . the calamari is pretty good as well - deliciously deep-fried -- crispy on the outside and semi-chewy on the inside . and for you leg-loving squid fans , unfortunately , there were no tentacles to devour . but you surprisingly get long pieces of fried squid to dip into the steamy marinara and or tartar sauce . yummy tummy ! when your favorite brunch spot is swamped , i suggest " shashaying " to the cafeteria . it will not break your bank and you will leave full and happy . 
great beer selection , great snack menu . fun to grab drinks with friends , and also intimate enough for a date . staff is super nice , gives great suggestions . 
this is really good thai food . very random location in woodside , queens . if you go on a weekend for dinner , you will see a crowd of people outside waiting for a table . i went there last friday ( N N ) and had to wait N minutes for a table . . . worth the wait . we ordered the coconut curry soup which was amazing , the crispy pork ( a lil too salty for my taste ) and the drunk man noodles with beef . overall , i was happy with the food and will be going back again for more . they have a vast menu and i recommend anyone who is in queens looking for good thai food to check this place out . 
great italian ! it was my first time at carmines . the service was excellent and i was surprised by portions the food . i went with my coworkers and we didn ' t complain about the sizes of the entrees . the calamari as an appetizer and the penn al vodka is a must . 
good food . but the service was disappointing . i ordered spaghetti and meatballs . one of the meatballs was burned , and hard as a rock . i let the waiter know , and there was no apology , he just took the meatball away , and said sometimes they were fried on one side for too long . no replacement meatball was offered , and they still charged me for the burned meatball . very disappointing . 
i tried it the first time recently and i really liked it . service , ambiance etc were fine . i ordered guay tiew tom yum with papaya salad . very very good ! very flavorful and not too salty . 
the ramen is really good , but sometimes it ' s too salty . the hirata pork bun appetizer is good too . try to not come with a large party or else it ' s gonna be a long wait- it ' s always crowded and loud . 
such a s thole ! well , food is always good , but service sucks ! i ' ve been to the place bunch of times and i always leave frustrated and with the thought " never again " . oh , and i just found out that obnoxious idiot " host " is the owner of the place . so no change can be expected ! ! ! ! such a shame . . . 
the restaurant was highly recommended so friends and i finally went for dinner . i loved the decor , energy , the music . as soon as we entered , we were greeted by a lovely young lady , tatiana , who made the evening especially memorable . the food was flavorful and their selection of drinks and wines just complemented the whole meal . we will definitely be back soon . 
pancake was just perfect but they should use whole milk for there latte like any good italien coffee place
brunch - awesome . huge outdoor patio - awesome . free bbq - awesome . really friendly service and good food . have tried a few things off the menu and haven ' t had a bad meal . the cocktails are refreshing and not your run-of-the-mill recipes , and the beer and wine selection is good . it can get a little busy on sundays and summer weekends - have not tried it in the colder months ( yet . ) 
worth the wait - for two at N on a sunday , it was about N minutes . ( and as we know , good things happen to those who wait when it comes to brunch in nyc ) . the place is very cozy and very new york . i brought my own champagne and made mimosas there as a small table tucked into the corner so tight my little body could hardly squeeze into my seat . the outdoor seating is great on a sunny warm day and the street is very quiet and quaint , lined with N story brick homes and little shops not far down the block . potatoes were not as crispy as i would have liked , but that ' s a matter of opinion . eggs benedict was really good . got a macaron afterwords the size of a huge wooppie pie . absolutely worth ever penny and ever calorie . most of the pastries in their display looked equally as fantastic , including the almond croissant , so i say , go for it ! 
this is absolutely the best cheese steak ever . when friends visit from out of state , this is our first intro to philly
i always think this will be better than it is . i love wraps . i wish every sandwich came in wrap form . and that is kind of what this place looks like . they have a wrap for everything . but the end up tasting plain . perhaps i picked the wrong ones ? i had the buffalo chicken wrap - just chicken and blue cheese dressing . no crunch to it . totally could have used lettuce or something . i had a fiesta wrap too - the salsa was weird . i bet their turkey , tuna , etc wraps are fine but for N wrap , you can get those staples elsewhere . on the plus - they have a bar and the staff is friendly . they are super quick for take out . 
this company does have horrible customer service . i went there once to get a cookie . there was a really long line . when my turn came , the older man who was serving customers looked right at me , gave me a snide look , then asked the woman behind me if he could help her . she said to him , " i think she was in front of me " he gave me another snide look and then assisted me with my cookie . he then grabbed the paper took the cookie out of the glass container dropped it on the counter , and then told the younger woman who was in the middle of making a sandwich for another customer to cash me out . he did not bother to look at me again , but instead gave the nice lady behind me a huge smile and aks her how he could help her . i know im not crazy , and nethier did the nice lady behind me , beacause by the look she gave me i know we were thinking the same thing . it ' s not the N ' s anymore . 
staff was too busy arguing with each other to figure out where our order ticket had been ' misplaced ' . we waited N minutes for two orders of lo mein and an eggroll . i ' d rate the food but we never tasted any as we told them just to forget about it . we won ' t be back . 
very good organic food options . be prepared to wait for a table , but totally worth it . great banana bread and coffee too ! 
a nice subdued dark place , cozy divey , women feel safe here , nice neighborhood and close to the airport when picking up friends . had the taylor ham , eee-yum ! , on great italian type bread . benign " pros " at the bar , look like they came from central casting . only bummer is the counterfeit movie sellers that wander in off the street and cruise the tables for sales . but all in all , a great juke , a great place to visit with friends . 
never have an event here . i have come here a few times for brunch , so i thought an event here would be great . we were told we would have the front corner , upon our arrival they had people there eating , and they stayed there for an hour into our event . their selection of appetizers is minimal at best , and they were out of half of the items that would serve as finger foods for a standing party . the owner ignored us for most of the evening and didn ' t explain how the pricing would work to the clueless bartender and in the end they tried to not honor the pricing . he was very rude and dismissive during our conversations . we will never again enter this place . if you do decided to have an event , make sure you get everything in writing . 
this review encompasses N dining experiences , the first one during the first week of the official opening and the second one this past weekend . it was very interesting to see the differences in the service and the menu in just a short couple of months . the reason for N stars would be the service that we experienced in our most recent visit . all staff were incredibly attentive , aimed to please , and in short , knew their . service alone was N stars . the food was all good and solid . it appears that they have edited their menu quite a bit-- in this most recent visit , we started with a grilled cheese appetizer with butternut-apple soup and the smoked sturgeon carbonara . the grilled cheese was made differently this time , though no one at the table could quite put their finger on it . the soup served with the grilled cheese was previously tomato soup . . . . switch back to the tomato soup ! the butternut-squash apple soup was barely touched by our table ( which never happens ) . the carbonara was rich , buttery , all things that carbonara should be-- but barely any sturgeon ! for entrees , one friend said it was a delicious burger , and i have to say , those fries were crunchy and extremely salty ( good thing i love salt ) . i had the dry aged steak which was served with a buttery potato gratin . i specified medium but it came medium-rare still delicious though ! another friend had the arctic char , which she enjoyed but wished there was a sufficient side , as it came with N small fingerling potatoes . the desserts ! on the night that we came , they apparently debuted N new desserts , the warm chocolate cake and the other , i cannot remember . no matter , we tried everything . the warm chocolate cake , though i desperately wanted to love it , was very underwhelming and sadly the letdown of the desserts . the hazelnut financier cake with vanilla semifreddo and pomegranate consomme was amazing ! the beignets with vanilla custard and cranberry compote blew my mind away , and the apple crisp was perfect . the blood orange sorbet was a highlight of the ice cream and sorbets that we tried ( i did not like the beer ice cream , but that may just be personal preference ) . please bring back the molten chocolate tart ! i loved it last time ! all in all , it is a gorgeous setting and the service is wonderful . i definitely want to try more of the bar menu-- seems to be very solid , as many were ordering from it around us . be sure to get the dessert ! 
wow , how have i not reviewed uva yet ! ? sorry , uva ! i luhhhh you ! this is definitely my favorite spot among the ues wine bar scene . not only is their wine selection amazing ( nice beer cocktail list as well ) , but their food is delicious ( sometimes wine bars fall short on the food aspect , but not uva ) . i ' ve come here many times for brunch , dinner , and sometimes just a drink , and have never been disappointed by the quality or service . the ambiance is dark , cozy , and not too loud--great for dates as well as with family friends . so so so solid . 
because the restaurant itself is on the small side , there is always a wait during peak brunch time . if you hate waiting , i suggest you go to brunch at an off-peak time . that said , the service and food at northern spy are always excellent no matter how crowded it is . side note tip your server nicely . they really do work non-stop during brunch hours . i highly recommend the sake bloody mary , the buttery biscuits to start and the kale salad with eggs . the menu is a little on the pricey side , but it ' s worth it if you are looking for something beyond the usual coffee , bacon and eggs . 
this place is strictly set-up as a " date place " . the ambiance is dim with candles on all the tables . the table are extremely small . there is music playing . the waitresses are dressed to impress . the food was very good . we both ordered falafel platters and grape leaves as an appetizer . the grape leaves were from a can and i wouldn ' t get them again but the main courses ruled . i wish that more places including this one were less romantic looking and more man friendly . it seems to be the trend lately . we are just two beer buzzed dudes who wanted to eat something good but were not out on a date . just sayin . 
in my attempt to try to find wholesome asian food i can across clifton thai . i have yet to dine in but every time i come by to pick up or even order delivery , staff has been nothing short of courteous and polite . personally i like curry and have tried both the red curry noodles and green curry noodles . both of which are great and you pick between meat selections of chicken , beef , squid or shrimp . i ' ve also had the drunken noodles which are awesome and hit the spot if you ' re especially hungry . the portions are generous and you ' re definitely getting your monies worth . jungle chicken wing appetizer is tasty and great by itself if you ' re a big fan of wings i love the chicken dumplings . delivery is exceptionally fast , usually within N mins you ' ll had someone at your door . 
the price is no reflection of the quality of the food . excellent fried rice and noodles . just stay away from wontons and dumplings . the skin is too thick . nothing like the authentic dumplings you ' d taste in asia . but when i crave noodles or rice dishes , this is the place to be . 
the empanadas were unlike anything i ' ve had before , very savory and filling . be sure to get the side sauces too , so many to choose from ! 
awful service ! we used to order from this place frequently and had recently noticed a down turn in service . recently , a group of people from the office placed an order and they forgot a sandwich . after calling back once and promising to bring the sandwich , it never showed . after call N , they tried to tell us that they gave us the sandwich . after N minutes of arguing that the sandwich was in the bag , the owner finally agrees to bring the sandwich over . nothing like being made out to be a criminal instead of a customer . they have lost the business of our entire N person operation . 
a few friends and i arrived a little late for our brunch reservation on nyd but were seated at an open table within N minutes . the restaurant is cramped and tiny but clean and trendy-looking . our table was right in front of the entrance , which proved to be chilly for a couple of my friends , as there is only a curtain ( usually open for sunlight ) to separate the front entrance from our table the rest of the restaurant . and because of our seating arrangement , i was unable to observe the rest of the restaurant interior , which seemed long and narrow and included a bar . anyways , food ! our table ordered a variety of individual meals from the brunch menu mango-stuffed french toast with caramelized macapuno fresh fruit , eggs benigno ( lola mahal ' s homestyle pandesal , two poached farm eggs , thinly sliced fresh spam , kalamansi hollandaise , kamote home fries , and maliit salad w coconut-sugarcane vinegar dressing ) , and filipino pride chicken ' n ' ube waffle ( flourless filipino-style fried chicken , ube " prince-worthy " purple waffle , macapuno jam , anchovy bagoong garlic chive compound butter ) . i took a small bite out of everyone ' s dish and thoroughly enjoyed each one . the french toast and chicken ' n ' ube waffles were my favorite . the mango in the french toast tasted more peachy than mangoey , but the dish was otherwise perfect and delicious ( not too sweet or eggy like some french toast out there ) . the chicken ' n ' ube waffles were also perfect and tasty . ( i ' m not the biggest fan of ube , but i would order this dish ( or the french toast ) next time . maybe my palate ' s changing ? ) the eggs benigno were also tasty but not my favorite dish , as i don ' t like poached eggs topped with hollandaise ( and cheese ? i definitely tasted cheese over those eggs . ) . i wish the spam pieces weren ' t sliced as thinly because more spam would ' ve balanced out the poached egg hollandaise taste . the home fries were perfect with the banana ketchup ( and not over-salted ) . i did not taste the salad , but it looked really fresh . i ordered the ilog breakfast silog ( sinangag ( garlic rice ) itlog ( egg ) served with relish ( of kamatis , pepino , sibuyas and wansoy with patis dressing choice ) and tocilog ( homemade tocino , a N-up cured pork ) . i enjoyed my dish a lot , minus the pork and the egg . the pork was a bit overcooked , dry , and fatty . i did not care too much for the N-up marination either , which added a hint of sweetness and might ' ve been responsible for the dryness of the meat . ( i ' m not N sure . ) the egg , on the other hand , was fine but slightly undercooked for my taste . i would order my dish again , though , solely for the rice , which was perfectly flavored and cooked ! i was worried the rice would be drenched in some sort of sauce , but the rice was instead infused with garlic ( and moist ) . i would , however , order a different meat ( probably the longsilog ( longganisa , sweet , garlicky pork sausage ) ) . as we were paying leaving , the chef must ' ve burnt something terribly in the back . spicy smoke suddenly engulfed the restaurant , causing everyone to cough a lot . luckily we were leaving , but i felt bad for the other diners . nevertheless , i will be back at this restaurant for both the great food and service ( although they automatically add on gratuity for groups of N or more ) . 
the food is great , what a place for lunch with my child . they are so nice to our friend ' s children and ours that we will definitely be back for more lunch dates there . i love the onion spooup
it seems this spot is probably a better choice for dinner - my friend and i had brunch here and just thought it was ok and nothing that stood out as amazing . the brunch menu is rather limited , and what we did end up getting lacked taste . the enchiladas were bland , as was everything else . on a more positive note , the cocktails are very reasonably priced , and are by no means weak . the bloody mary was good , but could have used more heat . 
the food is a great , do the service was not , the waitress was concentrated in what was going on in the bar . not good for a first date to loud and very crowded
great midtown theatre district italian food in a romantic and cozy atmosphere . prices are fair , food was excellent and service was perfect ! 
miriam and i came here for lunchie a few days ago . both of us had afternoon meetings that ran over so by the time we made our way down Nth avenue about Npm , we were really hungry . walking through the doors of woorijip i think my jaw hit the floor . N words korean . lunch . buffet . i think ( know ) i shoved miriam outta my way in my haste to get to the front of the line . not that i could identify most of what was there , but i was scooping it up left and right onto my plate . word to the wise the cold dishes are in the front , so if you are a piggy like me , scoop wisely or you won ' t have much room for the hot stuff at the end ( but don ' t worry , i made room ) . kimchi rice , bulgogi , spicy squid . i was shaking with anticipation ! N later we were at a table and silently shoveling food into our mouths as we gazed around in wonder . the walls are lined with refrigerated cases that hold containers of soups , rices , meats , whole meals , that can be reheated at home or the microwave in the back . there is also a hot case near the cashier that offers a boxed selection meal deal for around N . miriam actually got a few to take home for her dinner that night ( now who ' s the piggy ? ) will i be back ? hell yes ! i ' m just going to have to try and control how often i go . 
i went there with my wife and we were so excited with the whole decoration of the restaurant . . . the staff was very nice and polite . the food even if the portion of it was small ( tapas ) , it was tastefull . i would recommended it for sure ! ! ! 
frankly some of the best food we have had . the quality food and taste that we experienced seemingly would have been in the N- N entree when the actual price is N- N entree . hope this helps and i hope that you have a similar experience ! 
i like this place . clean and the staff is cute . 
best ramen in nyc , hands down . only negative is the long wait time to get a table . best time to go is during lunch or go solo for dinner when they can fit you into the bar area . hopefully their new location will ease the crowds a bit but it ' s def . worth the wait . 
eat here all the time . . . . love this place
this place is just awesome ! ! the owners are great people , the food is out of this world , and the atmosphere is great . the fries are fresh cut and the burgers are fantastic . i have tried almost everything on the menu and there daily specials are amazing . my family and i go here for dinner or lunch at least once a week . highly recommend this to anyone . personally i am not a fish guy but from what my wife says it is better than argyle . 
ever since i was a lil chinaboy , my parent took me here to eat . it was all we could afford since we were illegal immigrant and had no moneys . but now i am us citizen and i have job , i still go eat he ah ! this is favorite " fast food " chineses restaurant . the food good and cheap . waitas quick and get you food and check quick , even fasta than mcdonalds sometimes . the place look lil dirty but i neva got sick or food poison yet . when i grow up , i open my own restaurant like this and call it big rod . everybody eat big rod . ok ? 
the falafel was excellent , but the sides were greasy . admittedly , i had a double-serving of fried eggplant because they were out of the other sides . a great choice for kosher take-out . 
here ' s a tapas bar where you can ' t complain about getting stuck with a seat at the bar . this place gets pretty busy and the staff certainly knows how to handle the high volume of loyal patrons . great date spot and vivacious atmosphere- tons of positive energy going around . we were seated in the back at the bar facing the ovens and grill . quite an experience to watch the line cooks doing nothing but focused on dish aesthetic and presentation . i had sobrasada ( soft pork sausage withe pimenton , eggs , beans ) and pan-seared tuna with flakes of ham ( forgetting the name and now it s not on their menu ) . finished it off with a N d . ventura burato mencia wine . 
coming here without a reservation was not our brightest idea but luckily maharlika allows you to order the full menu at the bar . best of all , you get wonderful service . the bartender was so attentive and tended to our every needs . for our party of N , we did a family style of N appetizers and N entrees . it was the perfect amount because we were stuffed and went to get ice cream afterwards for dessert . i cant remember the exact names on the menu but for the appetizers , we ordered the cigar rolls - a super long and thin spring roll and the fried spam . i would have never thought that fried spam would taste good but it was amaze-balls ! ! the frying took away the saltiness of the spam and you ' re left with the great flavor . so glad we ordered it . our entrees included their famous chicken and ube waffle , beef short ribs and pork spare ribs . that ube waffle was out of this world . it had the perfect amount of sweetness and the crunch added the finishing touch . the chicken was also cooked to perfection- so tender and juicy . the meat dishes were great too but i was so obsessed with the chicken . great place to come on a week night . although a bit small , their flavors make up for it in a big way . just call to make a reservation if you don ' t want to sit at the bar . 
food was delicious , i ordered a bacon cheeseburger with steak fries and a john daily ! no other complaint besides the wait , but definitely worth it ! 
i can say best haleem i had in the east coast-- hi all , i know all who came from south india would miss the hyderabadi haleem . after moving from central to east coast , i tried haleem and couldn ' t find better haleem than the one ' s you get in chicago out here in us . but , after eating haleem out here i would definitely say this is the best place to get hyderabadi haleem in east coast or at least in twin states ny nj . if you are in city i would for sure recommend you this place to try out . 
really great service and food . the prices aren ' t bad . nice place to go for lunch with friends . been going there for years and never had any complains . very nice people and speedy service . 
i absolutely loved the food . i couldn ' t decide what to get so a couple of friends and i split a bunch of stuff . the deviled eggs were deliciously flavorful and creamy , not a big fan of potato salad but really liked it here , pickled green beans had a nice kick , pork belly was the right combination of crispy and tender , the burger and brisket-duck liver boudin balls just melted in my mouth , hot sausage was really tasty and just loved the crawfish mac cheese . there was a good amount of crawfish morsels , very tender and not rubbery . a very warm buttermilk biscuit that hits the spot . we sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly and helpful bartender . even got to meet simon and was able to tell him how happy he made my taste buds . all in all pretty great . i don ' t even live in bushwick and will be back for more , 
this is one of my co-worker ' s favorite lunch spot therefore i was introduced by her . you can ' t even tell there is a restaurant unless someone has pointed it out to you . however , i have been here several times for lunch . the food is decent and it can get expensive depending on what you order . i usually order the sasmhi platter that runs N . the deserts are amazing . i love the cold soba noodles that is part of my platter . tip call for a reservation . 
came here for brunch . . . i ordered steak and egg . . . and friend ordered a pizza . . . have to say . . . it was definitely on a saltier side . . . . i previously came here for dinner . . . . but i don ' t remembered being this salty . . . oh yeah . . . it ' s no longer byob . . . boo . . . 
arrived excited to have our first venezuelan meal ever . after N minutes , we could not wait to leave . horrible service ! arrogant . obnoxious . uncaring . that ' s got to be going into the food . and yes , it is scorching ' hot pockets ' , dry rice and overcooked tasteless plantain sandwich that was a cardiac arrest in a paper wrapping . ugh and have you noticed the review here by desiree ? it has to be written by someone who works there ! read the tone and the nastiness of the reviewer ? the stuff about customers having a fat ass , needing to hit the gym , or waiters not being your slaves ? that energy in the writing is exactly the energy that you feel when you eat there . 
this is the typical case of where the hype totally ruined a good experience . i went expecting the best ! people compared it to the best ! i had the classic roast pork with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe . where to start . . . the bread . yes . lets start with the bread . it ' s dry , hard and i think i cut my gums . thumbs down . the pork . . . it ' s okay . a little on the dry side . wish i had more au jus or something . broccoli rabe - the only highlight of this hoagie . it was seasoned well , cooked well . . . it was just delicious . but why the N stars ? the veggie out shined the meat . hence . . . low score . i will give an extra half star to our server . she was super nice . i think i would have given this place a three if i wasn ' t expecting anything . 
besides the ' fried ' smoke , everything else is just wonderful . delicious tapas served with a smile . go for the tuna , and fall in love w the lamb ! and always , always try the jamon . . . yes , i will be back art gallery first and some tapas later . . . 
stay far away ! the first time my office heard about this place was when a co worker got food poisoning and called in sick for three days after having a lobster roll at the brooklyn flea one sunday . we chalked it up to chance and decided to still be brave and try the acclaimed lobster roll one day from the lobster food truck . well what a mistake . when we arrived this week all we saw in the trucks " serving window " was a fat guy with his ass crack staring straight in our faces . when we tried to get his attention he seemed to busy talking to his dude co workers and jumped off the counter rolling his eyes at us as if we had bothered him so much . they then informed us that the grill was still heating up and they could have food for us in five minutes if we paid them the N right away . we did and the dude grabbed our money not even saying thank you- and went right back into his conversation about " last weeks pussy " and complaining about his " crazy bitch boss " with the other workers . after a bit the rolls were ready and he practically threw them at us without saying thank you . back in our office we unwrapped our tiny portions of lobster on a toasted hot dog bun and were less than impressed . not only was the flavor lacking but my lobster roll had a piece of short brown hair topping it ! ! ! after nearly vomiting up what i had eaten we have all decided never to step food near red hook lobster truck or pound again . 
bad food . pleasant service . i ' m always impressed how restaurants with bad food stay in business . " good on ' em " as my kiwi friends would say . three appetizers from their daily special , two dinner main dishes , and two deserts i have to say only the mango in the desert was nice . again , good service . 
great restaurant . went there on a regular weekend the first time and liked it a lot . went again for new year ' s and liked it even more . the food is creative and very tasty . hard to make reservations . i guess the word is out . 
i had a work dinner here and it was good but a bit inconsistent . we shared a few of the appetizers and the lamb sliders were the star of the evening . i had a braised beef shoulder which was good , but not super memorable . i also tried some of hte lamb shank and it was had a lot of flavor and was super tender , but it seemed to have too many ingredients competing against each other . it was inconsistent because a couple of people ordered the catfish and it was gigantic and overly breaded . it kind of reminded me of something you might get at cheesecake factory . 
i ' ve been here N times , each time hoping the service would be better . it wasn ' t . the first time i came with my fianc for dinner . holy slow . took about N . N hours and we only ordered a cocktail and an entree each . they took our menus away before we even ordered , somebody came back about N minutes later to basically ask what we were doing there -obviously they forgot that had seated us and that we needed to order food , the wait for the food to come out was also ridiculously long , and we had to ask N times to get the cocktails we ordered . the worst part was that it is a small restaurant and you can see the waitstaff . the entire time our waitress was just at the bar texting and talking to someone else that worked there . the second time i came back with a friend for brunch , hoping that the slow service the first time was just an anomaly . it was not . i was feeling okay about coming back because the brunch deal is actually super good for the price and includes a drink , entree , and coffee tea ( but is cash only , which they only tell you after you ' ve been seated ) . the lamb burger was actually delicious , the flatbread was meh . i really do like the cocktails , but it took us about N minutes once our glasses were empty to try to flag her down to get a refill , and then another N minutes to get the glasses filled . i would ' ve had a third but having to try to wave down the waitress for N minutes to get another one didn ' t seem worth it . they forgot to give us ( or even ask if we wanted ) the coffee tea , and once again did not want to bother trying to get the waitress ' attention . the third ( and last ) time i came in , i came in with a friend to grab a quick cocktail . we asked for a drink menu at the bar and they handed us the menu , we looked and saw the cocktails were N each so we thought luck was in our favor . it was not . again . we got a drink each and handed the bartender a N , who then looked at us like we were aliens for waiting there , and dismissively said " okay , you can go " . we asked about the prices on the menu and he said well that price is for brunch only . while it ' s totally understandable that they have brunch pricing on drinks , but that doesn ' t change the fact that they gave us a menu with different prices on it and didn ' t say anything until after we got our drinks . i really wanted to like this place because it ' s so close to where i live , but it ' s definitely not good enough to deal with the bad wait staff and the slow service . 
had the jerk chicken . . . not the best but with these late night hours , who cares ! don ' t forget your drink with this meal . hot hot hot . food N stars having something to eat other than gross pizza grinders at Nam N stars . 
the food here is pretty good and better than most others in the local area . i order delivery from here occasionally and they seem to be pretty good about it . i ' ve been inside at one time and saw that it was clean and the atmosphere was really nice . when i went in i even saw that they had a sushi bar . quality wise food is really good , price on the other hand is a bit higher than what one would typically expect . overall i do recommend it to others to try . 
good mex and other good stuff that makes you happy in your belly . 
was in town for nyc for a night and stayed at the yotel . this place is a block away and was delish ! order appetizers- the pepper thing ( don ' t remember the exact name ) is the best thing on the menu . empanadas are delicious too . dinner- order the roasted chicken . it ' s a lot of food . order a few things and share with the table . and the sangria is great ! it does sneak up on you though ) 
what can i say that hasn ' t already been said by my fellow yelp brethren time and time again ? not much . this place is quality , a great place to eat lunch for anyone that works nearby . this isn ' t your typical indian curry , so you can eat it for lunch without smelling like curry for the rest of the day . the chicken was moist on the inside , and perfectly crispy on the outside . i got the double ( l ) and it was a little too much food . since there ' s a hefty portion of rice , you can fill up quickly . next time , i ' ll be going with the single and a few sides this time . i will , without a doubt , return again in the near future . 
great great corn , cuban food
this is by far the best place to eat fish in the city . exact replica of the astoria gem . you cant go wrong . top quality . 
nicely located and great atomosphere as always . i enjoyed deserts and main course meals often . the non-veg is really tasty with toppings and garnishes . i love the food and service of staff . shall keep on going as always . 
a nice twist on traditional thai . had a simple salad and the chicken with N kinds of nuts . nice selection of moderately priced wines . definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood . 
my friend sniped a last minute reservation and here we are at bobby flay ' s restaurant . decor was rustic with exposed brick and felt extremely homely . the waitress helped us get a table to fit in a Nrd friend , even though we had a reservation for N , so thanks so much for accomodating ! ( there were very few of these tables where this was possible . ) on to the food ! started with a bottle of wine , a big red from spain , but took a while to get there . ordered two of the N-plated apps ( egg plant , lamb , artichoke ) then ( eleven layered potato , chorizo , burrata ) of the N , my personal N top choices are the eleven layered potato and the artichoke . each has a very distinct flavor and texture that even now i can remember , N days later . highly recommended and expertly cooked flavored , perfectly crispy on the sides and light to the tongue but explosive in flavor . then we hit up the carb with a crab risotto ( generous in crab , tastes fresh ) and the paella ( kale and artichoke and egg . . . but no one here mentioned the delicious crispy rice ! ) finished up with a dessert , but don ' t remember what it is - we were so full . enjoy ! 
highly impressed with beyond sushi . delicious , healthy , beautiful store design , friendly atmosphere no wonder they got a big fat " a " on their window . can ' t wait to introduce beyond sushi to my office next week ! 
official spot , run by official people . these guys are on to something . also two thumbs up for pioneering a neighborhood . 
this place is amazing ! the food was fabulous , the service fantastic , and best of all they treat you like on old friend dropping by for dinner . i felt like i was with family enjoying great food and company . it made my N days of work seem like a vacation . 
wow . i love the margaretta pizza ! , thin crust crunchy , full of flavor its amazing but it doesn ' t end there . the past dishes are amazing , and the best thing about it is you can order specials and they will make it for you . the fish specials and the baked clams are full of flavor and so fresh . when i walked into this place i was expecting a pizzeria what i got was a full on italian gourmet restaurant . . . its very cute and family oriented . the pizza is amazing , original margareta is the best , and if you want something different i suggest you should try the arugula pizza ! the pasta is fantastic . the sandwiches are amazing , esp the grilled chicken fresh mozzarella roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar . . mouth watering ! the appetizers are amazing . try the baked clams or the bruschetta i am without question and beyond doubt a fan for life ! ! 
what a wonderful place ! hubby made reservations here for my birthday and i didn ' t think we ' d be able to keep them because it was the day of the hurricane . lucky for us , irene ended up being kind of wimpy and la sirene was open for business ! we began our meal with the goat cheese tart which was very rich and tasty . hubby got the tournedos rossini ( seared filet mignon over bread with foie gras ( pate style ) shallots , port red wine truffle sauce ) . this thing was just as decadent as it sounds . the meat was high quality and the foie gras was the best i ' ve ever tried . i oped for the kassulet touloussain de la maison ( cannellini beans , tomato , garlic duck confit , slab bacon pork sausage all braised with duck fat ) ! delicious but very , very heavy . it was a wonderful night with impeccable service , cozy atmosphere , and terrific meal ! we just got back from paris and we both agreed that la sirene ' s food was even better than the much more expensive meals we had in paris . nyc really does just have the best food . highly recommend ! 
every time i visited this place it was a nice experience , every paninni i tried was delicious . the price is very affordable and the rear patio is very relaxing for enjoy a glass of wine , staff are very helpful and educated . il bambino is a successful business and they really deserve it . . 
oh yes this is the best ! the portions are reasonable , not tiny not huge which work for me . lovely light and decor , N in customer service . i don ' t find it overly expensive neither . highly recommended
i wasn ' t expecting much in the times square area since most places are over-priced tourist traps , however , i was pleasantly surprised at tony ' s di napoli . took my mom for dinner and a show , so since it was just two of us , we decided to share a dish ( they serve family-style portions . ) we ordered the black pasta with seafood and boy-oh-boy was it good ! the pasta was very flavorful and nicely seasoned . i also got a frozen drink -- forgot which one -- but it was also very good . for dessert , we ordered and split a " very berry " which was layers of berries and cannoli cream . it was a nice and light finish to our meal . a plus , was that since we were going to see phantom after , i was worried that our leftovers ( we had a lot ) would be awkward to carry into the theatre . our waiter labeled our bag and held it for us in the fridge till we got out of the show ! so glad we did that because it was awesome to heat up the leftovers the next day and share it with my hubby ) 
i knew brazilian food had to be more thank meat on a sword and a caparinha . super amazing sit down traditional food . this place is an amazing addition to the already super-diverse neighborhood . 
i loved this place ! might just be my new favorite restaurant in philly . the food , the service , the ambiance -- all quaint , simple , and perfect . i read some reviews about poor service but that wasn ' t my experience at all . the waiter was extremely helpful and thorough -- and we were a tough crowd with lots of questions . for an appetizer , we all ordered the dips , which included , among other things , the best babaganoush i ' ve ever had . for an entree , i ordered the stuffed vegetables which was stuffed cabbage with lentils , rice , and feta . it was amazing ! my fiance got the veal dish and also loved . our two other dining companions ordered the rabbit and the special of the day - a pork dish - and they were as equally impressed as us . for dessert , we got the homemade ice cream - halavah and mint flavored . delicious ! the chef was making rounds during dinner and we had a chance to tell him what an amazing dinner we enjoyed . i will definitely be back -- very excited to try their brunch ! 
the service and ambiance were very nice and the food was delicious ! i came with N other friends and we had the ahi tuna tartare , lobster mac n cheese , chicken skewers and shrimp tacos . they were all amazing ! definitely coming back . 
this is the best vegan breakfast establishment i ' ve ever been to . often , these places try too hard but champs nails it . the ingredients are very fresh and the portions are appropriate and not super-sized . the coffee is pretty delicious , which is a deal breaker . the staff are all very sweet and attentive . i ' ve also never had to wait for a table , but i do go on the earlier side . the decor is kitschy but not contrived . there is a saved by the bell board game on the counter . no , i get to be kelly kapowski this time . the menu advertises several comfort food type breakfast items such as french toast which often leaves you feeling like there is a brick in your stomach but champs ' version is light and fluffy . there is definitely something for everyone on the menu and i have a tough time choosing . as much as i want to re-order my favorites , i am confident that every item will be enjoyable . the french toast slam was my latest choice and everything was outstanding . faux meat items tend to be hit or miss but their soysage and tempeh bacon were forces to be reckoned with . the tofu scramble portion of this entree ? not completely littered with onions like N of restaurants who choose to serve tofu scrambles . on another visit , i ' ve enjoyed the awesome bowl , and while it was delicious , i feel that the garlic rosemary potatoes made it a touch too heavy . the quinoa , peppers , greens and tofu scramble would have sufficed for me . the dish that won my heart was the buffalo ranch salad . its ingredients are exactly what you expect and hope for . you will not be disappointed . this is for sure on the spicier side so proceed with caution . the prices are reasonable considering the percentage of organics they use . there is no alcohol to drive up the bill , so that is also helpful for the brunch cocktail lovers like myself . cash only . atm inside . go here . 
thousand layer bread potato curry spicy and yummy ! i had the cold burmese noodles and hubs ordered the pineapple fish - great meals both ! the prices are reasonable , the staff was very friendly and attentive and the decor was tasteful without going overboard . i ' d also recommend the coconut juice ) 
i went to a small get together at a friend ' s house about a month ago and upon entering the house i was greeted with the most glorious smells and some truly tasty hors d ' oeuvres . i asked my friend who had made the food and i was introduced to a really nice guy who mentioned that he worked in the kitchen at a french mediterranean cafe in northern liberties a bit north of honey ' s on Nth . i ' d never heard of cafe la maude before this , and his decision to describe the cafe by location rather than by name was a good one , because on a stroll home down Nth street this past sunday i found myself walking by the cafe and remembering the wonderful hors d ' oeuvres i had just a few weeks prior . the cafe has a wonderful atmosphere with a large window that opens up out onto the street and all the charm of a true french cafe . the food here is really unique and really delicious . i shared the foul moudamas platter and a halloumi press sandwich with a friend and both were out of this world . the hummus on the foul moudamas platter was spicy , garlic-y and delicious and had that texture you only get from the real home-made stuff . the sandwich was almost meaty in texture with the thick slices of grilled halloumi with a great fresh peppery flavor from the musculan greens , arugula aioli . as reviewer ettya f . mentions the food has " the perfect confluence of french , mediterranean , turkish and portugese " influence . and it really does . i think the next time i ' m in the area i may very well pass up brunch at honey ' s for this hidden gem just down the block . 
what happened to my other review ? i wrote one after a previous visit because it was so good . . . this place serves good portions of great food . i was so pleasantly surprised to find this place , nearby a client ' s office , that i always go back . favorites include the creamed spinach ( although the collards are great too ) , the crab salad ( you could make a full meal of this ) and the barbeque chicken . now , i usually don ' t like barbeque , but i do like this one . in fact , this is the only place i order barbeque . they also have good entertainment , and events so there are always people at the bar . it has a good , comfortable atmosphere too . definitely a highly recommend ! 
five stars - hard to give it any less . pro - food - it ' s divine con - the wait pro - i live upstairs con - i had to see stylish people while wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt pro - knowing all those people are jealous because i can go back to my cozy warm apt , while they have to wait outside in the cold . yep , the pros outweigh the cons . def a must-eat when on the les
i don ' t know why people line up to get into this place , i stopped eons ago because of one bad experience after another , but today was my friend ' s birthday and that ' s where she wanted to go . first off i requested milk instead of cream from the waitress and had to ask N times , and she kept saying with a bit of saltiness , " yes , i ' m getting it " . but she wasn ' t overtly rude , so ok , i was trying to remain open-minded . i asked for my breakfast burrito without meat and it came with meat - who knows where communication broke down , but i ' m not a vegetarian so i decided to go with it . it was a giant burrito with a kind of unappealing blob of creamy sauce on top . but looks aren ' t everything , however it didn ' t taste all that great ( the vegetables were nice but the egg part . . . of an omelet . . . was completely blah ) and the potatoes on the side with it were really bland , so i was not enjoying the meal much and then i saw a hair . nuff said . the waitress did not ask why i hadn ' t eaten most of my food , which seems like waitressing N stuff , but perhaps they ' re used to people being disappointed . two of my other friends claim that every time they ' ve gone there at least one person has gotten a plate with something wrong - not what they ordered , not very tasty , etc . plus sabrina ' s staff are famous among my friends and i throughout the history of the restaurant for being rude and fairly unconcerned about their patrons ' complaints . i keep thinking that must be luck of the draw , but apparently bad attitude can rub off and become traditional at a restaurant , especially when rewarded with a non-stop flow of patrons who for some unknown reason think sabrina ' s is the be-all end-all . so to recap incorrect orders , bland uninspired food , a hair and bad service . and guess what , it ' s a few hours later and i ' ve felt nauseous ever since breakfast . 
coffee N service N decor N great little japanese cafe . counter service . nice and relaxing atmosphere with a steady flow of patrons . very friendly staff and good selection of omusubi ( aka onigiri ) . also , very reasonably priced lunch combos leave you feeling satisfied and and " light " - not uncomfortably full . the desserts are a nice change of pace as well . japanese green tea chiffon cake , green tea or black sesame cookies , etc . the only thing that could make this cafe better would be to have organic options . 
i have been to eulogy several times and my most recent visit left me disappointed . the beer menu is extensive but that is about the only perk to this place . we sat upstairs . our server was not all that attentive and made it known that there was no bartender on the second floor and she would have to run up and down the steps for our drinks . i ordered the mussels with red sauce and was disappointed especially since this place is supposed to be known for their mussels . the red sauce didn ' t have much flavor and was rather blah . the bread that was served with it was terrible . i ' m used to crunchy bread to go with mussels . this bread was spongy and did not taste fresh . it tasted like it sat in a plastic bag on a counter for a couple days . the fries were an extra N and unimpressive , so unimpressive that they shouldn ' t be charging for the fries or the very average sauce that comes with the fries . for mussels , eulogy doesn ' t even come close to monks , belgium cafe or royal tavern . the bathroom on the second floor is also super warm- i am guessing because it is above the kitchen . 
i had a great meal here . the place is very friendly . i highly recomend it to anyone looking to eat
food was great . great middle eastern flavors . the waitress was very helpful in choosing a wine that suited my preferences . scoutmob does it again . but i would pay full price to eat here . 
this is my favorite restaurant in the area . they make the most delicious crepes . the salads are also very good . i love the ambience ( very french ) and the wait staff is decent . i think is would be a perfect restaurant for a first date , especially if he she likes french food . 
chicken ceasar salad hummus plate with vegetables . it ' s a decent meal , comes quick and they don ' t leave you hanging . 
this is defiantly worth visiting if you are in the area , although not sure i would travel across town to eat here . i had one great N star dish , and the rest were N stars , maybe a N star in the mix . 
like gus c . they need more customer skills , but its getting better the more times i go in . the waiting time is average ! the place is kept clean . ) 
the place is very small and the tables are squeezed against one another . the tables themselves are so tiny that we couldn ' t fit all our plates there ( we were just N ) , we had to use the table beside to move there part of the stuff ( luckily it wasn ' t occcupied ) . the restroom is almost as tiny in a plane ) ) ) i don ' t think a person in a wheelchair can fit there . the food was not great , but ok . servers were nice though . the atmosphere is nice too . i think it ' s worth to drop by there if you ' re in the area , but it ' s not worth coming down there for the place itself . 
found this on yelp and decided to try while in town . had a late lunch and the place was still quite busy . friends had pad thai and i had basil chicken with green beans . i ordered it medium spicy . the waitress looked at me and suggested mild spicy . she was correct in this case . it was a little more heat than i am used too but had great flavor . i didn ' t care that the chicken was chopped but not my preference . the curry puffs were good too . 
very cute place . the food was pretty awesome but the service was slow slow slow . the group of people next to us even got up and left because they sat down and were not greeted for N minutes . still a great place to go with great food and great atmosphere , just do not go when you ' re in a hurry ! you might want to bring more than one bottle of wine and stay for a while . 
great ole english tavern ! 
i am obsessed with this place ! i eat here or get delivery from them twice a week . try the fish taco , surf n turf , and the little meats . man the little meats is so amazing . they do it right . everyone who works here is so friendly and happy . i will be back again and again . 
well i ' ve actually been there several more times , and i am happy to update my review to N stars . this is absolutely my favorite restaurant now . things i love the burgers are amazing , the bourbon selection and mixed drinks are great ( had a mint julep for the derby this weekend ! ) , the " american nachos " appetizer , still adore the truffle fries , the horseradish salmon . . . . i could go on and on . the service has always been good as well . and they have a gluten free menu ! it features items from their menu that are inherently gluten-free plus variations you can order like chicken tenders with gluten-free batter or a gluten-free bun for your burger . being recently gluten-free myself i love that i can just ask for this menu and eliminate the guess work . plan b keep up the good work ! 
hmm how should i start . . . . i heard great reviews was very excited to try . it was first of all in the ghetto ( newark ) . my husband was nervous where we had to park our car , so we eventually moved it to right in front of the restaurant to feel safe . the chef gave us a little start of . . sliced fig with duck which was really good , my husband ordered the tomato salad as an app , it was impressive . i ordered the chicken pot pie and my husband ordered the bronzini as our main entree . my entree was thouroughly disgusting ! ! it came out with so much nasty egg on the crust and the inside was like a runny nose . . all i could taste was egg . . my husband ' s fish tasted like nuclear fish from the hudson river and when he gave me a bite i had to spit it out in my napkin it was that bad , besides the fact that his fish came with " chef risotto " a . k . a . butter rice pilaf , supposedly it was saffron rissotto yet no saffron was in it ! the place was loud and hard to carry on conversations , service was super slow took along time to get our food . they tried to make up with irish cream and chocolate after the meal but we just wanted to leave . upon exiting we were greeted by the hostess who was also getting her car and guess where she was parked directly in front of orange squirrel . . when there is absolutely no parking in the ghetto you actually allow your employees to park in front of the restaurant epic never going here again and will never miss lol gross ! what an ending to a disappointing meal . . 
tinto is just splendid . get the chicken brochetas - simple dish , yet the garbanzo puree is pure genius . i love this place . tapas galore . the menu here is fun , and welcomes shared plates . the drinks are unique . the menu has variety . only downfall - the prices aren ' t always worth the platter content . try amada in old city . this pearl is equally charming . 
could be better
love this place ! yesterday was my first visit to the double windosr and i will definintely be returning . it features great food and i felt at home as soon as i arrived . i ordered the incredibly succulent burger ( topped with melted cheddar and crisp bacon ) and a side of fries . it was obvious that all ingredients were top quality , and my food was prepared to perfection . others in my group ordered the burger , grilled cheese and the specials of the day- chicken arugula sandwich and creamy tomato soup , and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food . while we didn ' t drink on this visit , others seemed to be enjoying the wide variety of beers that are featured . staff were extremely friendly and accommodating . don ' t miss this place- it ' s a gem ! 
while driving past this area saturday night , i had a sudden case of the munchies and suggested we pass by for a late night snack . i ' m so glad we did . although this is not a datenight place , if you live in the area ( i live uptown ) , this would totally be one of my spots . i went for the hainanese chicken and rice ( small portion N . N ? ) , roti canai and malaysian iced coffee . total bill N . N . i ' ve heard all about the hainanese chicken and this place is suppose to have one of the best . i loved it . they serve a really nice chicken soup before the meal which imo was a kick ass chicken soup . the place is a bit scruffy from the outside . we drove past it twice before we saw the place . it ' s right next to the asian supermarket . if we ' re by the area again i ' m def returning to try more malay goodies on the menu . my experience was all positive . ) N N
loved this place from day N . whether for brunch , lunch , dinner , or drinks , coppelia has been as consistent as it gets . i usually piece together small plates like the chicarron de calamar , mac and chicharron , fish tacos , empanadas , but everything i ' ve had here is good . great value ! 
wonderful for a laid-back , casual french dinner on the weekdays--i live down the street and always bring a bottle of red to wash down a fresh salad--watercress or otherwise--spicy chicken with a side of fries . my sole gripe is that we always end up staying till close , which is a touch early , at N . Npm . 
without a reservation , my group of four walked in on a friday night at Npm and ended up waiting N . N hours before we got seated . walk-ins will only get seated at the bar area . i definitely recommend a reservation ! ! ! love the decor . great food . appetizers were overall better than entrees . what we got pretzel dusted calamari - the marinara sauce had just the right amount of zest to it and the breading on the calamari was awesome . it was tasty , didn ' t fall off and it didn ' t get soggy ! tomatoes , buffalo mozzarella and basil whole wheat pizza - delicious cheese , delicious sauce , delicious crust ! ! so good ! ! i could definitely come here and just get the pizza and leave happy . crab toast with lemon aioli - this was light and refreshing . my least favorite of the three appetizers but still good . roast suckling pig - oh my gosh ! ! ! this was soooo yummy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! favorite of the entrees kasha and bow tie pasta with veal meatballs - i enjoyed this red snapper - didn ' t care for a particular spice in this meal ( can ' t put my finger to it but it tasted a bit like black licorice ) arctic char - this was okay cookie plate - really enjoyed the " fig newton " , thought the chocolate chip was too salty , my sister adored the marshmallow peanut butter bar , the jam sandwiched between shortbread was good service since we ate at the bar area , there wasn ' t much table space , the stools were extremely uncomfortable and it was a bit more cramped overall . at times we felt like our waiter service was a bit slow but it probably would have been fine if we weren ' t so uncomfortable on our stools ! we theorized that they made the bar area seating so uncomfortable so that they could turn it around quicker ! haha
i have been coming here since it opened and was struggling . the food , but more importantly momma and her wonderful personality has kept me coming back . the best thai in north jersey - bar none . everything is exceptional . prices are reasonable and byob makes it that much better . 
a colleague recommended grant ' s for happy hour . i am not big on the crowded bar scene of happy hour so as always i asked to be seated and perused the regular menu . i was happy to discover there is a tavern menu . the tavern menu offers more options than the happy hour menu but at essentially the same price point . score ! i had the bbq pulled pork sliders , and clams casino . the portion size for the sliders was more than i expected and the pulled pork was delicious . i was equally happy with the clams casino . my girlfriend ordered a cheeseburger from the dinner menu and said that it was cooked perfectly . i thought the service was average but the food was good and i look forward to returning for dinner . N . N stars . 
the food is amazing . the owner was extremely kind and welcoming , certainly is proud of his business . the food was a little overpriced , but i won ' t let that affect the way i feel about the food . i can ' t wait to keep going there . 
ike gave me my sandwiches himself . dutch crunch bread is a must-try though my wife got wheat and it was great as well . fantastic root beer selection ! 
best pulled-pork sandwich
a great place to go for a convenient , quick , healthy meal . it would get five stars from me if it weren ' t so overpriced . i love the bacon , egg and kale sandwich . and the chicken thai curry . and pretty much all the salads and prepared foods at the counter are great too . it ' s a great place to come for take-out when i want to eat something healthy and don ' t have time to cook . everything is organic , fresh and gluten-free . all that said , the place is cafeteria style . often it ' s crowded , there ' s not much seating and there ' s not much ambiance . so i don ' t recommend it for dining in . if you want a healthy meal with full service , try souen , the macrobiotic restaurant around the corner . 
i have been to bar bruno twice now in a week . the frozen margaritas definitely brought me back . i crave them now . . . . especially now that it ' s spring and summer is on the horizon . the kale salad is amazing fish tacos are good . plantains are really good almost feel guilty eating them , it ' s like dessert in a good way . i also became addicted to the chips and need to learn how not to eat them all before my meal ! will be back and will bring a round of friends for sure . looking forward to warmth and margs at bar bruno ! 
amazing place . best meal i have had in a long time you start with a nice wine talk with their sommelier wine merchant at the front wine boutique . the the friendly maitre d takes you to a table in a very intimate , colorfully yet elegant restaurant . service is superb throughout the evening . crabcake with smoked gouda topped with prawn and a delicious sauces . a vinho verde with good acidity level and flavors of fiji apples and gooseberries was a perfect match . circumstance N merlot from south africa reminded me that the varietal deserves a spot in the limelight . enjoyed the braised lamb shank with grilled lamb sausage - truly delicious . but again it is about the total impression . the people , colors , food wine . . . . it all goes so well together . will be back soon . 
my boyfriend and i wanted to try a new place , so we stopped by vermont pub and brewery . the beer selection is great - a sampler is available for N , where you select the six beers you ' d like to try from a list . i ' m not a beer person . in fact , i hated beer , until yesterday . the " forbidden fruit " is a delicious , light , raspberry infused beer , that barely tastes like beer . a definite must try ! i had the cajun fried calamari ( about N ) and mesclun salad ( about N ) with the honey-chili vinaigrette ( the only home-made option ) . the calamari were really quite awful . it seems like they were poached in oil rather than fried . they were small , soggy and greasy . the salad was one of typical greens and julienned carrots , and the vinaigrette had a nice hint of spice . my boyfriend has the top sirloin steak ( nicely cooked and flavourful ) with salad and steamed broccoli ( also nicely cooked ) . service was friendly . overall , a good place to grab a drink or a bite , but the calamari are to be avoided . 
hands down , best bang for your buck for a boozy brunch in nyc . time and time again , this place pleases my friends and i for our group brunch . they only take weekend brunch reservations for a N o ' clock seating or a N o ' clock seating to limit boozy brunch-comers to N hours . it ' s enough time , especially with the staff being on point with their service . you must make a reservation far in advance . i ' m talking N weeks to a month . typically my girls and i will make a reservation while we are there for the next outing . it works wonderfully . the place is always packed ! from the moment you are seated , the attentive staff will get you a glass of sangria from the many choices . i ' ve probably tried about N N of them and they are all good ! one of my other favorite parts about calle ocho is the bread basket ! yum ! ! the bread is always warm and the delicious strawberry butter is amazing . as for the entrees , many are delicious . i wish there were more options , or that they rotated the menu seasonally so that i wouldn ' t always order my favorite dish , the torte de pollo . food comes out very quickly , so eat slow and keep on boozin ' ! N or N glasses of sangria later , we all leave happy , full and quite drunk . it ' s easy to get a lot of drinks during your visit , even with the crazy rule that you can only have one glass of sangria at a time . if you have some left , better chug it before the waiter comes back , because they will take it away ! i ' d recommend the later seating , at Npm , because they likely let you stay later than N and you can get an extra glass and finish it in the bar area ! or at least i ' ve done that before . 
no really , it ' s the best cheesesteak in the illadelph ! i don ' t care what people may say about the other ( very worthy ) establishments , john ' s cheesesteak is phenomenal ( my mouth literally just started to water and i haven ' t been there in a month ) . the hours are very limited but this place is not only worth the trip - it ' s worth playing hooky for . there are some tables outside and there ' s not a lot of room inside but if you want a posh atmosphere i think you ' ve stumbled upon the wrong review for the wrong type of food . a word to the wise , they call it john ' s roast pork for a reason so i suggest bringing a few bucks to get one of those as an appetizer while your steak is cooking or to bring on the road with you for dessert . 
someone in the kitchen is very creative and had some really amazing dishes . however , i assume because it was restaurant week , execution was a little off . green eggs ham inspired ! especially pickled honeydew melon ( ? ) gave just enough acidity to cut the unctuous pork belly ( ' ham ' ) . bison sliders had a nice smokiness , calamari ' noodles ' quite good as well . mango chipotle chicken , pretty good ( not great ) idea - chicken breast was a bit dry , and ( canned ? ) jalape os ( not chipotles ) didn ' t match well . bad news the cheese whiz potato gratin was burnt on top , to the point i could smell it ( with a cold ! ) . waiter brought back a slightly less burnt one , but the bottom was dry , and he left before checking to make sure it was okay . really , it looked N better than the first attempt . not worth sending back twice - it was probably cooked in a big pan , and end of the night probably didn ' t have another handy . he should have explained , in any case . didn ' t finish it but i would go back . still , why do places turn off quality control during restaurant week when they should be showing new customers why we should come back ? hoping to upgrade to N s next time i go ( not during restaurant week , thank you very much ) . oh , forgot to mention , cool cocktails ! pretty happening bar . that block is fast food chains local pizzerias sandwiches , but you feel like you ' re at Nth sansom instead of Nth ! worth the walk from the residential part of cc . also , price quantity quality ratio was there ( i checked out the normal menu ) . 
delicious ! pork buns were fantastic , but i think i actually like momofuko ' s slightly better . ramen great as well . they take credit card , btw . service was impeccable . no wait on sunday around N Npm ( for N person ) but it seemed like a pretty short wait for couples . 
i enjoy el rey . . . i love the decor , there ' s never a shortage ofthings to look at on the wall . the first time i went my eyes were way bigger than my tummy ( which is rare ) . both times i ' ve been we ' ve had the mango margaritas . . . yummmy . the fundido was not so much to my liking , greasy and just too much . . . . my last visit was for brunch , and it was delectible , also accompanied with mango madness , its never too early . i find the place even more interesting to me , because maybe a mere N , even N years ago , i used to frequent this place a lot , when it was a diner . when i look around i can see the old wood paneling , and rember pouring in and saddling a bar stool at N in the morning , gorging on a short stack . . . ahh memories . 
nice food , friendly staff
i used to have breakfast here once a week and it never got old . the thick , stuffed french toast is to die for - the stuffing changes all the time . pancakes are the size of frisbees . i think i ' ve had the huevos rancheros more times than any human being should . most breakfast items come with locally baked bread and their home fries , which are spicy chunks of potatoes with peppers and onions . it ' s a byob and the lunch and dinner specials are constantly rotating to keep things interesting . their salads are meals within themselves . delicious . fresh . amazing every time . i love you sabrina ' s ! 
this our go to our go to spot to have a great night out with my friend . their food is to die for and their drinks are the best ever ! ! ! 
wow ! wonderful soup ! this is the kinda soup ive been looking for ! the workers were so friendly , kind and let us sample as many soups as we wanted . everything we tried was just incredible ! it was really hard to decide . a in my book . 
turn the goddamn music down ! at two in the afternoon on a weekday when you have three customers why do you have to blast the music so loud i can ' t have a conversation with the person next to me or hear the bartender ? pyt can be fun for late night for partying and N ' s dance music or sitting outside w an adult shake ( away from the stupidly loud music ) during the day but thats about it . burgers are somewhere in between fast food and restaurant quality and are only distinguished by the endless variety of toppings . krispy kreme burger ? no thanks
train your servers to listen to the customer . to hear the words and not make assumptions . servers this should ring true for you especially if someone elses experience with you dictates your income . no you just showing up and looking pretty means nothing without a polite and classy demeanor . i had to basically almost yell at my server after asking her four times for a wet clean rag to be brought to the table i was seated at . well why the wet rag you ask ? its something so out of the ordinary to order you say ? the rag was so i could wipe the sticky residue and mess off the table i was seated at . you could not see it so the oversight was no big deal . however the funny faces coupled with the dumb founded look that i recieved when i asked for a wet rag was too much . ok maybe she wasn ' t used to being asked for that , maybe that was the problem ? well no she was just either rude , incompetent or another proud middle school graduate . if your at work pay atention to what your customer is saying to you . the silly girl kept bringing me wet napkins , and gave off an extremely rude vibe . if your customer has to clean their own table then you probably shouldn ' t feel entitled to give rude looks or make stupid faces . hire people that can listen when you put them in positions where N percent of their job is listening . i have been here N times and it is a mediocre mega bar but this last time will probably be the last visit . 
this place has above average food and the service is even better ! i can come here at N pm or N am and they keep the same level of service and quality at any time ! 
i love jose tejas ! i go all the time . it ' s really worth the trip because the food is cheap and delicious . i can eat the chips and guacamole all day . try the quesadillas , they are amazing . a lot of the items on the menu are a bit spicy though . my only complaint is that the wait is always at least a half hour here . on the weekend during dinner time you can be waiting for up to an hour . the restaurant is pretty loud too which can be quite annoying at times . 
food was average - on par with most chinese buffets . table was dirty and so was silverware . overall impression was tat it wasn ' t the cleanest place overall . some people were doing some serious eating in there ! ! ! ! some arguing over crab legs , too ! never seen anything like that before . 
sat at the bar . don ' t even think about sitting at a table . asked the chef to feed me until i was full . best sushi experience of my life . pros fresh fish . awesome rice . being asian , i eat a lot of rice ( i . e . , at least two bowls a day , everyday ) . the rice served here was just as good as the rice i cook at home , and i only use the best . my sushi chef , mitsuru , was friendly and accommodating . loved the atmosphere ( i . e . , simple and clean ) . cons - N . N hour time limit . then , they rush you out . 
we wanted to try the monk room but it was closed so we came here instead and we were pleasantly surprised . we ordered a large clam casino pizza and it was a good size for the four of us . the pizza was good and staff was excellent . 
my boyfriend and i came in for brunch soon after the bsbh opened . i ordered the quinoa salad , which was pretty good , but the portion size was smaller than i expected for a N vegetarian salad . however , what made our experience two star was the service . our waiter didn ' t seem to know the menu , was scattered , and not terribly personable . we attributed the mediocre service to the staff still getting settled , but weren ' t particularly excited to give it another try . this past friday , we were looking for a casual place for dinner , and decided to give bsbh another chance . afterall , it ' s in a great location , and has a serious beer selection , and outdoor seating . our first strange interaction was with the host . we requested a table by the open windows , so we could feel like we were outside , but avoid the impending rain . the host was silent for a good N seconds--staring at us , at the table chart , at the tables we asked for . finally , he grabbed menus and we followed him to the section . immediately , we could tell he was going to put us at the table closest to the kitchen and bathroom , despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty . we quickly asked if we could take a different table . this request was met by yet another ( extremely awkward ) N seconds of silence and staring before he put our menus down and allowed us to sit . finally seated , the waitress came over immediately and asked us for our drink order , clearly before we had a chance to look at the menu . we asked for another minute to read over the extensive beer list . N seconds later , she showed back up , asking for our drink and food order . we inquired about specials , to which she replied that she ' s not used to saying them , because people always read them for themselves on the chalkboard ( we had our backs to said board ) , which made us feel a little stupid . we ordered the veggie burger and the chicken sandwich . both were edible , but not great . the veggie burger came in a pita , and was probably the size of two standard patties , which was slightly unappetizing . the chicken sandwhich had so much cheese on it , you could barely taste anything else . the best part of the meal was the rejuvenation beer cocktail ( hefeweizen , rye , lavender syrup , lemon juice ) . overall , bsbh is disappointing . we might come back here for a drink , but would definitely sit at the bar . 
the best indian restaurant which i ever gone in connecticut with very good food quality and customer service . 
five stars for soup dumplings alone ( crab or pork ) are simply amazing and better than the other ones i ' ve had in chinatown - and i grew up here ! ! ! ! 
decor is beautiful . we were seated in the party room in the back . great for groups - we had a party of N and there were no problems with the food coming out . had the peruvian combo which was one whole chicken and fries and an avocado salad . yum . had the orange ceviche which wasn ' t the best ceviche ever . dulce de tres leches was delicious ! ! every bite was like heaven . why is the sanitary grade a c ? i ' m kind of creeped out by that but i lived to write the review . . . . 
good spot to grab groceries and have a glass of vino with a snack . half or full carafe , you choose . i love that they have oysters and chorizo here . the low lighting sets a chill mood as does the dark wood . if you get hungrier for more than a snack , diner is just next door . if youre not so much a wino as i but like your mary ' s bloody , have one here . they spice it with something extra that gives it a real kick . 
delicious food and fun atmosphere . i recommend to go here for after work or on the weekends . the grits are soo yummy and the mini muffins they give are absolutely delicious . 
i was in philly for a fourth of july getaway with a friend and we walked past this place on the way back to the hotel . the lemon walls and bright red flowers really stood out in the comparative drabness of downtown so we decided to do some research which led to a reservation for sunday night . we arrived and were seated promptly . the interior was chic yet comfortable and we settled in . unfortunately service was very slow at times . i think they weren ' t expecting such a busy night on a holiday sunday , and were thus understaffed , but for a large and established restaurant like this , such things should be anticipated . luckily the food more than made up for the service delays and when she made it to our table our waitress was knowledgeable and professional . i took a chance on a date and chestnut appetizer that turned out to be a real highlight . it matched my mojito perfectly . speaking of the mojitos , they were perfectly balanced and very fresh . the steak i had for a main was juicy inside , a little crispy on the outside andcooked to medium rare perfection . the crab salad side was also memorable . however the highlight of the meal for me was the coconut banana tres leches desert . i had been craving tres leches since we made the reservation and it didn ' t disappoint . the cake was the perfect consistency , the toasted coconut well seasoned and the the entire dish came together exceptionally well . i can ' t give alma the fifth star given the service delays but i would guess that our experience was not the norm here and the overall experience was still excellent . i ' d certainly recommend a meal here . 
khmer kitchen was my first experience with cambodian food and it has easily become one of my favorite restaurants in philly . you can ' t go wrong with anything here . everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly . all the dishes are flavorful and fresh , and more importantly , they ' re consistent ! my favorites are the lok lak , pleah sach-khoe , mussels , fried frog legs . i ' ve tried almost everything on their menu and have yet to be disappointed . i once brought a couple of skeptical ( cambodian ) friends and they ended up loving everything , exclaiming how authentic all the dishes were ! also worth mentioning , their one only waiter , tony , is super personable and attentive . so go out of the way and venture down to khmer kitchen , you won ' t be disappointed ! 
holy greek food batman ! this is the best food truck in the city , hands down . if you haven ' t tried it , you don ' t even know . uncle gussy hooks it up , and hot damn is it good . the service is fast , the greek friends are too good , and the tzaziki sauce is some of the best ever . get the lamb , get the salad , get it all before i come in and take it . try this place , or else . 
i went to buvette for sunday brunch with my friend . we ended up waking up a little late , so we arrived at around Npm ! we wanted a table so we had to wait around N minutes , but we did have the choice of sitting at the bar ! either way , the wait wasn ' t too bad . it was so busy that the servers couldn ' t get to the people waiting at the door though ! maybe they should hire some more staff for busier shifts . as for the food , i ordered the croque forestier with orange juice ( which wasn ' t really orange juice , but some other delicious juice that cost N . N ) . i loved the croque forestier so much- every vegetarian ' s dream croque ! overall , i think that this cute , french place has a great atmosphere . however , it can get so busy that they should hire some more people . 
i have loved this place since first visit . the food is amazing . i love the unique pairings , they amplify the flavor of each dish . i first tried the popular lobster roll , and i loved it ! since then i ' ve been bouncing around the menu trying different things . there hasn ' t been anything i haven ' t liked- actually , i love it all . i definitely recommend coming here and trying something new . great quality delicious food ! ! 
great vegan food and atmosphere ! nothing like a cup of black metal in the morning ! 
good food but prices are too high . there are many other brazilian restaurant that you can pay less and eat the same type of food
a very dim lit dining area provides a good date atmosphere for dinner . it does have a very casual but intimate feel . the staff was also very friendly and helpful with our orders and gave good recommendations if we were up in the air . everyone seemed to enjoy their food and experience overall . i heard the brunch is their forte , so i will be back for this . plus , they also have a billiards table in the back that i need to go to town on ! buon appetito
third and final visit to max brenner tonight . i wanted to pop in for dessert as a " pre-birthday celebration " so we headed over at N N . we were seated quickly at one of their super tiny tables ( poor table choice guys , esp if you expect people to have drinks food ! ) . our waitress was nice enough . we ordered coffee and decided to go with the same sundae we had on our prior visit ( euphoria something or other with lots of peanut butter and bananas ) . we remembered what we were served last time , there are a couple photos in the album on yelp . we were served something drastically different . the bowl was not even half the size , there were two scoops of melted ice cream , way too much whipped cream , and just less of everything else . it was crazy that they charged N . N for that mess . at least before it was impressive , though not worth N . N , now it just makes me angry that i ever gave this place N stars . they ' re clearly trying to give customers less while charging the same amount and better food desserts can be had elsewhere for lower prices . goodness . 
this place is amazing . great food and such a cozy , romantic atmosphere . i came here with my boyfriend for a special occassion and we luckily got seated right away at a table that was basically behind the counter , probably the best seat in the house since it was furthest away from the door and next to no other tables . it is so tiny inside , but that adds to the charm . we shared a plate of their fresh mozzerella and tomato ( some of the best mozzerella i ' ve ever had ) and each got homemade ravioli . i had traditional and my boyfriend got a daily special that had smoked mozzerella inside ( delicious ) . plates are pretty small , but just enough to fill you up and the price is totally reasonable for the quality of food that you ' re being served . would definitely come here again and again and again . 
i tried the spicy beef noodle soup , pork bone noodle soup , and the dumplings . the dumplings were really tasty and great . well worth the N bucks for a large helping . the spicy beef soup was great . the noodles were firm and pretty delicious , though i didn ' t like the beef too much . it was a bit tough . the pork bone soup came recommended by a fujianese friend , but i didn ' t like it too much . it tasted a bit bland , and the noodles were not as great as they were in the beef soup . overall , this is a nice cheap place with good tasting food -- except maybe the pork bone soup . 
great wine list and great prices for the wine . great atmosphere , great food , what else can i say just a great place ! 
amazing pizza ! came here with a huge group and tried N pies . the service was great and the variety in the pies was really interesting . my favorite was the " sunset park . " this is a must stop for any pizza fan ! 
i am not usually compelled to write reviews but based on my experience tonight , the owner of this bar is a royal douche bag and i highly discourage patronizing this business . while our bartender was pleasant and poured decent drinks , my friends and i will never step foot in this place again due to the jerk of an owner and his belligerent demeanor toward everyone at the end of the night . he swore at his staff and customers ( us ) and told us to get the f out . seriously ? ! this is no way to conduct oneself or to treat customers , ever . as someone who loves to support local bars , and loves a good cocktail , this experience was a complete disappointment and i will not be returning . do not patronize ward iii . it sucks . all around , a gross experience . 
we enjoyed a wonderful N course tasting menu at battersby last week and i am still dreaming of it ! each dish was imaginative and full of perfect fall flavors . our stand out favorites were the house made flatbread with an insanely delicious whipped ricotta spread , the kale salad ( i ' m a sucker for delicious kale ! ) , the sweetbreads with spiced yogurt , and the lamb dish . 
the Nrd and Nrd halal cart is something of a legend in nyc , and it lives up to the hype . best halal , plus ingredients are relatively fresh for halal quality since turnover is so high . i like it with bbq sauce , but the white sauce really makes it . definitely worth a try for anyone in the city . 
outstanding neighborhood place with the best bahn mi sandwiches around . i go here twice a week and the N sandwiches can ' t be beat . i alternate between the pork and chicken sandwiches , but pork is my fave . order it spicy . 
two and a half stars . . . on star search that meant you did poorly . the food is delicious , but when the service is bad . . . it leaves you without the experience you were craving . the communication amongst server floor manager ( host ? i honestly don ' t know what the other guys roll was ) . we ordered meatballs to have before risotto . had to ask for them as our risotto came first . then we had to ask for water twice . mainly because the space is small and they had a hard time keeping our tables straight . pretty sure the table next to is asked do one order of meatballs and ended up getting N because we had asked . that ' s called poor communication and table placement folks . - blah . . . 
having just moved to astoria it was a treat to find a place as authentic and as welcoming as vesta . i love the pizza with ricotta . it ' s my new brunch favorite . the wine list is great , love stopping by after work . the staff is wonderful , i feel like part of the neighborhood . 
you should eat here ! i went with the family over the holiday weekend and we all completely enjoyed ourselves . the food was totally delicious - there were so many enticing options we had a hard time picking just one thing to order ! the portions were spot on and the service was impeccable . the timing of the meal went perfectly as well - we were not rushed , nor did we sit for too long between courses . we will definitely be coming back ! 
loud , but delicious . . . 
live jazz on thursday nights . very nice . service was lovely . very attentive . vibe was very habana circa N ' s with some like it hot playing on the projector . my dinner companion commented that he expected fidel to walk through the dining area in fatigues and a cigar in his mouth ! black bean soup was very good . . . . gave me some ideas on how to improve on mine . kale and avocado a salad . lacked some flavor . emapanadas had an amazing fried crust but the fillings were a bit blah and measly . they just didn ' t fill the empanada enough . otherwise , i think the lovely cocktail list , great service , chill ambiance and live music will keep me coming back . 
we went to perry street because of its reputation and a recommendation of a close friend . the food was generally very good , except for the burnt toast with the cheese course replaced by toasted " wonder bread " . our guest was away from the table when her baba au rum was delivered and ignited . what ? the wine service was horrible . wine standing service was horrible . . they just didn ' t pay much attention and the wine was never there when it should have been . a great dining experience demands better . 
food was excellent ! service could ' ve been a bit better . only complaint was how loud it was in there . will definitely be back though . 
came here during restaurant week after reading gael greene ' s review . the restaurant week lunch menu is very carb heavy . the three entree options are pizza , lasagna and roast beef sandwich . i started with antipasti misti and got to taste both pizza vongole and lasagna for main . the toast in the appetizer is way too hard to chew but i appreciate the anchovy and the prosciutto . both lasagna and pizza are gorgeous . for dessert i got to taste the peach cobbler and strawberry sorbet . both are wonderful . a glass of rose at N is lovely but overpriced . olive oil in open container on the table is gross and tasteless . service can be spotty - they serve food despite diner being at restroom , and take N minutes to bring a check . 
whether or not this may be located on " Nth street " , is calle ocho a place that can send you to cloud nine ? one of the great things about food is that it gives you a little insight into the culture of a people , and if you do it just right , the place you ' re enjoying your meal can help enhance the experience . when you first enter the location , you may think you might have made a wrong turn somewhere even though the outside awning is scripted with " calle ocho " , and that ' s because you step into a quiet hotel lobby that serves to a certain caliber of clientele . however , a conveniently placed sign pointing out calle ocho helps you realize that you came to just the right spot . as soon as you enter the door , an infectious latin jazz soundtrack plays as there ' s definitely some lively chatter at the location . the d cor is roomy , a bit classy , and is outfitted with moody lighting and various art pieces on the wall . as my guest and i were seated , in the busy establishment , it wasn ' t soon before long that our waiter came to us . our server was so kind , courteous , friendly and infectiously spirited we felt really comfortable asking about the items on the menu and what he might recommend . even when we made the silly choice of ordering two separate dishes , while he was gently trying to tell us in his own way that " dude , that is a lot of food ! " , he never judged us . i wish i had remembered his name -was it eric , erin , or maybe even sean ? - the best i could describe him is how he looked and that is a tall slender blonde man with short hair and spoke with a bit of a lisp . if you get him , you ' re in for some real great service . the bus staff were on the up and up as well as they were sure to check that our table was clean - even if it was just a single grain of rice on the table . the dinner selection was quite nice and just about everything on the menu seemed quite appetizing - but my craving for seafood kicked in and i zeroed in on the paella which did not disappoint at all . it was a great portion and the seafood was abundant - the whole dish was cooked to perfection . my guest was also having a great time as well as she ordered the vaca frites which she just simply wish she had more room in her stomach for . for those of you interested in the alcohol selection , i simply couldn ' t comment because my guest and i were decidedly having an alcohol free night - i know , a sin to do such a thing at a latin establishment . finishing off the entire meal was a sorbet my guest and i shared and it was amazing . three different flavors - coconut , passionfruit , and mango - each had its distinct flavor , and they all worked together to provide a great sensation on our tastebuds . summary - price it may seem a bit pricey for some , but with the portion that is given with the quality of food proves that entry is definitely worth the price of admission - d cor it ' s somewhat fine dining with a casual twist . the environment is lively but you ' ll still be able to hear yourself . a good place for a date - food at times abundant , the food here is simply great . it ' s savory , its sweet , it can be spicy . . . it ' s latin ! notable mention calle ocho does what many others have had a difficult time doing - having a fine dining latin experience that is festive , with professional service and an excellent menu with amazing results . giving a perfect score has never been this easy . 
this is awesomely awesome . the schawarma is amazing and so is the falafel . the greatest thing about this place is the ambience . its awesome . its al fresco . and i got a new hat ! ! 
good food , friendly staff . 
wow ! the restaurant looks great and they have delicious menu , yum yum . . i really like the cocktails here . had great and warm dinner time with family . 
best soul food spot in ny . the potato salad is incredible . the cabbage is great . i usually get the fried chicken with honey . 
the one star rating is not for the food or for the ambiance , but rather the disrespect and lack of value placed on us while we stopped in for desserts . on our wedding anniversary , my husband and i stopped in for desserts following a meal at a near-by restaurant . given that the place is quite small , we asked whether we might be able to have just desserts --we didn ' t want to take up dining space even though we weren ' t there during peak dinner hours . we were invited in and waited a bit for service . the wait didn ' t matter because we weren ' t in a rush . there were two servers working and it was clear that they were alternating service to new tables . we were seated at the same time as another couple , so one server ( the older of the two ) asked her colleague which table she wanted . her colleague , the younger server , was indifferent so the older server came and greeted us . she asked about our drink order and when we told her that we were only having desserts , she cleared the table of the appetizer and dinner settings and simply walked away . she never returned nor did she tell us that her colleague would be with us shortly . it was evident that as soon as she realized that we wouldn ' t be spending much , she didn ' t want anything to do with us . she quickly greeted the table next to us and failed to tell her colleague that we were still waiting for service . as frontline workers , wait staff are among the first representatives of the establishments in which they work . basta ownership and management should pay closer attention to how the establishment is represented . the behaviour of the older server was unprofessional to say the least . though the younger server finally did come to us ( after my husband asked ) and though she recovered the entire situation with grace , it was just too late . the worth and value of your customers shouldn ' t be placed on how much they are willing to spend at your establishment . every patron should be treated with respect and dignity . you have lost us as your customers and this is the story that our friends will hear when they ask us whether we have ever been to basta and what we think of it . 
this place lived up to its hype , although perhaps not to its price range . everything i had was very delicious , but nothing that was crazy creative to make me go " w . o . w " . the mac cheese was probably one of the best i ' ve ever had , the goat cheese tasted very smooth and didn ' t have that thick milky taste that it usually does . the little crunch bread crumbs baked on top was such a nice contrast to the creamy dish that i would probably ask for more of the crumbs if i could ! for entree , i had the roasted chicken breast with spatzle . the chicken was quite juicy , but not too much flavor to it . it sits on a bed of very , very buttery spatzle which was a bit too buttery for me ( if you didn ' t figure yet ) . but , still quite tasty nonetheless . i also ordered N scoops of ice cream for dessert but can ' t remember the exact flavors . but their flavors change quite often and i was pretty happy with all of them , so try something unique if you have room for dessert ! my friend had the apple tart ( ? ) or cobbler and liked it a lot . again , this place changes its menu ( or at least portions of it ) quite often to suit seasonal ingredients so . . . " life is like a box of chocolate , you never know what you gonna find ! " 
i have been back here many times , usually at the request of family members , who are fans . we have had some good pasta dishes and salads and wraps . 
love it ! ! ! great people , generous portions , very tasty food , great price ! ! ! ! 
i love dumplings , love . my ideal dumpling is a pork and chive in a thin , very silky , wrapper . golden fried dumpling managed to hit N of N on this one . the pork and chive was bursting with flavor and juicy . unfortunately these dumplings follow the same formula of having a thick wrapper . but hey , if you ' re in the metrotech area you get these bad boys at N . N for for . order three of those and you ' ve got a pretty decent meal for N . N . their scallion pancake sandwiches at N . N are fairly large , a perfect accompaniment to your dumplings . sadly , their pork was not up to my standards , it was pretty blah and i think it would have been much better if they used the regular chinese roast pork . however , as far as cheap eats goes in downtown brooklyn , this is it ! 
pulled pork sandwich and spicy fries . . . . amazing ! great little place , can ' t wait to try it again , no liquor license , but have no fear you can bring your own ! ! ! you can tell that love goes into the food , as opposed to a food supplier and a short order cook . this is one of those businesses that would blow up if it took online ordering ! 
amazing sushi for a great price . the jasmine bubble tea ( and the bubble teas smoothies in general ) are absolutely amazing . recommendations to order the angry dragon , the green godzilla , and the rock and roll . it actually makes me upset to see the N-N star reviews of this place- such misleading information ! 
i ' ve been to blue a few times now . every time i go i ' ve tried something different . and every time the food has been really great ! service-perfect . you couldn ' t ask for a better staff . very attentive and fast . the food also comes out very fast from the kitchen . bar-full bar . they make mixed drinks well . they have an above par beer selection and a great wine list . kitchen-very fast as i said earlier . the food has been consistently great for me . i recommend the goat cheese wontons though . so good . but everything i ' ve had here ( which is a lot ) is great . price-not too expensive . but not cheap . for dinner your bill can grow quickly . especially if you like to drink a lot like me . atmosphere-clean , elegant but not snobby . casual and homey . you ' ll love it . i recommend sitting outside if you can . it ' s beautiful . 
they really are no . N ! corn tortillas are made fresh and their carne asada tacos taste almost better than the ones i ' ve had in mexico . their pork might be more popular , but in my opinion the steak takes the cake . 
my recent visit was on a saturday night when a hockey team and hordes of folks heading to the theatre were out en masse . so we waited a loooong time for a table and ended up having to sit in the bar seating area . bleah . oh well - they don ' t take reservations until you have N personages . but the waitress we got was really really nice and attentive ! hubby i had their neopolitan pizza , which was good - i liked the crust but nothing totally special . others in our party had the butternut squash ravioli and pasta bolognese and seemed happy with their meals . what i really loved was their amazing bread basket - three kinds of bread - a regular italian , a focaccia-type and a soft and yummy raisin sweet bread that i gobbled up ! ) i even asked for more of this and got a full basket in return ! so - overall , wholesome , filling italian food - i would go again , but i have to agree with other reviewers that for this kind of food , the prices are a little high . and i probably would avoid saturday night from now on ! ) ps didn ' t get to check out the bathrooms - too busy for me to wade through the crowds ! ) 
i just noticed i never wrote a review for pat ' s when i was in philly in april . . . i don ' t know how i missed this one ! i did the touristy thing in philly . . . a cheese steak from pats . . . and a cheese steak from geno ' s . side by side . . . ready . . . go . i realize this is a touchy subject in this area . . . when you like your cheese steak . . . you love your cheese steak . . . and i think i like geno ' s better . i ' m ready for the hate mail . . . pat ' s is good . don ' t get me wrong . it ' s better than anything i would get in northern virginia - pretending to be a sub . . . but i like the meat , and the bread better across the street . sorry pat . i still love you ! xoxo
the best place in brooklyn . hands down . life changing . 
the best jerk pork in the state of ct ! ! ! believe it ! ! ! 
i had their grilled chicken sandwich and i must say it is the best one i ' ve had . i am absolutely obsessed with vietnamese sandwiches and i would say this place makes it perfectly . the crunch on the bread when you take your first bite makes you want to quickly eat the entire sandwich but you realize you want to savor the yummy taste . definitely need to try this place if you haven ' t already ! 
i selected one star just because i had at least to select one . . . after one year that we had been customer we call them to order the usually " one cheese pizza " and the didn ' t take our order . aout N minutes later they contacted us saying that our pizza would be there in N minutes . we thought that was really nice of them and they gave value at our fidelity . after that we waited outside N minutes and . . . . the results they called us thinking was someone else , no pizza for us ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i don ' t have words ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
it seems to be considered as a " hipster " hangout and popular with a certain crowd . . but food is not all that , at all . . . on top of it all , while the wait staff is nice , the servers behind the counter is another story . they are always female , and always with an entitled attitude . above all , the staff does not pay attention and not only let loitering go on on the steps of the residential apartment upstairs , some of them actually join in an put plates , drinks , and cigs on the steps . blocking residents . when asked to move when you are carrying laundry or garbage , patrons and staff both give you such an attitude that you think they are your landlord or employer ! rude and crowd with an attitude . i live upstairs and used to try to support their business , but never again . if you care about the behavior of an establishment and value kind , neighborly , and respectful behavior of any business , boycott this place . don ' t go . 
amazing food ! ! N just the best ! ! 
and old italian boyfriend introduced me to this place he knew the owner and we would go there with all his friends . that ' s probably why i will always be good friends with that ex- he put luzzo ' s in my life ! yes sounds simple but aren ' t the most pleasurable things always that way ? ? the thin crust pizza with the best toppings is to die for and always provides comfort . 
delish ! i had beef and spicy chicken empanadas and they were excellent ! they were juicy and when we re heated the left overs the next day it tasted even better . i do recommend the chimi chimi fries . yum ! ! ! i will definitely be there often ! 
brasilia grill is a great place for a group dinner . we came for a graduation lunch , had a reservation and were seated promptly even though the place seemed busy . the space is large , so they just kept opening up sections as more people came in . the servers were very sweet and attentive , and really looked out for those of us with eating restrictions . obviously , the reason to go there is the rodizio . the servers walk around with about N types and cuts of different meats ( chicken , pork and beef ) and put a piece on your plate . it ' s really fun seeing what they bring out . the meats ( at least what i tried ) were all seasoned wonderfully . the rodizio also came with the salad bar , which could have been good on it ' s own ! it had your typical make your own salads , already mixed salads , potato salads , beet salads , etc and a hot food section as well . if you ' re dining with someone who isn ' t too into meat- there ' s more than enough for them to enjoy at a very reasonable price . the sangria is also awesome . get a pitcher and you won ' t be disappointed . strong and not at all watered down . oh yeah . 
great experience this evening with connor- even being memorial day weekend , great enthusiasm and hospitality . was quoted a hour half and was seated just after N min . bar service was full but bartenders were speedy- so many negative reviews for this place but couldn ' t complain about one aspect of our meal , even brought out wet wipes upon finishing . we will definitely be back ! ! ! great summer hang our
a group of us came in for happy hour for the Nnd time , after having a good experience the previous time . food N N - i ordered the margarita pizza off the happy hour menu and the braised meatballs off the regular menu . both were very good . drinks N N - ordered the strawberry belini for the second time . it didn ' t taste the same when i had it the first time . i think they changed the ingredients ? never the less , its a N drink . service N N - our waiter josh was absolutely hilarious , he served us last time . very personal and very attentive , made sure we were all happy . atmosphere N N - beautiful decor , love the light up sign on top of the bar . can get quite noisy around dinner time , then dies down after . overall experience N N good , but with high expectations in the future . hopefully service stays consistent along with the food and drinks . they set the bar high . 
this is a funky , friendly , oh so tasty little cafe . as such it is N stars in the funky , friendly cafe category , not something that i give easily . but the intangibles here - the sandwiches are inventive and delicisous , the wall-sized menu board so packed that it takes several visits to unravel , the vibe so friendly and welcoming - that nothing else makes sense . highly recommended . make a point of it . 
have been going here for years so obviously we think the food here is great . i have a child that has finally hit his teen years so decided the other night i would have him buy the meal while i sat close by with my elderly father . watch out if you look like a young kid , they short changed him N for each platter we purchased , unbelievable . was very disappointed . 
so i walked into the building and made a left into the entrance of cooperage , very industrial and really good looking on the inside , makes me want a manhattan ya know ? i sat down at the bar and marveled at their selection of wines and whiskey obviously . . i asked a couple questions and their evening bartender surprised me in his knowledge and passion for cocktails ! nice draft list and a great recommendation from anthony and i settled on a wonderful glass of white wine ! looking at the menu and talking with my friend about the cool cocktails they came up with a manager chimed in and once again blew us away with the amount of knowledge known about the food and drink . . she told me about distilleries and aging casks . . . needless to say we had a wonderful time , great food great drinks and even better staff ! i cannot wait to have an excuse to come out there again ! 
this place is run with sorrow . i tried this place and had nothing but problems . 
i like the one on the blvd better . the south philly one is always full of drink a-holes . crab fries are out of this world good . and the beer keg thing , unbelievable . lol . sandwiches are above average . this place is a great place to hang out , watch the game , eat and drink . can ' t ask for more ? 
awful crowd at a fake irish pub . i liked it when it first opened , before they deported all of the cool employees . now there is nothing irish about the place except the beer . the food has never been worth eating , and you usually get a broad selection of pathetic middle-aged men ogling the young ladies who are shakin ' -it for free drinks . um . . . trying to end on a nice note , but it just isn ' t coming to me . . . um the bouncers are usually pretty friendly . that ' s really all i ' ve got . 
this is an amazing place to visit ! there are so many vendors and a variety of cuisines to suite any craving . you can wander for a couple of hours checking out all the vendor ' s and their wares . the market is clean and well lit . centrally located in center city , it is accessible on foot . a must see when visiting philadelphia ! 
i ' d agree with all the one-star reviews on yelp . i used to love going to this restaurant with my mother when she was in town . i went there last sunday night . first of all , the hostess ( same one that has been there for many years ) and a guest were at the front counter arguing . when you ' re in the service industry , you always try to appease the customer and make good on the mistake . the hostess did no such thing . she just kept talking down to him and at many times raised her voice or rolled her eyes in front of him . i felt so bad for the guest . this was just the beginning and pretty much set the tone for entire meal . the restaurant was N N empty but the server decided to seat us in a two table right in the middle of the restaurant so we could still hear and see the hostess arguing and everytime a server or guest walked by ( which was every N seconds ) , i got bumped in the shoulder and arms at least N times during our one hour meal . i ' m pretty petite girl so imagine what my guy friend was doing . he couldn ' t sit comfortably at all . i asked the server if we could move to a better spot ( i pointed to a N-person table against the wall ) since there were so many tables open . he asked another server and the server simply said " no " in spanish . thinking that we didn ' t understand , he made up some excuse about how the tables were reserved . funny because i pointed to the sign that said they don ' t take any reservations . he ignored me and just walked away . two minutes later , the same server sat two people at the same table i pointed to . the food has definitely gone down hill since the last time i ate there . the restaurant was empty yet the server rushed us along on our meal . didn ' t even let us enjoy our meal . the server kept coming and asking if we were done with our plates even though we said we needed more time every time . this isn ' t a fast food restaurant but i would have been better off eating at mcdonalds . i don ' t care if their prices are decent . it doesn ' t make up for the fact that the whole dining experience at this establishment is beyond bad . if i could , i ' d give them negatives stars on yelp . needless to say , il corallo trattoria has lost my business forever . my mom is coming into town in a few weeks and we ' re bringing our business elsewhere . there are better places in the city to go for good cheap italian food with great service and atmosphere . 
this place is amazing . the menu has so many good things on it , that my boyfriend and i just split a bunch of things both times we went so we could try more . i don ' t remember what we got , just that it was awesome . it helps that goat cheese is like my favorite thing in the whole world , and there are a lot of items with goat cheese . the staff is super nice and smiley , and the environment is very cute and clean . i ' m so glad this place opened up just a few blocks from my apartment ! i ' ll go again soon ) 
great taste , nice variety . 
great service , table side guacamole and mohitos ! one of our favorites , when we feel like mexican food and drink in hartford . could get very busy if there is an event at the civic center , but they know their business and usually staff up appropriately . 
not worth trying . my son and i went in february . i had a burger though the toppings were meager and the fries cold , my son had the sliders , served three , one was recycled and a hockey puck , the others were good , though the fries were cold . i gave it a shot again , because anyone can have an off day . the family sat down , wasnt too busy but couldnt get anyone to wait on us . a waiter came over and said someone was coming but they didnt come so we left . these a plan b coming to fairfield which will not likely make it if food quality and service is as poor as i experienced . better options like local and joes american in town . 
i like to support local businesses , but maclaomainn ' s never fails to disappoint . service has been mediocre in the past , but today , after joining a group of friends and sitting at a table for N minutes , i was rather rudely informed by the proprietor that i could not sit where i had placed my chair . granted , it was busy and crowded , but after the long wait for service , the first thing i heard from a server should not have been , " you can ' t sit there . " nor did he seem to have any inclination to accommodate me or our group in any way . congratulations to them for having so much business that they can throw mine away permanently . 
my friends and i walked in for brunch here a couple of days ago and it was overall good . i didn ' t have too high of expectations for this place but i left satisfied . i saw from the other reviews that the most popular dish here is the creme br l e french toast but i wasn ' t craving anything sweet that afternoon so i ended up getting the huevos rancheros , which wasn ' t all that great to be honest . however , i did get to have a few bites of my friend ' s creme br l e french toast and . . . it was amazing ! i ' m not from the area but when i am in philly again , i would want to come back just for that french toast . 
the jeffery was a bar i visited twice on my vacation to new york . the pretzels were a perfect appetizer , complete with beer cheese and amazing whole grain mustard , to complement all of the beers i was compelled to keep ordering ! i consider myself to have great taste in beer ( i worked at a micro brewery restaurant for years ) i was so pleased with the choices on tap and the knowledge of the employees there . maria was charming , efficient and you will want to be her best friend after having even the shortest conversation with her ! ) my second visit was on new year ' s eve and i sat at a table . lynn was our server , possibly the best service i ' ve ever had at any restaurant ever . she is like a serving ninja , seriously . every beer she recommended was the best thing i ' ve ever tasted . i would also like the compliment the yankee candle smelling bathrooms , and the outside area is pretty nice . install a fuzzy wall by my next visit please ! 
i have eaten there quite a bit recently . the food is very good , large portions , and extremely affordable . the service is top notch and the owners are very friendly . i have enjoyed the steak and cheese with mushrooms and bacon and last night ordered a sausage and bacon calzone that was so large , i have leftovers for lunch . in fact , i dropped it in my driveway when i got home and dusted it off as i did not want to let something so good go to waste . i would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a fun environment , good food , and friendly service . 
loved this place . have to try the tempured deviled eggs . 
we order lunch for the office there all the time and they are always amazing ! lunch for our entire office is ready in under N minutes and they always comp us free sodas because we order so often . i recommend getting the grilled chicken salad with mozzarella on the side . 
the dining room was beautiful , and the servers were attentive and friendly . we spilled a glass of wine ( the last of our bottle ) and the sommelier soon brought us each a complimentary glass . that was a nice touch ! the food was spectacular ! try the duck , the chocolate souffl and the artisan breads . this place is a must and is now our go to french restaurant in new york ! 
the waitress was friendly and helpful , and moved us from a table in a corridor into a more comfortable spot with a smile . the beer selection was awesome , and she was knowledgeable about it . we shared a huge plate of steamed mussels that came in an unusual and delicious broth , which included capers . we both had the build your own burger as a main , and i had the truffle mac n cheese , while my partner had truffled fries . my only complaint was that i couldn ' t finish my food , and had nowhere to store the leftovers in our hotel , so i couldn ' t take it home for later ! the tab for an excellent meal and a couple of drinks each was around N , which seemed reasonable for the quality of the food and the atmosphere , particularly with the sticker shock i ' ve been suffering at even humble eateries around here . 
recommended . we ordered wanton soup , dumplings and duck and enjoined . the staff is very nice . 
this place is N blocks from where i lived as a college senior and you can be assured that i wasn ' t usually coming here for the food . that said however their bar snacks were usually very satisfying , their nachos in particular ( the most filling vegetarian ones i ' ve ever had ) and the pommes frites were decent too . came here with friends once and the chicken wings were undercooked , but i feel that may have been just a one time fluke . great list on tap with N brews to pick from . the staff were typically very friendly however i do remember an instance when one of them shouted at everyone in the bar for banging their fists on the tables during a flyer ' s game . seriously this is philly , lighten up . overall however i have good memories of devil ' s den and feel its definitely a nice addition to a part of the neighborhood that was lacking in places to grab a great beer . 
i came here with a few friends for a late-night snack a few weeks ago . the place was pretty empty when we arrived and we headed toward the back to look in the refrigerators for something good to eat . they had quite an array of korean food , all of which looked pretty good in my ( uneducated ) opinion . i had the squid kimbap , which was pretty spicy and bigger than i expected -- delicious . the squid was a bit on the chewy side , but that ' s to be expected . the only other interesting thing to me was that they served up some kind of " tea " for free . although it was pretty weak , my friends told me people often drink that in place of water in korea , so that was a new interesting experience for me . this is definitely a great place to go for a snack ! 
i just loved daikokuya a lot more . lol
i know why some people would love this place , and i know why i don ' t . i generally like thin crust pizza , with a very well executed and somewhat complex sauce and perfectly portioned cheese on top that won ' t make you blow your gut and leaves you wanting one more bite . artichoke on the other hand , is the kind of pizza that ' s so heavy , that after N bites , you ' re asking yourself " should i keep going ? . . . it ' s kinda good , but kind of really bad . " my first thought was that it tasted like chicken pot pie . chicken pot pie ? why ? the creaminess of the sauce was heart stopping , but . . . kinda good . now that i read other reviews i realize it ' s supposed to be artichoke dip , but it really reminded me of chicken pot pie . except i like chicken pot pie because it ' s in a thin pastry crust , not a thick piece of dough . the dough is so thick and doughy and the sauce is so thick and creamy that it was kind of hard to distinguish where one ended and the other began . i didn ' t really like that my dough was expanding and soaking up the sauce . then after the first top half of the slice , girlfriend and i were looking at each other like . . . um . . . " i ' ll finish this if you will . . . " but i wasn ' t sure , because i didn ' t plan on eating anything else besides this tonight . except it felt so terrible for me i wanted to run home and eat some steamed vegetables . . . girlfriend said " i ' m still hungry , but i don ' t want to finish this . . . i think i ' m going to eat something else tonight " i went home to tell my roommate i ' d finally tried artichoke . " what ' d you think " . . . " i didn ' t like it " . . . she replies " me neither . i don ' t know why it ' s so hyped " 
one of the best sicilian squares i ' ve ever tried . very big squares though . only N is enough for me to fill me up . the place itself is a nice and cozy , the atmosphere is as well . i was passing by on my way to my friends house , i guess i will be coming here again . and of course i got some italian ices as well , just because it ' s hype , so i ' m definitely a regular customer of theirs . squares are highly recommended . 
went in for my bday . don ' t know what all the hype is about . we came in -N people , on a mellow sunday night . place was a bit busy but we noticed that there were N tables available and no one was waiting that we could see . however , the ' lovely ' hostess still insisted that we will have to wait for at least N min to be seated . we said ok and sat in our car that was parked outside . it was obvious that it was all part of the show and no one was waiting to be seated prior to us . N min later we got out hi-tech text msg that the table is ready . we walked in , shockingly the same tables were open and they seated us . praise the lord ! after all the anticipation , we got a snooty waitress ( we are all former industry workers and now owners of a high class restaurant so we appreciate service from another level i believe ) she definitely looked down at us from the beginning but to our surprise she softened up toward the end and was actually nice when we left , i guess that ' s because she got to go home -we were second to last table to close the restaurant for the night . anyway , for the food . . . we started with the fantastic grilled halumi cheese salad . great start . i had the house red cabernet ( i think it was the smith ) great wine . for entrees i had the ny strip steak -i asked for medium . it was medium but way too chard , lukewarm and incredibly dry because of their pretentious way of letting the meat rest for a while before it is served . my grandpa may he rest in peace , was a butcher , so i know my meat . this was only ok . my fiance had the hanger steak and so did his friend . both were inedible ! ! ! worst then eating charcoal . chard beyond words . who thought that a place that ' knows ' their steaks would allow itself to serve something so embarrassing . rest the meat . . . please . we asked the waitress for her opinion , i asked her to try the steak but she said it looks burnt . why serve it then ? ? i would say its disrespectful . . . to say the least . they attempted the steaks again , while i had to finish mine and eat alone . it really can ' t get any worse then when each person eats on a different schedule then the other , sometimes the food helps make up for a bad experience . def not in this case . anyway , the guys finished up their less then good steaks while i was sipping my wine . the sides we ' re good too btw , the truffle mash was yum ! and after all that we had to finish with my bday dessert . we chose the cheesy apple pie a la mode , it was wonderful . thank god . . ! we finished up and left , tipped the girl a N tip just because she ended things on a good note as far as her service attitude . bottom line- pretentious hostess vibe , inexperienced cooks , and sub-par steaks . most likely -will not go back , and im sure they won ' t admit they will miss me anyway . . . there are too many people waiting to get a table . enjoy dinner ! 
arrogant and inflexible management . feel cheated . i was a longtime customer here . i went in for dinner today and ordered the carnivore combo . the carnivore combo comes with a side of roasted potatoes . i ' m really not into potatoes , so i asked the server to substitute it with hummus sans toasted baguette ( hummus is also listed as a side on their menu ) . server said okay but there might be a small extra fee for the hummus . food came without roasted potatoes and with hummus as expected . all was good until the bill came . i was charged the full fee for the hummus . roasted potatoes are listed as N . N under the sides section and the hummus w toasted baguette was listed as N . N under the sides section . i was expecting to be charged a N . N extra fee at most , as most normal restaurants charge the difference in price when substituting sides . the server asked the manager , but the manager advised the server to continue to charge me the full price for the hummus . i asked to speak with the manager in person . i am not sure of his name but he is average height , in his Ns , balding , with a black beard , and a thick accent . after i mentioned that i was a longtime customer and that i felt cheated because i had asked to substitute my potatoes but was now being charged for a full extra side , he seemed rather arrogant , rude , and did not back down from his initial position . i told him that i will never set foot in atticus again , paid the full price with N tip , and left . if management continues to be so short-sighted , think only in terms of short-term profits , and be so inflexible on such matters as trivial as switching sides , this business will be going downhill fast . i will never eat at atticus again . i regret not asking for my side of potatoes and toasted baguette after speaking with the manager since i paid for them as well . 
this is the second time the service at this place has made me swear that i will not return to london grill . i broke that promise to myself a few weeks ago because the last time we were there , because the grilled octopus and potato pizza were so good that i thought i could deal with some mediocre service . but when we went , not only was the service abysmal but the food was bad too . not even mediocre--bad . the grilled octopus was burnt , not grilled , and was cold not room temperature by the time it got to us . it was beyond chewy , it verged on tooth breaking . the pizza , which i thought no one could really mess up , was just plain not good . instead of slices of potato , there was chunks of potato . like they were taken from the same pile that they use for mashed potatoes . and the service . we sat outside and it took a long time for someone to help us . in fact , we had to flag down a bus girl to ask if we could get menus . and we had to get a set of utensils and napkins from the waitstation ourselves . the beers were warm when we got them and rather than wait for our vanishing waitress to come back and get us new ones , my boyfriend went inside and got a new one from the bar . the bartender commented , yeah , they were sitting on the bar for a while . this was the theme of our meal . disappearing waitress , cold food , angry diners . and as we walked to the car , we passed the happy diners at zorbas and i really mean it this time . i ' m not going back to this restaurant . and i ' m telling anyone who will listen not to go here either . there ' s better places for beer and better places for food ( and even some with outside seating ) and much better waitstaff in fairmount . beat it london grill . 
i ' ve been wanting to try this place for quite sometime . . . i wish i had tried it sooner . . . loved it ! great change for a meal out instead of the typical fare . . . lots of variety and informal atmosphere and the kebobs are awesome ! 
we stumbled upon this restaurant during business lunch . i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised . the atmosphere was comfortable , not too loud but lively . the waiters were very efficient and extremely helpful . we ordered the mozzarella burrata and the veal wild boar meatballs and both were very good . i had a bowl of pasta fagioli to start and the grilled sword fish special which both were very good as well . the fish was a tad dry but i ' m just being picky . i would definitely recommend stopping in for lunch or dinner , you won ' t be disappointed . 
my wife and i were displaced by sandy and found temp housing almost right above peaches . we have been going almost every night and i have made it through almost the complete menu and have loved it . the staff is so friendly and nice . the manager milo always greets with a smile and a handshake . i will be coming back even when we finally get to go home to long beach
started off with our usual . . . fried goat cheese in a wonton , delicious ! hubby had the lamb shank , meat was falling off the bone with a side of rissotto , good combo . i had the feta chicken with a side of mash , very good moist and tasty chicken ( i try chicken everywhere and this was perfect ) . for dessert we had the daily special warm pecan pie with side of vanilla ice cream . perfect way to end off a great meal . i ' m so sick of italian restaurants in si , so i definitely thank julian for bringing us this great option alongside beso and bayou ! came on a friday night , good thing we got here bN N , it was packed with a wait by the time we left . waiting bar area is really nice though ! 
one of my new favorite lunch places . really delicious and customizable burgers . try it now . i also checked out the kami truck next to the spot ( similarly owned ? ) . . . which has korean bulgogi dishes and it was also really delicious . two awesome food trucks ! 
my friends and i came here because of all the good reviews on yelp and we were excited . we ordered the breakroom fries and the taco platter , steak , chicken and pork . the fries came first and they were really good but i don ' t think it was enough cheese on ours . the tacos we cut them all in half to share and it didn ' t taste that good to us . the tortilla was really dry and rough and the meats were all bland and dry . we expected better but it was eh . probably come back with my boyfriend so he can try the fries ! 
ing cafe ' s little fairmount sister . 
drinks are way over priced , food over priced and now that the chef left , food is being made by uncertified staff . same bad djs every week and owner is old with no concept of how to run a bar . if i could give N stars i would ! johnnies , sharkeys , mattadona , elks lodge , and reservoir tavern all better choices for boonton to eat and drink ! terrible bar . 
best pizza in the world in my opinion ! ! ! have been so many times and it never disappoints ! ! 
 . if anyone thinks this is " authentic mexican food " they have not been out of nj--not even out of bloomfield , nj ! we were really looking forward to a true mexican experience given the reviews , ratings etc . the food lacked flavor , many items seemed as if someone opened a can , the chile con queso was velveeta and almost soup consistancy , with a few chopped tomatoes thrown in . we asked for salsa verde and were given a verde sauce which had no flavor of tomotillas and only a hint of jalapenos . carne asada was filled with onions and the meat was tough , chicken enchiladas had little sauce and cheese and the flavor was more barbeque than mexican you are much better off at the old el bandito in orange--now sold and renamed ( i think its called el rancho grande on main st , near w . orange boarder ) but still good . certainly much more authentic . 
love it here . clean fresh . and great service . will come back . it ' s very romantic . came here on a date the first time . now with my bff . 
we ' ve been going to star tavern for years . the food is amazing . we ' d go every week if it wasn ' t so unhealthy . some of our favorites are the buffalo wings , mista salad , meatball parm sub ( on the small side , but perfect , with a nice toasted roll , very good meatballs and lots of cheese ) , eggplant parm ( sub or full dinner their eggplant parm is amazing it is baked , not fried and has no breading , but tons of cheese and sauce ) , occassionally the fried calamari and , of course , the pizza . all the pies are really great we like , plain , mushroom , pepporoni , meatball and onion , and sausage and garlic . if you get there between N and N on a friday or saturday , expect to wait a long time ( particularly if you are more than N people ) . the service is not great ( i think mainly because the tables are so packed together and the line of people makes the place even more crowded , so the waitresses get frustrated and its hard for them to get to your table ) , but since we ' ve been there so many times , we know what we ' re ordering the minute we sit down . once the order is placed , we tell them to bring things out as they ' re ready ( rather than trying to bring things at the same time ) and , basically , its a food parade from there on out . we ' ve never had to wait long for the food once its ordered and its always delicious . i can ' t understand some of the negative reviews saying the pizza is tasteless . to me , it is some of the tastiest pizza i ' ve ever had ( yes , i ' ve had some better slices , but few and far between and i have not had better bar pies ( thin pies ) ) . go for the great food , but don ' t expect great service or a nice restaurant . 
five stars if you ' re a conservative mom visiting from out of town who only likes bland food and doesn ' t want to explore anything new but wants to tell her friends that she ate in ny . i was forced to go here by my california friend and her mom because they could recognize the food on the menu , aka pasta . ugh . i can ' t believe they ' re from california yet they are so narrow-minded when it came to food . oh well , it takes all kinds i suppose , it ' s not my kind of place , but it came in handy when i needed to feed these people and we were on st . marks amidst all the eclectic cuisine choices . 
the food here is good , and the baked goods are always fresh . their dinner menu is a good size and is pretty varied . the cod fritters were amazing , the artichoke salad is fresh delicious and for the entree i ' m a bigger fan of their pasta than their meat dishes . the decor is really cute and the atmosphere was laid back . the waitress was really attentive , and they didn ' t rush us out . one of my neighborhood favs ! 
went back again for dinner with some girlfriends yesterday , we had the sangria it was absolutely delicious ! ! ! would recommend to everyone ! 
right when you walk into this " hole in the wall " restaurant you ' ll realize the atmosphere is immediately unique . it ' s in a weird spot but do not judge a book by its cover . spontaneously , my boyfriend and i were both craving italian and it was our date night . yelp reviewers ranted about its delicious entrees . boy were they right . the moment you open the door countless awards cover the wall between the entrance and hostess area . i had never even heard of this restaurant and honestly , it ' s quite pricey . from the moment we got there- right up to leaving , the whole experience was romantic , delicious , and the servers knew what they were talking about . even the bread with olive oil and seasonings was flavorful . everything was excellent . i ordered the gnocchi genovese i believe it was and my boyfriend ordered the free range organic chicken , both were fabulous . my dish was cooked to perfection ! i didn ' t even need a knife to cut the meat , it was tender , like butter ! with the fresh organic ingredients they use , it ' s worth every penny . we will definitely be returning . if you have any doubts , just go , you won ' t regret it ! 
the food is okay , but the customer service is terrible . i ordered a burger with fries to go . when i got back to my apartment , i saw that they forgot the fries . when i called to tell them about their mistake , they refused to deliver it to me without charge even though they were the ones who forgot the order . this was after putting me on hold N times . take your hard earned dollars to another restaurant in the area . 
service needs a lot of work . the problem appears to be that there is no manager on duty , so you see the typical problem of servers standing around talking to each other and playing with their phones rather than the customers . the kitchen and food is a mixed bag , the food is actually decent , but , it takes forever . . . simple foods like burgers and fries which should only take minutes can take N or more . . . go if you have a lot of time on your hands and don ' t mind chasing down the servers yourself to get anything you need . i guess the management doesn ' t bother to read the reviews on their own restaurant . 
i think this may have become one of my favorite places in philly . the services was great and it has a great bottle beer list . my friend and i tried the thanksgiving balls and they were incredible . the menu is funky and offers many different dishes . i cannot wait to go back ! 
this is bar none the worst run restaurant . ever . i reserved a table for N weeks ago for my daughter ' s birthday . we arrived and were lied to that they were running a " bit late " . after one hour they then said the wait would be at least another hour . we then managed to switch from hibachi to the freezing cold dining room . i would have left but it was new year ' s eve and where would a party of my size go to without reservations ? we took up two tables . one table got salad the other did not . some people were served their food others were not . by the time i got my dinner i was no longer hungry and could not even eat it . i would like to say this was out of the ordinary since it was a holiday but sadly that is not the case . i have been here before and experienced terrible service but that was nearly a year ago and i assumed since they just opened they worked out the kinks . not so . the management is truly beyond incompetent which is sad because this could be a really great place . they also employ a nasty wait staff . when i accidentally bumped into a waitress no matter how many times i apologized all she would do is glare at me like i had attempted to murder her . fire everyone but the kitchen staff and start over again otherwise the public is going to catch on and you will be out of business . soon . 
my Nst time eating here for my birthday and i really enjoyed my dinner . i will be returning and recommending to friends . the owner and waiter was so pleasant overall a good environment . 
i grew up on the main line , and this is by far my favorite restaurant in the philadelphia area ! i can never say enough good things about the food , the service , or the drinks . service is always fast , attentive ( but not overly attentive ) , glasses are never left empty or running close to low for water , and the food is always cooked to perfection ! their classic mojitos are strong and the best mojitos i ' ve ever had ! ceviche will live in your dreams and the duck with creamed yuca is perfectly cooked and seasoned . 
my boyfriend and i decided to try out sanford ' s after having noticed that it is a popular brunch spot as it seemed busy with lots of customers . the food was pleasing , our waitress and runner were on top of their service . however , a cloud loomed over our heads as our entire brunch was ruined by the rude hostess . she was unprofessional with her inappropriate remarks that were unnecessary . the hostess was disorganized in the way she handles seating . 
pizza is average but it ' s really the staff that ruin this place . placed an order , waited an hour to only have half the order arrive . waited for another quarter order to arrive but they forgot the soda . they came back with the soda to tell me they didn ' t have a credit card slip for me to sign only for me to see they had written my entire credit card number including N digit cid on the order form ! guy says , " i ' ll charge when i get back . " get a call half an hour later , the guy had switched the digits and they needed my card . i asked whether they were still charging me full price as it took an hour and a half and the pizza was cold when it arrived . the response i got ? " you got your food right ? " just wow . only order as a last resort unless this is the experience you crave . i ' ve had delayed deliveries before where the driver goes to the wrong address and calls but is halfway across the city but it seems to have somehow gotten even worse . order earlier from somewhere else if you want hot pizza . 
would not go here again if you paid me - food quality was terrible , service was bad and got food poisoning after . 
we only had a few sides and some appetizers . based on those , i can say that the food was solid good . actually apps and sides made for a filling meal too ! we sat in the far back room which was a nice ambiance from the bar area . music was good and very upbeat , yet not clubby . 
eataly has a mall food court feel at gourmet manhattan prices . enjoy spending N on a meal while being surrounded by suburban moms . the prices they charge for items is shameful . N- N a pound for smoked meats ? what a joke . this is new york city . plenty of italian delis and top notch butchers where you could buy what they are selling at eataly at a fraction of the price . the only people that can afford to shop here is the N . of which many work on wall street in new york . but batali arrogantly decided to bite the hand that feeds him . but even if stupid mario didn ' t take a swipe at wall street , i would still give this place N star because there is no logic to shopping here if you live in manhattan . the only thing that could possibly rip people off more is if a top chef opened a french and organic version of eataly . using eataly pricing , brie would start at N a pound because french and organic are the two biggest buzz words in food to rip people off with . 
one of the best coffee places in new york to rival blue bottle in sf and the boatshed on balmoral beach in sydney . i live N mins away but religiously make the trek , it is that good . and try and resist their ham and cheese croissant and banana bread . ) ) 
best place for a quick and casual meal . friendly staff
i know my italian food and i only came here because carmine ' s was packed and it was with the family . the food portions are just about the same in size but not as top quality . we had a really sweet actress waitress who caused grandma no problems and recommended many basic dishes . i can ' t really remember what i had- might have been chicken marsala and broccoli rabe . something about it overall was just a little too bland and not memorable . i would maybe go back and order something different . 
food was acceptable . i had the vegetable fried dumplings ( N ) , which had great skin and filling , so much that it tasted like a pork filling at times . but considering the portion size ( N ) , it was pretty grossly overpriced . not that i ' m complaining . main dish was zhajiangmian ( N ) . honestly , good but nothing spectacular . sauce was pretty heavy and a bit too watery . at the very least it was hot and fresh , which was appreciated . ambiance was nice- they bill themselves as one of those chic ' asian fusion ' places , which seems to be an excuse to dress up food you ' d find at infinitely cheaper prices in flushing . if only it weren ' t so overpriced , i ' d probably come again for the convenience . 
this is definitely a great place to go for a birthday , business meeting and a date . but make sure to make reservations in advance . the food here was amazing when it came to the main course but the appetizer was a bit disappointing . the calamari appetizer was bland and rubbery , so you had to rely heavily on the sauce . but besides the appetizer the ravioli and lasagna were amazing . if you ' re looking for a cheesy dish the lasagna is the way to go . 
best , most authentic japanese i ' ve had in nyc . or anywhere else . period . nothing more to say about this gem , except that finding it is a bit of a " where ' s waldo " exercise that only adds to the mystique . great find . oh , and trust me get the chocolate souffle . ( yes , they have one and it is to die for ) . 
i love this quaint little french bistro . very intimate quiet . nice place for date night , or to just stop in and grab a bite . they have a great mix of small plates and entrees . what the truffled devil eggs lacked in appearance , they more than made up for in taste . i would also strongly recommend the burger . a simple delicious mix of ground lamb beef . great happy hour specials , and other deals to get you through the door matched with friendly service great food drink . how can you say no ? they also have an upstairs area perfect for small parties . 
the only thing that mark seems to do well is sliders , but at least they get their main item right . the regular sliders we had were perfect , and easily the best item , beating out the bacon ones we also had - the bacon on those was mixed into the burger and didnt really add anything . the non-slider items were not very good . we had cheese fries which my partner described as " bad cheese trying to taste good " - all you could taste was whatever spice they used in the cheese . the few fries not covered in the cheese sauce were better on their own . 
i was starving and in midtown village , debating about what to eat for dinner . i almost took the bus to university city . . . but then this place caught my eye . i was there about N pm on a beautiful saturday afternoon , and it was already hopping . i ' d hate to see how packed this place must get during primetime . great decor and atmosphere . . . i love the spinning tequila bar with the oscar de la hoya bike on top of it . the service was super friendly and gracious , which was much appreciated , especially as a solo diner . i was dying to try the guac , so i got it as a side with the homemade chips . yum . i ' m extremely picky about guac , and i approved , although i would have preferred more lime . my first drink was very interesting ginger liquer , infused tequila , fresh citrus , rimmed with some sort of ginger cream . i thought the cream was a bit much . . . i think a ginger sugar rim would be better . i felt kind of " dirty " , licking the cream off the rim as a i drank it , but maybe that ' s just my filthy mind at work . - ) my main was the pork pibil tacos . they were the perfect size and amount , although i would agree that the price seemed high for the amount that i got . the flavor was very good , but it was a bit too far to the bbq side for my taste . i ' m used to a much more juicy salty version of pibil . my second drink was also interesting , but not as innovative as i thought it would be . it was hibiscus tea , cinnamon-infused tequila . . . and something else that escapes me right now . it reminded me of sangria , actually . hard to explain . i decided to be a total hedonist and have dessert as well . the lime-chili sorbet was awesome . perfect texture , perfect blend of flavors . my mouth is watering thinking about it . overall , i would say it ' s very good , if a little pricey for what it is . 
after a terrible experience at N olde , i came here and got great bar service . 
pros the food is inexpensive and tasty , usually served very quickly . cons if you ' re looking for ambience and friendly service , go elsewhere ! the vibe of the place often matches the decor cold , stainless steel walls . with that being said , the service is efficient . knowing what to expect is half the battle ! they will refill your water but no one is going to come by and ask how you are enjoying your meal . it ' s more of a place to have a quick meal than to linger for all of these reasons . the soups are the best thing on the menu . my usual is a scallion pancake with curry tofu noodle with spinach noodle and all fried tofu . it ' s a bit spicy and has a flavor of coconut milk to the broth . i used to order curry chicken noodle frequently but they recently changed the style of the chicken pieces and i preferred the old style better . they load the soup with fried tofu when you order it that way , so that ' s my current favorite . they do package food nicely ( i . e . broth in a separate container than noodles ) when you order take out , so if you want the food with a more inviting , comfortable location , bring it home with you . it will still be hot and fresh when you get there . 
welcome to sunnyside ! ! ! ! had takeout the other night and boy was it great ! ! ! ! juicy burgers ! ! ! ! very good wings ! ! ! ! great staff ! ! ! wish you all the best ! ! ! ! wish you had the diet orange cream soda ! ! ! 
i just returned from dinner at the little owl and overall was disappointed with the experience . i was so excited to eat here after reading all the fantastic reviews . today is my birthday and i made a reservation about a month in advance and have really been looking forward to it . of course , the only time they had open was Npm even though i reserved so far in advance but i took it . ( surprising since through most of our meal there were tables free . ) overall , the food was tasty and very good quality - i had the meatball sliders and the porkchop , and my husband had the risotto appetizer and the crispy chicken . the complaint i have is that the service was really poor for the prices you ' re paying . i noticed halfway through our meal that we were definitely being treated differently from all of the other customers in the restaurant and this was made blatantly obvious when every group seated after us was read out a list of dinner specials , but we were not even asked if we wanted to hear the specials . the waitress never came by to ask if everything was ok with our appetizers , and never asked us if we wanted another round of drinks through the meal . she pushed dessert menus in front of us as soon as the bus boy cleared our entree plates away , and since by that point we felt so annoyed and rushed we didn ' t want to drop anymore of our money , we politely declined dessert . within N seconds of saying no thanks to dessert , our check was on the table . within N seconds of my husband taking out his card they snatched the bill away . now , i ' m all for quick service but this was a special occasion and when going out for a nice dinner i don ' t want to feel like i ' m being shoved out the door . i guess because we didn ' t order an N bottle of wine like the other customers we weren ' t as valuable to them . we were actually ready to order dessert and more drinks but decided not to once it was made so clear that they thought we were just taking up space in their restaurant . it ' s a shame , because the food was really good and i would have returned but with so much other choice in new york city , why bother when the service is bad ? 
comida excelente ! principalmente a picanha , muito macia e bem feita ! pedimos pelo telefone e chegou rapidamente no hotel ! atendimento foi em portugu s ! recomendo ! 
chicken torta sandwich ! ! ! what can i say about you , i ' m in love with you . . . but sorry i can ' t wait for you more than N munites . every time i call to pick you up , it takes you for ever to give me a bite . 
hands down by far the best out of the ' three new haven pizza joints ' the wait is not to crazy even if their busy ( they have more than N tables ) and by far the best staff . the people here are friendly ! ! excellent pizza , cold beer and the best calzones i ever had . ( ct . magazine says so to ) check it out . it ' s the best . 
this is nj . a state full of good indian cuisine restaurants . the kind of service and food we experienced at spice grill was beyond belief . we have been living in montville for N years and always been going to chand palace amiya in the neighborhood . spice grill was the only indian restaurant we were staying away from due to friends ' comments . as we are moving to a different city in jersey , thought of trying it once as it is somehow always full . as soon as we entered , the waiter turned his face away ( to avoid greeting and to show he doesn ' t care about the clients and he is frustrated of his job ! ) . we chose the table ourselves and nobody comes for N min to take our order or ask us if we are ready ( normal in all restaurants ) . as soon as we tell him that we have a groupon , he makes a face and dissapears for N min after taking the order . anyways , food comes in . we ordered simple veg manchurian , hakka noodles , kadhai paneer , naans etc . everything was so pathetic and bad that i hardly could believe i was eating in jersey . stay away ! ! ! go to chand palace amiya and get the worth for your money ( just that chand palace is veg ) 
i love fancy burgers . garce ' s simple N burger is something you will crave and want to come back for . the crispy brioche bun and the thick patty makes me salivate when thinking about it . duck fat fries were pretty good but did not surprise me . cheddar dip tastes great , but it was drippy and a little messy . lastly , i didn ' t like the other groups diners around me . some were very loud and blatantly talking about strangers around them , like they thought they were better than the people around them . weird . just didn ' t expect the restaurant to attract these type of people . 
i want to like roberta ' s , i do , i do . so many of my friends love this place and i have been there four times , once for brunch and the other times for dinner . the combination of the concept of using fresh grown vegetables , ethical produce and melting cheese onto dough really should mean that i love the food here . . . . but i don ' t . i ' ve tried the pizza with kale ( which kind of tasted like chinese restaurant seaweed on pizza . . . really bizarre ) and sausage , i ' ve tried the one with talleggio and sausage , the one with speck and garlic , the margherita , the eggs . . . . heck , i tried the wings . the food is fine . a bit bland . the toppings are very undergenerous . the servers need to get their shit together ! i have been working in the service industry for N years and there is absolutely no excuse for how rude these guys are ! there is one guy who is really nice , but the girls are offhand , unattentive and it always feels like you are putting them out or wasting their time . it ' s very strange . anyway . roberta ' s . it ' s fine . the price point is reasonable for what you are getting . i ' ll probably go again . 
ugh . . . mexican restaurants in new york continue to disappoint me . i came here with a whole lotta expectations and a very hungry tummy . after waiting for about N mins on a weeknight , we got seated at the bar . obviously we had to order the grilled corn . . . and it was as delicious as they say . probably the best corn i ' ve ever had ! but then , i got the tilapia tacos . . . which is where the disappointment began . pretty bland , tastless , and overstuffed . the rice and beans had too much salt as well . my dinner buddy ordered the vegetarian tacos . . . and it was the worst tasting , foul smelling piece of taco i ' ve ever had . it had uncooked okra in it . . . which gave it a horrible texture as well as taste . a restaurant can ' t just ride on the success of one appetizer . unless they add some zing to their insipid entrees , i ' m probably never coming back . 
amazing . had the mushroom gravy smothered chicken southern biscuit sandwich and the regional flight of beer -- it was incredible . the prices were reasonable , especially considering the one sandwich can definitely feed two very hungry people ( or you can have leftovers ) . more importantly , did i mention the biscuit sandwich was incredible ? ? i ' m dying for more . also , i too ( like other reviewers ) am someone who hates pickles , but nonetheless love jacob ' s pickles . definitely do not be discouraged by the mention of " pickles " in the restaurant ' s name . 
great food . . . fresh and local . great staff . . . friendly and local great customers . . . local
so far so good for this place , and i think american flatbread has a true competitor in town now . pizzeria verita is pushing out true italian deliciousness and topping the pies with obviously fresh ingredients . the pizza alla nutella is for me the most unique item on the menu . seeing as i can ' t eat sugar my girlfriend ordered one and raved about how it is the best pizza she has ever had . after that i had to try , and she was right it is pretty amazing . for me the most stand out feature of this place is the drink menu . they brought in a consultant to help create their drink menu and i think this was a great decision . now they have some of the most inventive , well executed drinks in town . again there attention to detail and use of quality , fresh ingredients shines in there drinks . for your money i think the old fashion here is amazing . overall this place is doing great . everything is fresh and delicious and the service is polite and accommodating , this is a new must try in burlington . 
we arrived early and the beautiful background was red and by the time we left it changed to a yellowish green . the atmosphere was relaxing and beatifully done . we loved the background music of soft rock and movie trivia in the bathrooms . our waitress was extremely attentive to our every course . we enjoyed all of the small dishes but would highly recommend the edamame dumplings , lobster roll , crab on rice cracker and ice cream cones for dessert . definitely go here with someone who enjoys sharing ! ! you will have a great time at this cozy , well priced , fantastic establishment . i highly recommend for N or for a group ! 
very impressed with the food here . dropped by for lunch with a friend and was completely surprised . good food , great prices , and good customer service . i ' m a big eater , so seconds were needed ( the portion size is enough to feed a waistline conscious person ) . will return again . love the naan and aloo ghobi . 
excellent , great location in old philly . melissa and angela know how to pick a restaurant ! shrimp rolls , pork dumplings both good selections . miso cod , pad thai , soft shell crab with curried cauliflower and chinese eggplant all excellent . service , atmosphere was off the hook ! 
unfortunately merriam-webster does not provide an antonym for " hospitality " . so for lack of a better expression , let me start by saying flat top is the epitome of whatever is the opposite of hospitality . over the weekend , during the badly rainy hours , the hosts waiters of this place would not let us sit and wait for the half hour by which time their kitchen would ' ve opened . don ' t misunderstand the dining room was all set up , the waiters were there , we would have been fine just sitting there and drinking something ( which is also extra cash , o smart ones , but you know better . . . ) , but no . sadly , my wife once ate here something she liked , so i was asked to come back here on a handful of occasions . the waiters waitresses are always rude . one example is not even letting me sit down waiting for N person . so party of N . tables open , once again i would ' ve sat with a drink and the menu to wait , but no . you might think that all this treatment is worth it for the kitchen . but the food is nothing i cannot make at home , and at that it ' s far overpriced . salads at N ? when i asked whether a salad with tuna came with fresh tuna , they told me it did , but guess what it was your good old tuna salad from the corner deli . tuna freshly out of a can . to top it all off , the last time i did manage toget food here , i was so tired of waiting that i turned on a stopwatch . food came a full N minutes after sitting down . very disappointed with this place and there is no chance that i ' ll ever go back . 
the pizza is average . there is nothing remarkable about it . it is fresh but not exceptional . the restaurant is big , noisy and a N hour wait for seating . you can ' t take a pizza that you purchased from them as a pick-up and sit in their outside space to eat it . if you are in the neighborhood and it is convenient to go there it makes sense to try it . but i would not go out of my way . 
worst viennese restaurant in the world . soggy wiener schnitzel . batter fried in oil tasting of fish . meat , if it was veal , not pounded thin . sachertorte insults hotel sacher . mixed salad insipid . coffee like dishwater . 
went to the all you can eat buffet at mesob yesterday - it only happens once a year , on the ethiopian new year . everything was so fresh and delicious - N different dishes , vegan and meat , hot and cold , mild and spicy . the house dressing on the mixed green salad ( ye ' mesob selata ) was excellent - just the right blending of seasonings . it enhanced the taste without smothering it . and i loved those crisps of spiced injera on top ! the buticha ( pureed chick peas with spices ) was a textural treat . the little descriptive signs next to each serving dish were so helpful . it gave me a great idea for my holiday party this year - i found out that mesob caters ! ! 
please out of towners , don ' t waste your limited time and meals here . the pizza is mediocre . whole foods is better . seriously . 
i have mixed feelings about the smith . i have generally never had to wait more than N minutes for a table ( even with a group of N ) . the mixed drinks are spectacular . the melted blue cheese over the homemade potato chips are delicious and enough to feed the table . the gnocchi was the best i ' ve ever tasted . the burgers aren ' t unbelievable , but good . the spaghetti is decent . the food tastes good and comes in big portions , if a bit overpriced . it gets really loud in here , especially on the weekends . if you ' re looking for a quiet place to enjoy your meal with friends , the smith may not be the best choice . also , i love the photobooth downstairs and the nice clean bathrooms in the basement . 
treated myself to some good ol ' soul food chicken and waffles . waffle and chicken were both crispy and flavorful . the service was a little off . i had N different waiters for no reason . it would have been awesome if they weren ' t both so slow and confused . 
barbara ' s hungarian goes above and beyond hospitality at the highest standard without a hint of pretentiousness . barbara herself has nurtured me during N pregnancies ( i am an american stranger ! ) she made me feel like i was related to her- serving me amazing dishes ( no charge ) and marveling at my miracle of life . the food is so comforting and spot on that u want to curl up in bed asap . barbara is a capable food service provider , but what ' s more , is that she touches ur humanity with a warm smile and a tenacity to please every one of her guests . go in there and feel the hard work and the love despite the language barrier . . . . a beautiful family who creates outstanding dishes . . . 
this place has tremendously horrible service . i ' ve ordered from here a few times and every time they mess up my order or are extremely late on delivering . i ordered from here and after waiting almost N hours i called back for the Nrd time and they tried blaming me on giving the wrong number . like me , never order from here . awful . 
i like this place after a long night out at the club . food is very tasty . i like this place vs . penang . both penang and banana leaf share the same menu . yum . . . banana leaf chicken wing and indian pancake was made to profection . 
by far the best breakfast i ' ve had anywhere , bar none . the place is tiny and unless you ' re there early , there will be a wait . service is outstanding . delicious coffee , giant cups ( bowls ) of hot chocolate . their food is original and innovative . if shrimp and grits happens to be on the menu , try it . served in a mini cast iron skillet with chorizo , an ethereal biscuit on the side . you will not be disappointed ! 
for a place that is all about mac n cheese and grill cheese the are totally lacking in both . . . . the grill cheeses we ordered should be over flowing with cheese . the napa chicken grill cheese they used dark meat ! it was gross . . . our mac n cheese was so peppery and dry . it was like someone accidentally dumped a container on peeper in it and just decided to leave it . i would say buy kraft singles and white bread and make your own sandwiches . you would save money and your taste buds . soooo disappointing
the food is great , real authentic taiwanese food . i love their noodles , especially wide noodle . beef noodle soup ( clear broth ) , noodle with ground pork N beans paste sauce , and chinese style fried chicken noodle rice are good . they also have pan fried beef bun pan fried pork dumpling which is hardly to eat in any other restaurants in nj . i usually order some small dishes , such as seaweed , shredded bean curd , sliced port ears , . . . . etc to come with my main courses . i also love their deserts , sweet red bean congee bubble tea , which i highly recommend . from my experience , i went to the restaurant two-three times per week , and i can easily get a place to sit during weekday lunch hours , but in the weekend , i have to wait . the good thing is that i can make the reservation for the party over N people . overall , it is a nice restaurant with great food at decent price . 
so here is the deal with hoagie haven . if you grew up in princeton and no , i do not mean you just went to school here for four short years , you understand that hoagie haven is nothing glamorous . it is not a " gourmet " sub shop , nor does it claim to be . if you are coming here expecting a perfectly manicured , pristine sandwich to be handed to you on a silver platter with cloth napkins , it ain ' t gonna happen . hoagie haven is the place to go for fast , cheap , greasy , and tasty food . anything you get there will be delicious and filling . once you go here a few times , you ' ll be hooked , and other sandwich places just won ' t do it anymore . 
best pizza ever ! ! ! but need to eat while it ' s hot . 
great atmosphere , cool food , good beer . this is the place to hear some good live music and is quickly making fishtown a happening place to be ! 
i haven ' t had any food here ( yet ) , but the specials sound great . the bar service was wonderful . . . the entire staff is really friendly . i admit , one night i had one too many shots of tequila . . . and the next time i was there , they just laughed it off and pointed out that i at least had a good time ! also , you can ' t beat the fact that you can see live bands in the back , and happy hour prices are awesome ( N N price drafts ) . 
the crepes were pre-made and not as fresh as it could be . it was average pricing and the store decorations were cute but that ' s all
this place makes me just about as happy as a restaurant can . i am guilty of trying to find just about any reason to drag friends , family , aquaintences etc . in there . if you get a nice seat in the bar , be prepared to hang out a bit . its not a wise choice for a quick bite . . . but its a nice place to be left alone to enjoy . the atmosphere is par for the course in an nicer mexican restaurant . you can go in jeans and a t-shirt with friends that superglue their hair . . . or dress it up and bit and go with your mom . . . and still not feel out of place . its such a versatile restaurant . the margaritas are what captured my heart . prickley pear , blood orange , raspberry , tangerine etc . or the basic lime . . . they ' re as good as margaritas get . and you can get them in pitchers too . . . which spells trouble in the best possible way . they give you chips and N kinds of salsa to munch on . at first look , the salsa appears to be a bust , but upon closer investigation , the salsa verde is the perfect blend of spicy and zippy . i could eat it with a spoon- forget the chips ! then comes the food- the nachos will change your life . i ' m a vegetarian , and the faux-beef option is genius . they ' re delicious . if i split these with a friend , i tend to be down for the count . . . but when i skip the nachos , i heart the seitan and tofu fajitas . they ' ll feed you at least twice . this place is where its at . i ' m so proud that its so close to home ! 
it is a hidden gem . the menu is healthy - lots of gluten free and vegetarian entrees . the service is courteous and friendly and make you feel welcome . i like that feeling . i strongly recommend coming here , at least one and checking it out . we had a nice friendly waiter who saw us looking at the menu and welcome us in . 
in which country is this thai food ? menu was limited and confusing . only N curry dishes . tried one and not only was it the saltiest dish i ' ve ever had , but not even close to thai . not even sure if curry was used . i ' d never go back . 
i ' m giving them N stars because the only issue we had was so small , and i am certain it had to do with the newness of the staff , who have , i am sure , become adept at everything . we tried the writing room one day for brunch . we are big fans of the parlor which is operated by the same people and thought , let ' s give it a go . now , i don ' t know how many yelp readers , if any , ever had a chance to dine at elaines , which is the former tenant . obviously the reputation for elaines preceded it and i really felt that people ( at the end of elaines days in business ) went there for the ambiance , not necessarily the cuisine . i am happy to report that the writing room has kept an air of that " elaine ' s-esque " era and amplified it by leaps and bounds with its sharp d cor . sure , you still can find pics of truman capote on the wall amongst many other notable scribes and performers , but it is a modern , clean , more updated feel . so on ambiance it gets an " a " we were N for brunch , which has been known more than once to overwhelm the less confident server , which was not our experience at all at the writing room . due to our large number we made a reservation . immediately upon arrival we were shown to our table . took a blink or three before anyone came over and asked about our desire for beverages ( that ' d be the only issue , which i ' m sure has been overcome ) we had a mixed bag of a crew so there were a couple bloody mary ' s as well as lots of sparkling water . the bloody marys were great . spicy , great garnish and really hit the spot . as it was our first visit we ordered an assortment of appetizers , who am i kidding ? we ordered one of every appetizer ! everything was great . the entree ' s came out hot and were cooked to perfection we tried everything from the chicken salad to the salmon to the pancakes , and all items were a smashing success . i would highly recommend the writing room , and look forward to our next visit ! with love , the ues critic ! xxx
i used to have to go out to manhattan for this type of food , but no more ! i love everything on their menu . it ' s affordable and so tasty . i love the fact that there are two locations too . 
casa mono is mario batali ' s tapas restaurant in gramercy . it is a tiny restaurant , and i do mean tiny . i think there are maybe N N-person tables , plus whatever you can fit at the bar ( maybe another N people ) . my sister , brother-in-law , and i were sat at a table meant for N , and we ' re all tall ( Nft-ish ) . i don ' t really mind being squished at a table , but it is kinda annoying to be bumped into constantly . interestingly enough , and i did not know this at the time i was dining , casa mono has a single michelin star . i say interesting , because i feel babbo is superior , and does not have any michelin rating . it was not difficult to get a reservation , once i gave up the thought of eating at a normal time . tried for months to get an N o ' clock resi on a friday or saturday , with no luck . but on the friday before , we were able to get a N N resi on a saturday no problem ! our waitress suggested N - N plates per person , which is pretty standard for tapas , and that ' s what we went with . we ordered house-made pork charcuterie , spanish cheese , seasonal pickles pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas razor clams a la plancha squid ink bomba rice with taylor bay scallops fideos with chorizo and clams quail with tomato raisens and baby romaine pulpo with fennel and grapefruit confit goat with creamed kale and pepitas crema catalana con bu uelos if you ' re not familiar , fideos are about N " sections of angel hair pasta , toasted and cooked . along with the chorizo and clams , i think it was my favorite dish of the night . the squid ink bomba rice and razor clams close out the top three . careful , the razor clams are heavy on garlic . the pulpo and quail ( N of our main proteins of the meal ) we ' re good , but not as great as some of the smaller earlier courses . the fried bay leaves that came with the crema catalana were my favorite part of dessert ! the wine selection is pretty nice , and as thom h points out , it is a bit on the expensive side - but not prohibitively so . i started with a glass of agusti torello mata cava , which was delicious , and then we shared a bottle of catalunya wine picked at random that was pretty good , a bit on the lighter and sweeter than i would have thought , but again - it was picked at random . my spanish pronunciation is better than italian and french , but my wine knowledge is far from par . the service was decent , a bit lacking in my opinion for a N michelin star restaurant . but the waitress and the entire staff were friendly , and obviously well versed in working in such a tiny environment . logistically , thinks ran very smoothly . price - most plates are in the N - N range , which is slightly on the expensive side of the norm , but well worth it in my opinion . to be honest , i think the comfort level is a reason i won ' t rush back . the food was amazing , but it ' s the type of food you want to go and eat with a big group of friends , order more as you go , have another bottle of wine towards the end of the meal - and that type of experience really isn ' t possible at casa mono . once done , they will bring you next door to bar jamon if you would like more to drink , which will be even louder and more crowded than casa mono . i associate a more relaxed and european experience with tapas restaurants , and you won ' t get that at casa mono . but , the food does speak volumes , and it ' s worth going at least once . 
when seeing that i brought a group of N people to this place , the manager said this is bad because " people outside will think the bar is crowded and not want to come in " . yes , those are quotes i ' m using . wow ! besides the odd management techniques , seems like a pretty nice place . great beer selection ! N taps of quality stuff you don ' t see enough of . food looked good but didn ' t stay long enough find out for sure . go here if you want to look sharp and talk about how obnoxious the people at bar nine are . go to bar bar nine if you want to actually have fun and talk about how douchey the people at brickyard are . the service is holding this place back ! 
has my mouth watering ! 
good but expensive food . they have a wide variety of choices . it ' s usually pretty crowded and service suffers . i have been there for breakfast and lunch and would recommend breakfast . the lunch crowd is very loud and service is poor . the lunch menu is also diverse but not in a good way . breakfast is reasonably priced and you can hear the music rather than the people around you . the decor is amazing and at both meals we were given a small plate of complementary appetizers . on the plus side , best cheesecake in the world but save yourself some time and patience , go to the bakery next door . 
the good the food ! good lord this place is legit . for N it cannot be beat . who knows what the hell is in the white sauce but it ' s damn amazing . urban folklore has it that the sauce is made by culinary angels and delivered to earth on soft white clouds . i hit this place up regularly and don ' t think twice about making the trek all the way from harlem . do it . the bad the wait , but i get it , it ' s great food . the ugly absolutely nothing . 
such a dissapointment . the pizzas look delicious but taste mediocre . the sicilian slice was super salty . the spinach artichoke pizza was , dare i say , bland and definitely not as unctuous or decadent as i was anticipating . the long wait is artificially created . there are lines at this place because the service is super slow , not because they are getting so many orders of whole pies . if you pay attention , the people at the cashier are joking around and dilly dallying half the time even though they have a few pies lying around that are ready for sale . i ' m really not sure what the fuss is about pizza here . now that i ' ve experienced it myself , i ' m definitely not going back . 
very nice place ! clean , cozy , and comfortable ! the fried chicken is better than colonel sanders and the papa ziti is a favorite of mine ! i have yet to have something here that sucks ! the staff is awesome and very professional . a great place to have a late night bite . i work late and whenever i show up they always welcome you at the door with menus in hand and a smile ! ! ! please , note that the chicken takes N minutes but it is worth it ! ! ! by the way , their breakfast really fills you up and the prices are great . enjoy ! 
love it ! really tasty food , very reasonably priced . the service is friendly and fast . i always get the crab cake appetizer and the vegetable pho . i live two blocks away and this is my vietnamese go to spot ! 
been here many times and the tapas do not disappoint . the staff are very knowledgeable so if you are not sure or if it ' s your first introduction to spanish tapas , just ask ! you can shop and eat here , so it ' s a convenient place for all food stuff from spain . a great place . 
what a gem of a place . the antipasto was out of this world . la boca is the best dining experience on north ave . 
oh cafe habana . when i dream of cuban food , i dream of cafe habana . this place was the place when i lived here . i would wait in line for however long it took for a bite of its corn , chilaquiles , huevos rancheros . i also wouldn ' t overlook the iced coffee because it is delicioso ! during my last visit , i ordered the huevos ranchers and substituted the home fries for yellow rice . i also ordered the sweet plantains on the side . the sauce wasn ' t as spicy as i ' ve had in the past , which i liked . i love this place , love it , love it , love it . 
i ' m a huge top chef fan . . . and was amazed by the food that was put out on friday night . the restaurant was packed , and we didn ' t even wait long for our table . i was a bit in awe in seeing harold in person . . . it must be that celebrity-ism that he now carries . as for the dining experience . . . . N stars . an unlikely thing that i will give unless i was truly amazed . and friday night , my gf and i were amazed . we started off the night with a glass of pinot noir . . . ordered two apps . . . the duck meatballs were fantastic ! a very nice treat , that gave a nice little kick in the back of my mouth due to its heat . we also had the sea diver scallops . . . but i think what made it interesting was the pairing of the blood oranges . overall , a well cooked starter . the entree , was a toss up . . . meaning , we couldn ' t decide what to get . i knew that i was going for the duckling . . . but i also had the tuna in mind . . . then again , the gf opted for the tuna special . . . so of course , it made it a whole lot easier to order . we also threw in a side of the faro risotto . we ordered the duck , mr , and the tuna , rare . both came out to our delight as it sure as hell looks like harold is manning the pass to perfection . dessert . . . we got the doughnuts . . . a nice sweet treat . and the chocolate tart . . . which was good . . . and not overwhelming . i highly recommend perilla . . . as i plan on returning with a few friends for some really good food . 
not so bad . . . 
i have been going here for years , and it never disappoints . noodles are made to order , and the soup tastes great . . . the dumplings are to die for . . just be make sure you carry gum with you because your breath will stink after eating the dumplings , but it ' s definitely worth it ! 
best and most authentic banh mi in nyc . the place is very tiny - can only seat up to N people . so i would suggest not coming in big groups unless you ' re planning on getting your sandwich to go . haven ' t tried their other food but will always come back just for the banh mi alone . 
granted yes , this isn ' t a gourmet burger you ' d get at a fancy steak house , but it is full of flavor . i ' ve been here multiple times , and even once or twice not at Nam getting out of a long night of drinking . the burgers are always very moist and the limited topping ( the works being tomatoes , lettuce , and onions ) give you the true taste of the burger without all the frilly toppings . and other than mamoon ' s this is one of the only good places open late in this town ! 
i like going to this spot , however i was there a few nights ago with a group of friends and there was an asian waitress who was rude as hell . she had a very nasty attitude and kept telling people to stay out of her way because she needed the space to work . its a bar not a restaurant or hall , people are going to be standing and talking . ive been a waiter myself and as a waiter you need to politely ask people to move and kind of find your way around the crowd , don ' t like it ? then don ' t wait on tables , simple . 
total fan ! i discovered this place at smorgasburg over the summer and i said to ma-sef . sef ? we need to get busy with some more of that bbq ! we walk in on this beautiful fall day . mighty quinn ' s makes it easy for the customer . there is a sign that says order here then you choose a sandwich or price per pound meat order your sides order your beers on tap sodas then . . get er dun ! my wife and i both had the brisket sandwich and my son ordered the pulled pork . there are free items like two types of cole slaw ? ? my wife , for whatever reason is a mayonnaise hater . mq offers two types of slaw , with or without mayo . nice mq , nice pickled onions , pickled celery , pickled cucumber and picked jalape os . i chose them all ! then , ( here ' s the great part ) the best baked beans i ever ate . the beans were different kinds of beans and sizes . they also weren ' t overpowering which is nice . not too smokey and the sauce was also nice and not too thick . the sweet potatoes were good , nothing outstanding to report oh yeah , my son orders the pomme frites french fries ! the best in nyc is being served here . we also ordered two of their pumpkin ice cream cookie sandwich . throw in a ipa on tap and my sons soda ? total price was N bucks great bbq , there are other items i ' d like to try like the beef rib ! i ' m a fan and i ' ll be back
i was here on a friday night . the service is great ! ! if you ' re in the mood for a cool tavern atmosphere . . . this is the place . i ordered a hamburger with country fries . it was the best burger i ever had ! ask for the malt vinegar to add of the fries . to drink , the mulled wine is a perfect winter treat . this might be a weekly spot ! 
one of my favorites ! lovely bakery ! ! 
i have visited revolution kitchen many times and i have to say this place is one of the few places in burlington that uses all local and organic ingredients in their food . the owners have many years of restaurant experience . they know how to treat there guests . i recently went in and tried the falafel chick pea burger wrap and it was incredible ! the owners personal greeted me and explained how and where they get their food . this is so rare to find . while at the bar i met so many other locally like minded people who just want a healthy place to go and eat . while at the bar i met several people in the local food industry including a local man who forages wild mushrooms and all different types of food . what a great experience . i will definitely be back ! ! joanna
was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and the service the server paid just the right amount of attention to us . the fact that i am a vegetarian normally makes things a little more uncertain- here the server was helpful and the meal i had was excellent . the dessert although i did not need it after such a good meal was just as good . fried cheese cake with a blueberry compote - but the frying was light and crisp and very tasty . i am sorry this restaurant is not neare r to where i live or i would be ther frequently
great food , nice people , it was not expensive and the place was clean . great choice for an informal place with great indian food . it is not a pretty restaurant but it is very good
consistently good and light thai food . service is also very friendly . i know that gaw gai in court square is owned by the same folks but the food really is very different and we much prefer tuk tuk . 
when i was a kid my mom told me not to overfeed my goldfish because they would just eat and eat and eat until they died . i always thought my goldfish were pretty stupid if that were truly the case . then again , it could be that tetra-min fish food is the pescian equivalent of meatball sandwiches for me . anyway , this place opened up two blocks from my apartment and i ' m in serious trouble . i went with a classic combo- beef meatballs , tomato sauce , and provolone . i ' m a firm believer that you must master the classics and standards before getting too fancy . these guys did that . looking forward to mixing it up with some of their other combos . prices reasonable , service very good . 
i went with a reservation for two at Npm on a tuesday . we could have easily gotten a table if we just walked in . we both got the two plates and dessert meal . we were expecting quality , but somewhat meager portions . fortunately , we were wrong on the latter and not the former . rice cracker crusted tuna - perfectly cooked with an interesting and flavorful spicy mayo . fried chicken - seemed like a deboned thigh then rolled up . a tiny bit dry near the end piece , but overall moist and crisp on the outside . accompanying mushroom spaetzle was great . cod with miso yuzu glaze - a great light fish dish with lots of flavor and simply dressed baby bok choy . char-grilled cheeseburger - my friend had this and said it was definitely one of the better burgers he ' s ever had . and i know he ' s had a lot . it came with very good fries . warm valrhona chocolate cake - served with vanilla ice cream . very rich , very good . i went with high expectations and was definitely impressed overall . it was a fine dining experience without the rigmarole and price usually associated with fine dining . looking forward to going there again . 
i have always used yelp to find restaurants but never took the time to review any . . . . . until now . this place is great . i was looking for a romantic restaurant to take my boyfriend to for his birthday and stumbled on this gem . i had an amazing experience here . the ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic and intimate . you can sit at the back in the garden or in the basement where they have a live jazz band . from the moment you walk into this place you are greeted with great service . we had a waitress that was very attentive and very patient in explaining the menu . there are a lot of options and it can be a bit overwhelming for someone who isn ' t familiar with italian food but everything i had was great , my boyfriend loved his food too and he is very picky . i have been to a lot of restaurants in nyc and this is one of the best so far . great service and great food . . . . worth every penny . 
best pizza ever . i read some other reviews and how people thought the pizza was a bit on the limp side . i have noticed but that ' s how i like my pizza . i love the crust and sauce . it has a nice oomph to it since i can taste a bit of the tartness and saltiness a great combo . i wished we tried the various pastas but i was focused on just their pizzas . i ' ll try the other dishes next time and there will definitely be a next time . 
probably the greatest deli on earth . i ' ve tried everything on the menu about N times . the people are awesome but the cheesesteaks are the hook . get fried onions and mushrooms on it . ask for the chicken wings with their homemade buffalo sauce incredible ! they have daily lunch specials that very from day to day that the chef congers up . they have quality products . love them ! 
used to work here but it has gone dramatically downhill . 
my wife ordered in from here last weekend . a ) the person who wrote the portions are small probably weighs around N . the portions are generous and adequate comparable to the recommended serving size by the food and drug administration . i know most people who eat soul don ' t get that , but at this place you can have some soul food not be full for the next five days . b ) the mac cheese is exceptional . c ) the prices in my opinion could be higher and still be fine . we luv it ! ! 
the sake oyako don ( salmon sashimi and roe over rice ) is really great here and very artistically presented . i love how the salmon roe would burst in my mouth with flavor . i also enjoyed the agedashi tofu . we had some crab dish over rice , which i think might have been a special . it was delicious ! what really stood out here were the desserts . the chocolate souffle was outstanding and perfectly moist . my sister really loved the black sesame creme brulee . even if you ' re full , definitely order the desserts here ! 
best burger in town . . . i usually order the burger with out adding anything because it is so good just the way it is . the flavor is outstanding , and it is always perfectly cooked . the other great thing about this place is the bar and it is fun to watch the bartender mix . i would definitely suggest planning ahead because it is hard to get a table , but if you don ' t mind sitting at the bar the wait is short . 
cookshop came highly recommended by a trusted source , whose credibility went up several notches after my dinner here . the restaurant seemed hip , but still off the beaten path . ted danson casually waltzed in and barely caused a stir with the staff or patrons . we came without a reservation and managed to snag a table fairly quickly - i admit we were pretty early for dinner though . i tried the rabbit - yes , i know , how could i eat such a cute animal . . . blah , blah - but i wanted to try something different . it tasted great . . . full of flavor , tender , moist - very similar to chicken just slighly chewier . the waiter was extremely helpful and recommended a great wine to pair with my dinner . 
slow . slow . slow . and i swear the N times i was in somehow i ended up with some sort of unknown meat on my vegetarian falafel . wtf ? ! ? its sucks when you either have to pick apart your meal to make it edible , or throw it out . never had the pizza , but it looked ok . 
fantastic meal . i recommend the kale and mushroom paella -- amazing -- and the lorenzo cocktail . the room itself is just beautiful with a great vibe -- warm and not pretentious the same with the service which was friendly and attentive . will definitely go back often . 
i have been going to this restaurant since i moved to astoria back in N . the food is delicious . the staff are the best . vinnie is a host there , and he will assist you with anything you need . rocca is the owner chef and what a chef ! the food is delicious , and his hospitality is superb . rocco comes out and talks with his costumers , and is just super friendly . they once gave me a bottle of wine because i was such a good costumer . love this place . 
i came very late in the night , and while service was quick and efficient ( and the sushi was beautifully presented ) , i ' m not sure that i got the freshest fish . nice decor for a strip mall . roe was good ( isn ' t it always ? ) . 
i have been somewhat disappointed the last few visits . i was once a weekly customer . the other day i got a waffle . the staff handed it to me as soon as it appeared on the counter yet it couldn ' t even melt the butter . also , the centered was undercooked and mushy . no sense complaining as there just a few kids working and they had long lines . 
great restaurant in the theater district . . . not too expensive . we had a great time during mothers ' day weekend . great portions , family style with the right environment for a family . we had a N-hour lunch on mothers ' day . . . everyone was happy and we packed the leftovers . 
i can confidently say that this restaurant is one of my favorite places for sushi . i have been here many times and it ' s always been an exceptionally pleasant experience . the food has always been really good and the atmosphere is amazing . it ' s relaxing and moderately quiet , and you can really enjoy yourself at night here as well . the service was always great and there was nothing to really complain about . this place has some sushi options that are not offered in other sushi places , which i like . overall , this is much better of a place for shushi around the area than other restaurants . 
i was strolling around for a baby shower venue with my best friend . we drove through bloomfield , and i always wanted check out bar cara , ( which i never tried ) . i walked in and it ' s yellow plum . the atmosphere was cute , chic , yet simple and elegant . the art work on the wall is colorful yet not overwhelming . it definitely brings out the place . it ' s good for a romantic date , drinks with your honey , or girls night out for cocktails . the hostess was very welcoming and helpful . we were introduced to the owner and he introduced the catering packages . he was very informative and particular about every aspect of the menu down to how drinks were made , what ingredients were used in the cocktails and food menu , and how many ounces per drink . he had a confidence about his place that went beyond a sales pitch . he answered many of the questions we did not have to ask . he was very flexible regarding menu choices , and they even will allow a taste testing once venue and menu is selected . i appreciate that the catering menu did not differ from their menu , but they will work with you . i hope we all agree on this place . afterwards , i decided to grab drinks and try an appetizer . wow ! the mac cheese with to short ribs is heaven for a true foodie . if a place can spice up a dish like that , i ' m sold . it had a comfort food eclectic fine dining flair . the other items on the menu were enticing . i appreciate the detail in each dish on the menu . yes , the meals are on the high side , but a true foodie wouldn ' t be able to resist testing out the creatively described choices . after tasting the appetizer , i am willing to test out the entrees for the cost . trust me , who wouldn ' t be curious about oxtail ravioli ! ! next on my list ! ! ! the bartenders made excellent suggestions regarding the appetizer and cocktails . the red angel is a delicious and refreshing drink . they were even able to make a virgin one for my expecting friend , and it was just as good . i love a creative and well thought out menu . i could not have been more pleased , and the friendliness , helpfulness , and welcoming nature from the entire staff was a bonus . they were beyond accommodating . i sensed that they were still learning , and i appreciated the great display of team work helping one another to get questions answers for inquiring consumers . nothing is worst than witnessing coworkers snapping on one another or growing annoyed with customers because one or none knows the answer . this didn ' t happen here . i hope this place keeps up the great work , as they have found a new customer . i can ' t wait to try the happy hour ! ! 
excellent food in a wonderful setting . what more could you ask for ! 
eat like a queen king ! super sized amazing italian entrees ! i loved every bite licked and scrapped the tomato sauce with my bread the whole night ! ! ! me and N others ate like royalty ! we ordered N appetizers ! i loved the bruschetta so much the ripe red tomatoes were tasty . the grilled shrimp was so good i wanted to lick the whole plate . oh ! ! ! then the giant meatballs ! ! soft , savory and spicy ! the best italian sauce ever ! ! then we got N huge main dishes ! loved the sausage with grilled red bell peppers . heaven in my mouth ! my taste buds where on esteroids ! ! also loved the penne with vodka . then we saw the dessert ! ! decadence came as a giant browny with two layers of ice cream basically a napolitano huge cake ! ! ! i licked my spoon ! ! ! family style dining , crowded place but lively like an italian party . since we shared the meals i was out if there paying N bucks that ' s including the tip ! ! i was skeptical to go here since it ' s near times square and tourist are the most boring people to be around . also the prices are usually outrageous near that area but believe me the food was amazing ! i want to go again this week ! ! yuuuuummmm ! ! i will definitely go back and bring friends ! 
my family and i went to a midweek dinner and were very disappointed . although not busy the waiter ignored us most of the time and started to argue when my mom found her salmon dish burnt . aparently their salmon comes with a black crust . in addition we were charged for every soda refill and no one ever even apologiezed for the slow service or burnt items . all in all we felt very uncomfortable and will never return . 
if you like butter , this is your place . if you like bacon , traif is it . this reasonably priced southern french crepes were buttercentricly delicious ! shrimp curry cr pe and mussel and spinach cr pes were very nice . the curry cr pe had just a hint of curry flavor and didn ' t overpowered a well balanced cr pe . the not so fresh mussels weren covered with butter and made good . unsuccessful cr pes that night was savoyarde ( potatoes , camembert , bacon and onion ) , camembert wasn ' t well melted yet and felt too greasy with cheese and butter . i would like to have a just a slash of lemon juice over it to cut the greasiness to enhanced the crepe but if you can drink alcohol , those dishes would wonderfully work with a glass of rich red wine . what i loved the most was socca ( chickpeas pancake ) from the appetizer . we had a plate of different appetizers ( provencale plate ) and socca shined the most , a touch of salt on it was very nice . it was like a pancake comes with malaysian roti canai . next was pissaladiere , finger cut small pizza were not like typical pizza but foccacia with topping with a sweet onion and anchovies . least favorite was black olive tapenade . it was too salty but worked well with a garlic toast that came with . for non-drinker table like ours , everything was way too heavy or some too salty and we could not go for yummy looking dessert cr pes after . i must come back just for dessert cr pe soon ! 
i do not understand . my friend has telled me about this place so we go one day , all of us . now i understand that in ukraine we do not have pizza ' s but i eat many a pizza since moving to brooklyn and this one was nothing special . we all stand in line for hour or two , suffering in cold as smelling come from all over us . i must admit , it was good smelling . i was excited almost to the point of sexual . finally we get to front of line and we make order for a whole pizza . waiting a while , we finally get pizza . our mouth ' s watering with delight , we each take a slice . was like eating totino ' s pizza roll . i was unimpressed by this pizza . cheese was like goat ' s cheese that turn sour and red meat on tops was spicy and greasey . how dare they sell such things for human consumption . i will only buy again as laxative , for this . . . it does job well . 
you have to go here . miya ' s is the best of the best . if you have any sense of adventure and style , go to miya ' s . it can be a bit pricey but it is most certainly well worth it . everything tastes phenomenal . in regards to their seven deadly sins dessert roll - i ' ve always said , " it ' s like an amusement park for your mouth . " 
this place falls under the category " tired and old philadelphia institution that needs to just go " yes a lengthy title but this place is seriously old and tired . i only go here because i am forced to go here but the food and the service . . . well to be honest - it just is not that great anymore . once upon a time in a galaxy far far away it was a decent place but now ? seems like the just like taking your money and that is about it . . . 
food was delicious ! the servers were friendly and executed wonderful service ! there ' s no reservation , it ' s first come , first served and there is always a line outside ! ! i ordered the reggie harris which is honey dipped fried chicken with two sides of my choice and i chose collard greens and fried okra ! best finga lickin chicken ! the music in the background was old school r b which gave the restaurant such a mellow , throwback kind of environment . i will come here again ) just don ' t want to wait in any line . 
went here early last evening ( sunday ) on the advice of other yelpers . they were right about the mojitos--awesome ! ( too bad we weren ' t there for happy hour , but N isn ' t so bad ) . the good news is that sunday is N N price taquito nite . so that ' s what we ordered carne , pollo camarones . i didn ' t try the carne , but my husband scarfed them down . shrimp were the best , but all were good . nice atmosphere , pleasant , attentive service . def . recommended . 
been here a few times over the past couple of years . . . when visiting family who live a couple of blocks away . very friendly service , good food , great prices on food and drinks ! 
decent meal . nothing to rave about
pommes frites , as frites as the pommes go , as frites as the winds blow , pommes frites ! ok , if you ' re too young to remember the song " born free " or you have no idea who elsa the lion is , that intro makes no sense to you , so i ' ll make this review more simple and timely . best . fries . ever . 
i recently celebrated my birthday here . it was a larger party ( N people ) but the staff still had no problem accommodating us in every way possible . appetizers were preset and were on the table within ten minutes of taking our entree orders . we started with large orders of both the calamari and fresh figs . we also pre-ordered a few plates of the antipasto misto . after appetizers were cleared it was only a short wait before our entrees were brought to the table , all of which were plated beautifully and looked absolutely delicious . i myself , ordered the veal gremolada . all ingredients tasted extremely fresh and were well prepared . once everyone was finished the staff came around and wrapped any dishes that guests weren ' t able to finish . shortly after that , coffee and deserts were brought out . guests were able to choose from cappuccino , espresso , and regular coffee . but our desserts were preset ( cannolis , tiramisu , and cookies ) all of which were made on premises and were delicious . overall truely a N-star experience . service was outstanding as well as the food . definitely will be returning on multiple occasions . p . s . - portion sizes are very generous , dont worry about leaving hungry . 
if you are looking for a place for your wedding . stay away from this horrible place . the services were extremly horrible . the staff very unprofessional and laura is extremly rude . they totally screw up my wedding party . our package inclued hot and cold o ' dours , the provided enough cold o ' dours but only bought out N trays of hot o ' dours for my guests . we have asked them to make sure there are enough hot o ' dours for our guests prior to the wedding and laura ensure us there will be enough for everyone . this is a lie the waiters and waitress were not very well trained to handle wedding parties . i have put all of my guests meal request on the seating card , they did not look at the card at all . they bought the food out all at once and asked my guests to raised their hands if their food was called . some of guests waited almost Nminutes to get their food . they do not have assigned server to the table , so , there might be N people serving one table and some table has no one to serve them . the head waitress doesn ' t even speak english and she yelled at my guests . some of my guests told them they gave them the wrong order and their responses was " we ran out of steak so you have to eat the chicken " . the worst part was that the kids meal were never served ! ! ! ! my family had to bring their food over to the kids table . my family had to leave my wedding to bring the kids to somewhere else . i called laura and told her that i was very unhappy with the service , she didn ' t say sorry at all . she blamed my family was being rude . my vendors also complained the mill on the river was very difficult to work with . they didn ' t even also us to put up a projector for our slideshows . also , they have to charge my vendors N per ride to use the elevator . stay away from this place ! ! ! ! ! ! 
xcellend chicken curry soup , so spicy i have to water it down . 
i was very much looking forward to brunch at abc kitchen . the service was so poor it diminished our entire experience . our waitress disappeared after the initial " hello " and we had to engage several other wait staff to assist us . she was not able to tell us the specials without making errors , spoke so softly amidst the noise in the restaurant , she was inaudible . we saw her for our order and then never saw her again--water , coffee , ketchup , bread , dessert menu were all accomplished by us hailing down other gracious wait staff . the food was good but sadly , i ' ve had better service at tgi fridays ! ! ! ! ! not happy with the overall experience for a restaurant that has received rave reviews . . . therefore won ' t be going back anytime soon . 
my daughter and i sat at one of the two outdoor tables out front early on sunday morning because we had a puppy on a leash with us . i went inside to let the hostess know we were sitting there , and she informed us that we had to order takeout at the cashier and eat out of styrofoam containers . then the cashier told me that the food would take N minutes before it was ready . the restaurant was less than half full . the food is good but overpriced . there ' s no good reason why i should have to eat out of takeout containers and get no waitress service when there are only N tables outside . 
outstanding ! four of us ate there this past saturday night and it was tremendous . we were across the street having a drink while we waited for our table . they actually walked over to find us and tell us we were ready to be seated . who does that ? and trust me , there was a line of people waiting , they could have easily filled that table . and then the food , omg ! all the entree choices were delicious as were the appetizers , wine and dessert . we had it all . portion size is generous , and the prices are so very reasonable . and the staff was so friendly , even in the fast paced , busy setting , they maintained a great attitude and really made us feel welcomed and never rushed . i found this gem based on yelp reviews , trust me , you need to eat here . thanks to the staff for a great dining experience ! 
best burger there cheddar cheese , jalapeno peppers , chopped black olives and a-N steak sauce . add a chocolate heath bar milkshake to that , and a side of onion rings and fries with their horse radish dipping sauce . and you ' ve got the ultimate craving satifisfier . 
i ' m just giving this place my stars , but sparing yelp another rave reivew , because i ' d imagine N is quite enough to convince you to eat here . make the long trip from manhattan , queens , bronx , long island to eat . here . 
last night my wife and i plus N of our closest friends went to this hidden little gem on ridge rd . in lyndhurst . good food plus attentive service added greatly to a nice relaxing saturday night . would also recommend for lunch as their menu has a wide variety of food and portion amounts . 
we waited in line for about N minutes around N N to be led into this beautiful room , european and bustling like an old painting . my friends had the coffee with whipped cream and the shot of water on a silver platter . the waiter denied any methodology for the water -- it ' s just the way they do it . the trout in crepes was great , the cabbage salad with walnuts crunchy and finely seasoned . i had spaetzle with peas , mushroom and so forth , a great thing to eat when it ' s winter and you ' re starving . my other friend had an egg on toast sandwich and they are real foodies who were completely pleased . the apfelstreudel was perfect -- fresh , a wholesome apple taste without chemicals , crisp crust , perfect unsweetened whipped cream . i almost think it would be a great place to go after a quick visit to the museum or an outing all in itself . there was almost never an empty table , and some just came for the desserts which were wonderful to sit by . i felt like a kid in a novel . a beautiful novel ! 
the place was greatly supported by having great friends around me , but for the most , i was just not too impressed . it was good , but not fantastic . 
love ! love ! love ! if you like to eat , this is the spot . love going here for spices . there is so much to eat that ' s it ' s good to go with some friends . buy things . share them . this way , you can try more food . 
one of my favorite places to get pizza in nyc . good service and great food . i highly recommend the pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe and the vodka sauce pizza . great salads as well . 
i feel very comfortable at manakeesh . all the food is delicious and the staff is very kind and helpful . now i do not need to search for an oasis in the desert . i found my west philly oasis and invite all my friends to join me there . 
we went here for my boyfriend ' s birthday , and it was amazing . we specifically reserved a spot in front of yasuda , and we let him choreograph our dinner . not a mistake , although i definitely don ' t recommend the sea urchin . it might be the best in the country but it still tasted like sand . . . the cuts of fish were absolutely perfect , sliced thin and lightly seasoned with wasabi and shoyu , to the point where no more was necessary , and i could just enjoy the texture and flavor of the fish . bill for N people , for whatever it was that he kept putting in front of us , was N . not cheap , but a special , once-in-a-lifetime treat that i feel privileged to have experienced . 
the food at five leaves is good , but my problem is with the service . i have been twice and once the service was fine , but the second time i came for brunch and had the worst service i have had in years . the wait staff neglected to get us menus and even when our waitress stopped by about drink orders she didn ' t glace down to notice we were menu-less . then they brought us the wrong drinks and later they brought us the wrong food . it took forever to get anyone to get us the check . and the icing on the cake ( though not anyone on the staff ' s fault ) is that the bench on the wall has heaters underneath it and the seats turn into a sauna . both times i was there i was sweating by the time i finished my meals . i may return , but it won ' t be until the heat is turned off . 
we love village trattoria ! it ' s reasonably priced and always consistant . the bread rolls they give you while you ' re waiting for your food to arrive are amazing . try them with the olive oil they provide at every table . i could just order those and i ' d be happy . they also have really interesting pizza flavors and great pasta dishes . i tried the large greek salad with chicken and it was suprisingly delicious-- well balanced lettuce to topping combination and the vinagrette was light tasty . dan and i normally order the kitchen sink pizza since it has a nice blend of meats and veggies-- everything you could really ever want on a pizza . we ' ve also tried the broccoli white pizza and that was yummy as well . the crust is some of the best we ' ve ever tasted . the trattoria is probably better for a light fun evening or on a night when you just really don ' t want to cook at home . it can get a little crowded and noisy since everyone in south orange loves it . they do take out and it ' s byob . great stuff ! 
great food , polite speedy service at an affordable price . 
on a cold winter day a bowl of ramen really hits the spot . there ' s a N min wait so try to go early . i had to order the season avocado . it wasn ' t as strange as i thought . the noodles are fresh and hand made but i thought it was a bit under cooked . the pork and broth is amazing
we just came from dining at neb . we waited for over an hour for our food , and this when the restaurant wasn ' t full either . the reuben sandwich was the highlight . chicken rustica had no veggies except limp charred brussels sprouts . the worst was steak frite . it was the toughest piece of meat i ever ate . since the steak took over an hour to cook , they left the fries with cheese on the food warmer . guess what- the fries became limp and greasy with absolute hardened cheese on top awful ! never going back there again
ample portions everytime ! 
i went to little fish for their sunday N course dinner , and for N it is definitely worth it . the service was really good and the food was delicious . we started with a cucumber soup with soft shell crab . this was very fresh with pickled garnishes . may have been my favorite . this was followed by fluke with a peanut sauce . i thought the fish was cooked perfectly , garnishes delicious however , wasn ' t too big on the strong peanut flavors . then we had cobia fish . this had a smokey flavor , delicious garnishes , potatoes and some sour cream . the combo blended really well together . a salad followed . then , we finished with a biscuit dessert with strawberries and coconut ice cream . this may have been the fave of my party . i would def recommend the sunday dinner at little fish
great byob restaurant in the city giorgio is such as nice guy thanks for the nice evening
it seemed to be a popular spot for people who worked lived around there . if you are in the neighborhood looking for something economic , it is a good place . i tried both the platter and gyro . i enjoyed it . it was around Npm during the week . the line wasn ' t terribly long . i waited for about N minutes . it ' s a food cart but there ' s plenty of place where you sit and enjoy your food comfortably . 
this is my favorite place in winooski . the bahn mi sandwich is fantastic . it ' s a very large sandwich for N . N and it tastes really good . i had one with chicken and tried another with pork . the chicken bahn mi was my favorite and the pate in the sandwich really complimented the chicken . when you sit for dinner , tea is offered to you and that ' s a nice surprise . i will definitely be going back to try more dishes ! 
ordered their pork bahn mi . came quickly and was delicious . ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful . their catfish banh mi was also good . ordered their hot vietnamese coffee but when it was served to me it was only lukewarm . their need to increase the temp of their brew . overall a pleasant experience and will def be headed back when i have a craving for a bahn mi sandwich . 
the best meal i have had since discovering i have celiacs . the waitress was extremely knowledgeable to ensure that everything i ate was safe for me , and since it was mexican there were a lot of delicious options for me to choose from . will definitely be back . 
do not go to this diner unless you enjoy being ignored . this diner used to be very good , but has gone very downhill within the last year . the woman at the desk , who is supposed to seat you , ignored us and everyone else waiting for a seat for about N-N minutes . the waitress was so rude i didn ' t even want to leave a tip . they really just don ' t seem to care . i can ' t believe people actually still go there to eat ! anyone who gives this place more than one star , really doesn ' t get out much ! i will never be back unless new management takes over . save your money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i ' m giving it N stars bc of mixed feelings . nice staff and plenty of food for brunch today . took home the buttermilk biscuit and immediately put it in the fridge when i got home . it was not a hot summer day today . cut half , ate . went for the second half and noticed a dark teal colored mass , mold or mice poison , i don ' t know . but if they are serving old biscuits that isn ' t properly stored , that ' s bad . if they are serving old biscuits anyhow , still bad . if it ' s not mold , but random foreign objects around the counter , still bad . i had enjoyed my meal , but i won ' t be going there for their smothered biscuits after finding this in the middle of my biscuit ( about an eighth of an inch . ) the rest of the brunch was was served up quickly with generous portions . drink comes with brunch . unfortunately i will not return . can ' t take chances if i find things like that in my food . 
we ordered on grubhub . it took over an hour for them to make it about a mile and a half to our apartment . then when we got it the order was wrong . people who work at a deli should know what a roast beef special looks like . here ' s a hint it has russian dressing and coleslaw on it . i paid N . N for a dry roast beef sandwich . would not order again . 
i didn ' t actually go to the restaurant . my husband and bil ordered it to go . so i ate an almost cold mushroom and pepperoni pizza , and it was still good . imo that says a lot . i will have to come back to ny and try it again . 
after reading the rave reviews we walked in and set up our name for a party of N . our time was for N N pm . our party of six arrived by N N and we waited until N N to be exact , to be seated . three parties arrived after us , and were larger or same sized and were seated before us . we were forced to stand in the corner on a freezing day next to the window that is un-insulated , and had a strong draft making the parties uncomfortable . after being told , " five minutes till we have your table " , honestly N-N times , we were seated and had to wait another N minutes to have someone take our order . we ordered pad see ew , spicy thai basil noodles , and sesame tofu , with shrimp fried rice . we asked for the dishes to be extra spicy . they arrived N minutes later , and the were bland ( strange for a thai place ) . i am positive they forgot our request , or ignored it willingly . to make matters worse , although the rush was out of control , we found the ny state health dept rating at level " c " , this was crushing , unfortunately we had eaten and waited way too long . looking across the street , all other restaraunts proudly displayed a large level " a " in their windows . over rated
yes it is on the top five best burgers i have had in new york . . . love it here like the great selection they have of burgers and sides , one for everyone . the atmosphere is alright , not the most cozy - mor like a fancy fastfood restaurant . the service is also alright , they where very helpfull as we where N people trying to squeze us in at a N person table . the only thing i don t like is the - no seating before the whole party is there . but i am def . coming back for more - really nice burgers . 
i was bracing myself for the N hour wait , but arrived at N on a saturday morning and got a table for N in a little over an hour ! as others have said , the blueberry pancakes are super delicious , especially because of the maple butter syrup . mmmmmm . and the coffee was strong and very good . however , i wasn ' t nuts about the eggs benedict . the ham was pretty salty and contrary to other reviews i didn ' t really dig the biscuit . it was a little too dry for me . if i waited N hours for that i would have been very dissatisfied . i would wait N hours for the pancakes though ! but , i agree with other yelpers , if you have the luxury of going on a week day , do it ! 
an amazing place . . . best wednesday night place . . . the food is beyond amazing . . . it ' ll bring you back to italy and the raw bar is a plus ! ! ! 
everything on the menu is special , even a simple bowl of spaghetti in tomato sauce . unique breads , spectacular appetizers , robust entrees and delightful desserts . warm friendly service thats always attentive and never intrusive . all this and only a block away from the high line . 
very disappointed with the drop in quality . three or four slices of meat on a grinder is ridiculous . all you can taste is bread . i bought my last grinder from there today . definitely not worth the price ! 
i have a tendency to eat lunch at the same places . i ' m a creature of habit and sometimes i can ' t help it . every so often , i decide to venture into new territory . that venture brought me into jake ' s . the location of this shop on Nth street is easy to miss . i like the sandwich options . i was in the mood for chicken and decided to go with the skinny chicken , which contains fried onions , chicken ( of course ) , red and green peppers and low-fat american cheese . . . oh wait . . . so that makes it skinny ? the sandwich was really good . i ordered mine on wheat . the bread is a sub hero hoagie roll and it is super soft . i bit into the sandwich and said to myself , " self , good choice , you deserve a medal . " if you ' re in the mood for a sandwich , do yourself a favor and make your way to jake ' s . i don ' t think you ' ll regret it . 
deliciousness . service is quick . cheesecake factory is no competition , if you want the best cheesecake come here . 
our group at work from up the street goes at least twice a week to pho dang . we love the soup and no . N and the similar ones and he pad thai too . wonderful comfort food . i always feel better after the pho ! 
good pizza for the western part of nj . 
i walked into tavern on jane and the bartender walked over and introduced himself and it just got better from there on . the food was very good , the service wonderful and the prices decent for a place smack in the middle of greenwich village . i go back often . g
i came here based on all of the great reviews . and while i thoroughly enjoyed my experience i can ' t give it more than three stars . the service was excellent and our reasonably priced bottle of malbec was delicious . the food was tasty but i found the portions incredibly small in relation to their price . the crispy pork belly was delicious but i only got to taste a sliver ! i was also disappointed in the ricotta meatballs and pasta , both were pretty dry . i really liked the free goodies they gave throughout the meal but i would just like to say one thing this is not a " fun " place . i wasn ' t expecting a club , but when we walked in at N on a friday , it was extremely bright , many of the tables were empty , and everyone seated was over N . the older crowd was something that took me by surprise as i didn ' t feel that any of the reviews reflected that . all in all , the food was very well executed and the service attention to detail was impeccable , but i don ' t think the vibe fit what i was trying to do on a friday night . a good place to bring your in-laws . 
i started a yakitori totto appreciation society on another social web site , so needless to say i ' m a huge fan . favourites are seaweed salad , tsukune with brown sauce , enoki bacon , eringi mushrooms , negitori don , totto ' s soup , soft shell crab . . . and i try to squeeze something new every time i go . one star off for the long waits , the no-reservation policy ( after Npm ) , the recent trend of cutting down on ingredients ( separate charge for quail egg and almost no meat veg in the soup ) and to save the N-star for the truly phenomenal experiences . regardless , i have stopped going to yakitori taisho since the first time i ate here -- that enough speaks to how good this place is ! 
ask me why its N Npm and i am home eating my dinner out of take out containers after arriving at peaches at N Npm . no really , just ask me . because peaches is a hot mess and couldn ' t get food out in a timely manner if their wait staff ' s lives depended on it ! short story . . i arrived at N Npm with two friends , were told they didn ' t seat for dinner until Npm , even though the place was clearly still serving and didn ' t clear out the whole time . being N months pregnant with twins , that was already a problem . but i decided to suck it up , because i really liked their food and it was the first nice sunday out . . after N minutes in the sun i asked if we could at least sit inside , and not order till N . we ' re allowed in , mind you this makes us the first people in the dining room . still didn ' t get water or menus or put in orders till N N . and then . . . . proceeded to watch dish after dish being brought out to every person who came out and was seated after us . by N N i was fuming . we didn ' t get drinks , we didn ' t get bread . had to ask for cornbread to tide us over and were still charged for it ! ! ! we ordered sides , a bowl of grits , and meatloaf . . anything complicated there ? ? no ! ! ! ! did our waiter come out to say there was a problem in the kitchen ? ? no ! ! by N N i politely told the waiter we had to be somewhere by N , needed to take the food to go , and a manager comes out to tell us she ' s sorry and she would make sure our order was the next up to the chef . . really ? ? where was it this whole time ? ? and for that ladies and gentlemen , we got N off our check . wtf ? ? ? i would be ashamed and embarrassed to run a dining room so poorly . yes it ' s sunday and one of the first sunny weekends in brooklyn , but the dining room wasn ' t even packed ! the food wasn ' t even that good . i ' m home N hours later knowing i could have cooked , ate , and cleaned up in half that time . wth did i leave the house for ? ? peaches , you disappointing me and frankly ruined our sunday out . i have eaten there many a time and even on their busiest nights and never been put through that bs . you lost a customer . . never again going to peaches ! ! 
casa piquin is a mexican place that ' s a by underrated , as far as i ' m concerned . it ' s very easy to miss , as it ' s located downstairs below street level on bloomfield ave . very good food , served hot , and in a timely manner . byob adds to the fun , and the prices aren ' t bad at all . when i recommend a mexican place in montclair , its this spot . it ' s a close tie between this and seniorita ' s in bloomfield . 
was in nyc with a group of , there were N of us on a saturday afternoon , we called ahead by about N minutes they were able to seat us with in N minutes of arriving which by itself is impressive considering how tiny the place was ! we had N bottles of champagne with us ( byob ! ) and they had fresh squeezed oj . it was a perfect match . in our group we had the seared ahi tuna salad ( very pretty presentation ) , quiche , and eggs benedict - all very good . we also ordered two servings of rosemary fries since they were so amazing . we had slice of pb pie to top it all off , which was impressively light tasting . despite the other reviews , i have to say that our server ramon was amazing , and really made the meal for us . he also recommended a place for us to go for a drink after our meal , which was just perfect . reasonably priced , cash only was a little annoying . 
in short i recommend it , a very fine place . in more details , one can enjoy a variety of excellent organic healthy food prepared in front of you on the grill . while you wait there are many kinds of shakes that you may try and they are fleshly made in front of you . after a delicious meal , you must their coffee it is outstanding . at the end one can just walk over the adjacent place and relax smoking a hookah . - ) what an enjoyable evening . 
die vielen hervorragenden bewertungen sind mir dann doch ein r tsel . ja , new york ist insgesamt ein teures pflaster , aber hier gab es f r sehr viel geld gerade mal durchschnittskost . ich habe allerdings in usa noch keinen guten italiener gefunden . damit meine ich schmackhafte italienische hausmannskost . um die gleiche qualit t wie bei meinem kleinstadt-italiener zu bekommen , mu ich hier wohl mindestens N person investieren . geht mal nach berlin , yankees , da gibt es dutzende sehr guter italiener f r nicht mal die h lfte ! amerika hat einfach keine esskultur , basta ! 
one of the few places for brunch that i have been to where the lunch side may be better than the breakfast side . with that said , make sure you order the corn , unless you are prejudice against corn . i ordered the cuban bread and had previously had the huevos con chorizo . the cuban bread was really good . the chorizo on top made it nice and spicy . the huevos was decent but the portion wasn ' t that much and it wasn ' t unique , so i can ' t really distinguish it from other places . if you come to this place though , i recommend coming early as it does fill up pretty quickly . the staff is extremely helpful and attentive and the food comes out quickly . 
enjoyed dinner here after exploring the quechee gorge . friendly , efficient service and good wines . the brie chicken special was delicious and tasted fresh , and my companion ' s shepard ' s pie was very good . salad bar was basic but fresh . 
we found this place on yelp , and had high hopes due to the good reviews . so on one weekend afternoon , we ventured all the way out to williamsburg to have lunch here . we ordered the scallop appetizer , uni on salmon , sashimi platter , pork belly and party bomb . the quality and taste of the food that we received was not impressive . they do get some points for being creative , but it seemed that they did that at the expense of taste . the pork belly and party bomb were particularly disappointing , as those were both highly recommended items based on reviews . we were left scratching our heads as to why others gave such high ratings . the sashimi quality is average and the cooked food was also not memorable . the portion sizes were also very small even and overall it doesn ' t seem that what we received was worth the price that is being charged . 
trios trattoria - the best pizza , steaks , and fries in the area . also good , better than rustica , or any other place in the hood . i can ' t beleive i didnt try them until now . yum
not as good as i had heard
i have since visited N once in person and ordered takeout three more times . in person the experience , and the food , is much better . with regards to takeout , the first two times of the last three times i ordered were great . the food was excellent ( the buttermilk fried chicken is a stand out from their menu ) and service was clear quick but the last time i placed the same order the mashed potatoes were clearly out of a box , my broccoli was dry , the gravy was obviously canned and everything was cold . i ' ll chalk that up to hurricane sandy and maybe give them a try again when it ' s warmer . 
best devils pre-game bar , hands down . . . cheap beer ( guinness is under N bucks ) , great food , and a great atmosphere . 
i came here on a date night with my fianc after someone recommended that we try their wings . i ' m glad we did ! we had the mild and the bbq wings . they were both really good . the wings were big and we had to take some home . they have a long list of beers , but we opted for cocktails . the cocktails are strong and definitely not " girly . " i liked the place and the ambiance . one star off because i wish they would have more comfortable seating - i felt like the people behind me were right on my back . 
delicious cakes and cookies plus fresh wholesome plates with large portions . i highly recommend the quiche or the california veggie burger followed by a slice of lithuanian coffee cake . don ' t forget the butter cream frosting ) everything here is vegetarian and kosher . 
we were visiting nyc for the weekend and happened upon grey dog after scrolling through yelp reviews in the area . having no idea what to expect , we were so impressed . this happened to be my boyfriends favorite little gem of the whole weekend ! even though it ' s crowded and can be cold in the winter since it ' s a small space and the door is constantly opening , we still had an amazing experience . the staff is so friendly and it just has an overall , cozy feel . definitely check it out ! 
love the place -it is nyc the beet salad was great roasted chicken better this is late night dining at its best
a no-frills , authentic ramen place . i had the minca shio ramen with thin noodles . very tasty . the staff was super friendly and service was fast . the staff and many of the customers were speaking japanese , which is always a clue for good japanese food . prices were N-N , so pretty reasonable . 
my boyfriend and i eat here often and always feel like we ' re being rewarded for coming back ! the menu is creative , fun and well executed , and the atmosphere and staff are laid back but serious about food , drink and service . 
had breakfast here this morning and the french toast and eggs with sausage was great . very spacious and workers are friendly and courteous . fast service and great good a must of you are in this part of town . 
came with a pretty large group so it took awhile to get seat , but the owner was very polite and accommodating about our wait . he even gave us a crepe on the house for making us wait . enjoyed the service--perhaps the best in philly . i got a breakfast burrito . incredibly filling and satisfying . i highly recommend it if you are feeling rather " hangry " . my friends and i enjoyed the brunch experience very much . 
lots of reviews have covered pio pio ' s chicken - incredible and one of the best deals around . make sure to order extra green sauce , as they usually only give you one small container with the chicken . for a dollar you ' ll get three more . if you ' re in the mood for something different ( and not on a tight budget ) , they offer some amazing seafood dishes . i love love love the palta rellena con camarones appetizer ( avocado stuffed with shrimp , corn and tomatoes ) and the camarones cuzco ( shrimp with rice in an insanely good yellow sauce . i would drink it by the gallon ) . the only miss i ' ve had was the cebiche mixto . it was fishy like i was licking a wharf . 
this is the real deal , kids . an interesting style of pizza super-thin crust that is mostly crispy but has a bit of chew to it . this is quite possibly the tastiest pizza available-the taste of each of the structural elements comes through in such a lovely manner , you just want to eat and eat and eat . do yourself a favor and go--now ! ! 
i have seen this place many time but went in their for the first time the other day for happy hour . it ' s a different atmosphere , but i really enjoyed it . the food was delicious and the price was very reasonable . i would definitely come back again . my only complaint was that there did ' t really seem to be one waitress that was taking care of us and they did ' t commentate well . we weren ' t sure who to ask when we needed sometime . . . they could have been a little more attentive . 
took an out of town visitor here based on a lot of great reviews i ' ve read and was pretty disappointed . it was fine . . . it just seemed kind of run-of-the-mill . the pork dumplings were quite good i have to say . but the chicken shrimp in plum sauce and seafood noodles we ordered just seemed bland . also didn ' t love that our party of N was seated at a round table with N other people . that was kind of weird . 
we love this place . . . we are repeat , offenders here , and will be ! 
i was in philadephia with work and had been craving indian food for weeks coz surprise surprise ! indian is my favourite cuisine in this whole wide world . since i ' m new to philly i had no idea where to go to satisfy my craving until last week , when a really sweet indian colleague recommended tashan to me . so off we went , a party of N , to try this place out . on the way she explained to me that tashan meant ' style ' in hindi and i found that bit of trivia amusing . the first thing that will strike you about tashan is that how they have done away with that typical kitschy interiors that most indian restaurants in the us seem to love . tashan is apparently designed by some famous nyc based designer which is probably why they look like a really upscale fine dining restaurant . however , because of the open kitchen , the place smells great , with a great mix of all indian spices and herbs . coming to the food , i ordered the samosa chaat for starters as i was really craving a samosa . my friends ended up ordering the tandoori shrimp and the duck shashlik , both dishes were top notch ! their portions are ideal for sharing and since i was having indian after a long while , i really wanted to try as many things i could . for dinner , we went with the tasting menu which is a great way to acquaint oneself with the things on offer at a new place . we ended up having succulent butter chicken , some quail and also a vegetarian dish . the tasting menu comes with wine pairings which were done quite well . for dessert , we ordered the tashan creme br l e which came with this indian dessert called gulab jamun . it was decadent . i also must point out that even though i didn ' t drink much , i noticed that they had a great wine selection . i really feel that tashan has managed to keep the essence of indian flavours alive while taking the entire preparation to a fine dining level and adjusted the palate to suit our tongues . 
this restaurant has a lot of interesting things on the menu . the wines are also unusual and fun to try . it ' s very tight for space , and i found the food to be too salty . i don ' t go for all that mario batali fan club stuff , but i do think this restaruant is worth a try . perhaps not on a friday night , though , as you will be squeezed in on both sides . 
we were greeted nicely by a server host as we sat at he counter we ordered salad with steak which was good and the turkey burger also good . i had also ordered a chili which was just about the worst chili i ever had , so i took N spoonfuls and left the bowl full . what i found amusing is nobody bothered to ask how it was nor could we get our waters refilled . i know service is a thing of the pass but the basics i would think are still important to keep customers satisfied . i will give them another chance because the burgers looked marvelous . and maybe the staff wont have a chip on their shoulders this time . 
got - steak and eggs - french dips - side of hashbrowns steak and eggs was perfect , rare . pomegranate lemonade really good . french dips was . . . good but not great . meat overcooked and meat sauce not enough dark and consistent . hash browns we did not eat it as we sent it back because of a big black hair mixed with it , super visible on the plate . . . sad when it happens . . . 
this is one of my top restaurants in central nj , overall . i eat here regularly and everything i ' ve ever had is good plus the prices can ' t be beat . the only issue is that you may have to wait over an hour and a half to be seated even on a tuesday night or sunday afternoon . but it is worth the wait go to the bar and have a margarita while you wait ( well tequila will do you fine ) . on the flip side , the service is fast and spot on . they have the best fajitas and i don ' t bother ordering them anywhere else because i know they ' ll be disappointing after having these . the gumbo is outstanding and pretty consistent go with the cup because the bowl is probably to much . other choice items are the chimichurra steak , the blackened chicken or blackened salmon ( you can try the last two on a caesar salad ) . 
definitely one of my favorite places in the city . you get a huge cheese steak for an average price for cheese steaks and they ' re very tasty . if you ' re willing to travel to a slightly sketchy area , it ' ll be worth your trip . 
as good as it gets ! best restaurant in brooklyn for southern food with a classy and funky twist ! i love their freshly muddled specialty cocktails . they got cucumber , cranberry , cantaloupe , any fresh fruit you name it , absolutely refreshing ! gents don ' t say you don ' t know where to find the ladies . ) ladies you know where you want them to take you eat , soco . it ' s the spot to be , yummy . 
i haven ' t been there yet , but hear it ' s a good bet . 
to be honest i love N degrees . it ' s such a shame that their service is consistently inexcusable . i don ' t know if they even have a manager on the premises ever , as that ' s the only reason i can think of that people would even think of acting that appalling especially while they ' re getting paid . what makes me even more suspicious of this is that while their hours are posted online , they consistently close early whenever it suits them . i don ' t know who manages this place . but that ' s ridiculous-- closing at N Npm when your hours say Nam ? someone needs to be held responsible for that because they won ' t be getting my business any longer . 
i order delivery from here all the time . it ' s the only vegan place that delivers in my area . food is consistent and pretty good . 
this is nothing fancy and place is small , but i took my wife and two children ( ages N and N ) specifically for an ethiopian food experience , including eating the " spongy pancake " with their hands . called ahead and had a table reserved for four . ( not necessary to do this , but creates some certainty and they do place a " reserved " sign on your table , creating some extra hype for the family . . . ) . results very friendly staff , clean presentation , food was tasty , and relatively inexpensive . for a family of N i ' d recommend ordering N vegetarian combos and one meat dish . they ' ll bring out one large platter and N plates . kids love being allowed to use their hands ! 
i ' ve only eaten here once . . . and it was amazing . . . i mostly go in to be entertained by kip or gorge the bartender , they make sure to make you feel that they are happy to serve you , very knowledgeable about everything they serve . . . i would be in there all the time if i could afford it . . . its just little too pricey for my likes . . . i quote from another review that describes alot of places in this city . . . N based on the food . N based on the cocky . . . . . . . N is the average . if all you care about is food then go . . . . its high quality . expensive but high quality . great beer selection too . a bit pricey for my likes
service was excellent could not ask for anything more . however the food was mediocre at best . this place serves small portions of food like a spanish tapas bar . no problem here . but the quality of the food was nothing special . the pork belly ( their signature dish ) was mainly fat . and while some may find the basement quaint is more dungeon like than cava . 
oh god , i walked into this place and saw the corn on the cob and it was over . then i saw fried plantains on the menu and freaked . who cares how small this place is because everything is crowded , small , and has a queue in new york anyways . if you ' re not used to it now , i not exactly sure how you ' re coping . . . i digress . . . . . i had the pork in adobo sandwich with the corn , and it was money . just spicy enough to keep it interesting , which is how i like . . . . . unlike my thai food where it ' s totally fine if i taste nothing but the fire in my mouth . if there was a place like this in dc , you can bet your sweet a i would try braving south east for deliciousness like this ( well . . . . maybe only with some other large men in tow . ) 
we went to doma for lunch last friday as a part of my Nth birthday extravaganza . luckily the place is a byo . we sorely needed the hour and a half break from drinking that the restaurant afforded us . on future , more sober visits , i would recommend your favorite sparkling wine ( be it a champagne or a prosecco ) or a french chardonnay like macon-village or pouilly-fuisse . anything light , white and minerally will do you proud though . you wouldn ' t want anything so powerful ( california ) that it would take the attention off of the food . the food , by the way , is fan - f ' n - tastic ! i know this because i generally hate seaweed salad and i totally wanted to devour the one that drew ordered . our extraordinarily handsome server explained that the quality of a seaweed salad is all about the source and storage . this one was less like kissing a jetty and more like making love to a mermaid man ( pick your poison ) . we also ordered a tuna appetizer served with a raw quail egg , seared rice , pine nuts and a deliciously sweet tangy sauce . the combination of ingredients could ' ve been overwhelming or confusing if the dish had been produced by a less capable kitchen . this dish , however , was sublime . we also ordered a sashimi tasting and a handful of rolls to round out our meal . i was impressed that the sashimi was served in a bowl of rice dressed with some interesting accoutrement ( panko breadcrumbs , tobiko , etc . ) rather than boringly fanned out on a plate . the safe-bet pedestrian spider roll we ordered was probably the best i ' ve ever tasted as the soft-shell crab tempura was still warm when the roll hit our table . all in all , this was the best sushi i ' ve had in the city . our server was super infromative , personable and h - o with a capital t , hot . if you don ' t go for the food , go to fuel your fantasies . 
very nice place , i love its interior design . . and the red velvet was simply gorgeous ambiente molto bello , semplice ed accogliente , piatti molto buoni e con prezzi molto abbordabili , provate la torta red velvet superba . consiglio andare sul presto o prenotate perch molto gettonato come ristorante e vicino ad orari pasti si riempie molto in fretta
woa ! ! ! ! ! came here a few times for the N course menu but i will be talking about this one time in particular . . . this is a new age restaurant . . . they have a unique way of presenting and combining their ingredients . where do i begin with this place . it is cozy . its located in a residential area . this is a place to bring someone you wanna catch up with . . . because it maybe the longest dinner you may ever have . . . i came here with friends . . . it was a party of three . we were here almost three hours . we all had a really good time . we had the six course menu . . . i think if i were to review all the foods we had it would take forever ! but this place is great because the staff is warm and friendly . . . they are very accomodating if you have food allergies nursing ( bc my one friend was nursing ) . . . its byob . . . and the food is soooo gooo here . u can tell the chef is really passionate about his job bc of the presentation , detail and ingredients he puts into each plate of food . some of my favorites diver scallops , duck with a nice crispy skin , and chocolate dessert . 
have come here several times . usually it was okay , the food was good . however , the staff is so rude , it ' s upsetting . two stars , instead of one , because i remember they have good days , too . 
so so . . . very pricey . . have had better food . . . . . waiters were nice . . . . . . cool atmosphere
didn ' t get a chance to try any food . . . i was turned off when the upstairs bartender charged the guy next to me N . N for N beers that cost N . N each , and proceeded to charge me N . N for N beer that cost N . N . on top of that i gave him a N dollar bill and received N dollars change . 
why N star . it is a small little space and the food is awesome . freaky made and tasty at a great price . it is a southern indian restaurant but apparently they have added a northern master chef who bought into the business . i had the vege korma and saag panir and it was soooo good i stuffed myself . no naan but they have great chapattis or roti . i ended my meal with delicious mango lassi . clean environ and fresh food and superb manager rajiv . i will definitely come back . it is amazing in as much as it is a personal review there are people who will destroy a business with reviews that you know are false
came here on a first date and sat at the bar . nice atmosphere , cool crowd . off to a great start . ordered cocktails and apps . waited patiently but were really getting hungry . after N min we checked in with bartender -- " oh sorry i forgot to put in your order " . wtf . his follow up was " well there ' s nothing i can do . " wow . been in nyc over ten years and never heard anything as dumb as that . great way to start end an evening . gato needs work . 
how does this place even exist ? i came with my parents when they were visiting new york . their hotel was right in the les so it was a good excuse for me to try out this place that i had read so much about on yelp . the restaurant is located below street level on houston . it ' s a nice little restaurant that seats maybe N-N people max . when we arrived , all of the tables were occupied . we decided to try to share a table with another patron but luckily a group of N left just as we were sitting down . the menu is not large so it didn ' t take too long to decide what we would order . i ordered the spinach-ricotta gnocchi , two of the bubi sandwiches , an arugula salad , and the antipasto for N . this was a serendipitous miscalculation on my part . the amount of food we received was enormous . the antipasto felt more like it should be for N-N people rather than N . the arugula salad was very refreshing . some people don ' t like the slight bitterness of arugula but i love it . the sandwiches were absolutely delicious as well with the focaccia perfectly toasted to a crisp . although , to be honest , if you ordered the antipasto for N , you could probably make a bunch of your own bubi sandwiches . the service here is mostly warm and friendly . there seems to be only N people working here at any one time and when it gets busy , they get a bit flustered . if you want to dine here on a weekend , make sure you make reservations , otherwise , don ' t even try . i would love to come back here again and take advantage of their byob policy . this place is quickly rising on my list of favorite eateries in the city . 
this place is pretty good . i liked it a little more just b c when i got here there was no lines . i actually liked this place a lot more than lombardi ' s . but prior to this i wasn ' t really a pizza fan , but this made me like pizza a little more . also it ' s right next to the brooklyn bridge , so it ' s a nice walk to walk off all that carb . 
great burger . my medium rare bacon chee ( american ) came juicy and melty , great portion of meat , bacon and cheese . cooked correctly , mildly seasoned . usually i can nitpick food and come up with ways it could be better . for what this burger is , i don ' t think it can be improved . fries were thin and crispy and well salted . the place is starting to get crowded , we were there at N on a friday , so be ready for that . we were sitting there for probably and hour and a half and didn ' t get bothered to leave . the staff gets the job done . 
went here N or N times and dined in . food was okay . atmosphere was stuffy ( for a strip mall ) and not very friendly . we returned because it was fairly close and i liked the food back when i went to tcnj . the other night we ordered take-out . i couldn ' t bite my chicken sandwich because it was tough . i tried the other half and had same issue . i opened up the sandwich and realized the chicken was raw , which is why i couldn ' t chew it . it was totally pink . disgusted . we called and let them know . we drove N minutes to go back to restaurant ( on xmas eve ) , and the man behind the counter asked what was wrong- when we said chicken was raw , he offered no apology at all . we were giving them the benefit of the doubt , but after going back and getting no apology or even acknowledging that serving raw chicken is unacceptable , we will never go back . how do you not apologize for failing to serve edible food , especially after someone has to drive back to your restaurant ? foolish . 
a little late on the review but whatever . pros of this event good bourbon selection the food i did get to eat was good helpful staff good venue cons not enough beer distributors vip bourbon was on regular admission list food was very , very minimal over crowded ( seemed to sell too many tickets ) ive been too a lot of events and this was one of the most expensive by far overall though i did enjoy this event and i do understand that it was their first time running this event and i do see myself going back if they do fix some problems ( and keep faithful to that N off for returning patrons ) 
i came here with my boyfriend for valentines day and the service was outstanding ! the food was amazing ( i keep thinking about it ) and i will certainly be back . that was the best N i ' ve spent in a while . . . . . definitely worth a shot people ! the lemongrass coconut chicken and shrimp soup was so good ! the dry pepper red snapper was out-of-this-world , the calamari was great , the ahi tuna dumplings were delishhhh ! ! ! i even loved the crispy duck salad . . . the whole experience was certainly a place to remember and we will definitely be back . 
my friend suggested this place for dinner and after glancing at the website i was impressed and had to eat there . the venezuelan cuisine was very impressive . however , i would have been better served by being more informed about the menu . the food was amazing , we just ordered way too much of it . the place is decorated like it was still under construction with unfinished plywood walls and no bar . seriously , community boards suck . we luckily got a seat in the back garden where the d cor wasn ' t go oppressive . between four people we ordered five arepas , three sides , two soups and a combination plate . omg . we could hardly eat half of it . the arepas were deceivingly big and filling . so my suggestion is to order only two and nothing else . i had the special arepa for the night with pork shoulder , jalapenos , cheese , and fried plantains . amazing . the thing was crunchy and sweet and salty and just plain awesome . i also ordered the soup special for the day which was basically a venezuelan take on chicken soup with avocado in it . it was very tasty but perhaps a bit under seasoned . the reina pepiada was a little underwhelming chicken and avocado salad . i also ordered the yoyos ( fried plantains with cheese in a molasses sauce ) and rice and beans for the table . those two sides got eaten up but it was a little harder to tuck away the rest of the food . the waitress should have warned us that we were kind of over ordering . i know this goes against their rules of squeezing the most out of customers but it would have been helpful and probably secured a second visit from us . 
everytime i ' m in town for business i frequent the shark bar at max fish . N hookednon their lobster rolls . . . a little chipotle aoli and it melts in your mouth . tonight is valentines day and the bartender made a special exception to allow me to order my lobster roll . customer service is a . thanks mike ! 
very small eating area out back , but the waitress was great and food was good as well . we got the N N pigs head which was delicious and my other favorite dish was the N hot dogs , definitely get that ! ! definitely would come back again
i had been wanting to come here for a show for a couple of months and finally had the opportunity a couple of days ago . it was great ! this is my favorite small venue i have been in philadelphia thus far , the sound was good , the layout was awesome , you can get inches from the band , people were polite , bathrooms were clean . . . and the best part . . . you can bring your beer wherever you want ! no " if you ' re drinking you must stay within this area like cattle " rules apply here , run free with your draft of choice . i want to come back and try the food as another reason why johnny brenda ' s gets my N stars , the whole place smells like smoked meat . . . which i think is a good thing . 
these people do what pizza places should do they offer inexpensive , fresh , good italian food that arrives hot and garlicky . what ' s not to love ? their antipasti is great and a welcome change for when you don ' t want so many carbs . their ridiculously buttery , garlicky bow-ties are wonderful for the other N of the time . one star is deducted because a couple of times ( in the N years i ' ve been going there ) , the pizza crust was a tiny bit overdone . all in all , this unpretentious , reliable little place is a jewel to have in our town . 
i don ' t get what all the N stars are about . . . this place was so cute and had such fresh food ! got here with a couple of bottles and enjoyed the whole evening with great food and excellent service . meal to start -flatbread with gorgonzola , fresh berries and drizzled with honey wowowowow ! ! delicious -crab and avocado salad with endive and apple ( good ) main dishes ( shared ) -papardelle with mushrooms and spinach ( amazing pasta texture , so fresh ! ! ) -sole with chickpeas and veggies -marlin with beets and couscous ( grilled and delicious ! ) for dessert -vanilla risotto with cinnamon and dried fruit -lavender infused creme brulee both were sooooo good our server was friendly , honest and helped out and the prices were fair for such a fresh meal will be back for sure ! 
alright people . . . i admit it . . . i don ' t like burgers . ( don ' t hate ! ) so . . . unfortunately i cannot say i can back up any of these incredible reviews for bonnie ' s meat . i can say , though , that my veggie burger crumble salad was really good . and the beer selection definitely impressed me . my salad consisted of grilled portobella mushrooms , a bit of crumbled veggie burger , grilled peppers , a few slices of cheese ( provolone ? ) , sundried tomatoes , and thai peanut dressing on the side . interesting salad dressing combo but it worked . and the salad was the perfect size for dinner . my one itty-bitty beef with this place is that i smelled like food when i left . i can ' t stand that ! i know it ' s a weird hang up but i don ' t like my hair and clothes smelling like what i ate an hour ago . it makes me need a shower . so be forewarned that if you ' re a bit wacky about that like me , make it your last stop for the evening . 
ten stone is one of the best places in the city . it has a great beer selection , it can be a little noisy but sitting outside solves that . the ham and cheese on a pretzel is the best sandwich i ' ve ever had in my life , the honey mustard is to die for . i ' ve even asked for the recipe , it ' s a secret . pretty much everything i ' ve had there is amazing , the flank steak sandwich , cheese fondue ( very big so share with a lot of people ) and the staff is very friendly . its always busy which says something about a place and the staff hasn ' t changed for the few years i ' ve been going which is also a great sign . i consistently choose ten stone over many other philly restaurants i love it . 
always a good time here . delicious meal ! love this place
the dumplings here are just okay . pros is the place is really cheap and its good snack , but other than that , i ' ve experienced waaay better dumplings potstickers in my life . we ordered both the fried ones and the boiled ones , both were of the same kind but of course , the fried ones taste better . i like the thick outter skin but i don ' t prefer dumplings that use a lot of soy sauce inside the filling . good to try once , but not going out of my way to go back again . 
my rating above describes how my experience was pre- pretentious owner deciding to sit down next to our all-filipino table and speak to me , my mother , and my two co-workers about filipino culture . some may read this and just be concerned whether or not the food was good or not ( which it undoubtedly was ) and stop right there , but personally , going out to eat with friends family is more than just what is going into our stomachs - it ' s about the lighting , the waiter , the waitress , the awesome interior design , etc . we were having an awesome time until the owner sat down next to us and started cracking filipino-themed jokes , one of which was about how filipinos pronounced certain words . maybe in an ideal world where there ' s no such thing as ignorance or stereotyping , this might have been acceptable , but to me , it was downright disrespectful and rude . at first , i decided to chalk it up to him being friendly and trying to let us know that he ' s versed in filipino culture , which is cool , but then he decided to tell us that some percentage of tourism in the philippines is attributed to sex . after this comment , i wasn ' t exactly sure if this was a dinner outing , a history lesson , political debate , or amateur night at the apollo . call it taking it personal , maybe he was just trying to make us feel welcomed - but i was insulted and uncomfortable as was the rest of my group . he warned us , jokingly , to disregard comments on yelp about the " annoying , white guy who just sits down and talks too much " but i ' m here to confirm and or warn you that that person was spot on ( if that review is even on here ) . unfortunately , this place left me torn . i entered with excitement and an empty stomach and left with disappointment and angst . sigh 
i finally came here after hearing about the notorious goldroc diner from my husband and his friends , who grew up in the area . they always made this diner sound so ominous without giving specifics about what made it so bad . not that this stopped them from coming here constantly as teens to hang out and smoke cigarettes . honestly , this is just a busy greasy spoon diner . it attracts a lot of people and the staff is overworked and tired of dealing with all the bullshit i ' m sure young people are dishing out to them . don ' t expect an epic meal , just expect diner food and you ' re golden . the parking lot is usually full and the clientele is a mix of everyone . yes , its a bit ghetto , but i ' m from brooklyn so it felt like home to me . maybe the uptight yuppy kids aren ' t used to seeing a variety of ethnicities enjoying some eggs and home fries . seriously , get out more if you have a problem with this . the food was fine . i ordered eggs , home fries and toast . it was hot , fresh and tasty good to me . it wasn ' t the cheapest diner food , but not the most expensive either . i would come back again . kinda disappointed it wasn ' t more exciting since the stories i heard about this place made it out to be something it definitely isn ' t . in the end , this is just a diner . 
well done . food is reasonably priced and cooked with skill . ingredients are obviously quality . service is on point . a fine selection of wines spirits cocktails . an atmosphere that hits the right note between too relaxed and too stuffy , and one that makes perfect sense with the menu . a nice bar . stylish patrons , a mix of ages , who aren ' t trying too hard . a few tiny missteps ( e . g . , some entree portions are smaller than small ) , but overall much to like here . the place has been going strong for a while and doesn ' t show signs--at least to me--of falling off . 
very good food for the price . the line moves fast as well . i recommend the combo plate . 
wonderful wonderful . farm fresh local ingredients made into great dishes . small plates as well as large meals . large local wine and beer selection as well . service was helpful and friendly and most of all knowledgable about what they were serving . 
i was craving for fried chicken waffles . and , we finally went on a sat night before the place got crowded . it was a lot smaller than i expected . it is les after all so i should had lower my expectations . those who grew up in les like myself should know that most places are pretty cramp and small . we got a table effortlessly . the service on the other hand was another story ! my sis and i had their chicken and waffles . hub had their blueberry pancakes . and my brother opt for their burger . the waitress tend to our table for a bit before disappearing . it took over an hour for the entrees to arrive . quite frankly , the chicken was not as spectacular as clinton hyped it up to be . . . it ' s almost comparable to sugar freak in astoria . mine came out a bit soggy and barely had any crispy skin texture . even hub was not too thrilled with it . either the chicken batter was not soaked thoroughly before frying or it didn ' t have much batter . it was very disappointing for the long debut of the dish . the blueberry pancakes were fluffy and good . i still prefer over their belgium waffles any day . the buttermilk aroma in their waffles was too enticing compared to their pancakes . and my bro thought the burger was ok not great . we also had their sweet potato fries and onion rings . the onion rings were way too greasy . the sweet potato fries were ok . def would not recommend ordering those two . service was horrible ! there was one waitress to tend to all the tables . she took forever to get the bill . she had to check her iphone several times prob a texting war . so much for their no cell phone policy ( check the bottom portion of the menu ) . and even walked past our table a couple of times before acknowledging us . we had to flag her down just so we can pay and get out of there . expect this type of service from the over-hyped clinton . so not worth the hype or pricey chicken waffles pancakes . this place is really a one time thing to go to but nothing worth swooning over . bottom line , if you ' re really from ny , you know there are much better brunch dinner spots in the city . sorry but clinton st . is clearly not one of them ! 
butter . honey . hot sauce . fried chicken . all sandwiched between a warm biscuit . oh pies n thighs , you ' d bring tears to paula deen ' s eyes . 
i like amy ruth ' s food as i ' ve been frequenting this restaurant for many years . i find that the food over all is good but has changed over the past few years and continues to change not necessarily bad but original styles or recipes tastes better . i love their salmon croquettes and cheesy grits ! it ' s one of my favorite go to meals and i order it all time . i realize that the recipe has changed and it doesn ' t taste as good as it did about six months ago . i don ' t know either they have a new cook or a new recipe but they should go back to the old recipe , it tastes better ! and the biscuits are too thick sometimes . doesn ' t taste flaky like a biscuit , not completely bad but can be better ! the mac n cheese is always amazing and the chicken and waffles are to die for . the sweet tea will give you diabetes but it ' s worth it . it always packed in the afternoon and for dinner so breakfast is your best bet for seating without waiting on the long line . overall , good food but can always be better . 
this is my first yelp review , but i feel like i really owe posto a shout out since i will sadly soon be leaving this neighborhood ( . posto ' s thin crust pizza is mouth-wateringly good . we have regular cravings for it , and it always arrives piping hot and delicious via delivery . i used to live by patsy ' s , which i loved , but posto kicks their butts ! so so good . we usually get delivery because we love the comfort of our own home , but they have a lot of outdoor tables , which are great . 
ordered take out , worse food i ever had , egg roll loaded with oil , rice dish swimming in oil , lo mein the pitts . wont get my money again
since i am from the home of authentic mexican food ( socal ! ) , i tend to exercise a snobbish flair towards mexican food on the east coast . however , i found that el rey could hold its own in la , as the food was delicious and not overly greasy . the enchiladas that i had were terrific and i found that my margaritas were a great blend . the place wasn ' t too crowded on a monday night , so we lucked out in not being drowned out by a crowded place . they also have a cool secret speakeasy , which you should definitely ask the waiter about at the end of your meal . . . . . . 
i like this place ! firstly , the menu is just straight up comfort food - or what i perceive as comfort food , anyway . there ' s no " new american " frills or fancy diversions - it ' s just italian american food done well . the lack of pretentiousness carried through to its dishes - solid cooking , non-artistic presentation , but so delicious . i really enjoyed the lentil with smoked bacon soup and the sweet sausage over polenta . it just tasted so fresh and familial and homey , but not in a " let me try to give you a warm intimate experience " but here ' s some good food , eat it and be happy . i was happy . 
this place is ridiculously tiny and smells of methane inside , but hot damn , N for N delicious boiled or fried dumplings ? who says things aren ' t cheap in new york ? we tried some dumplings , the duck pancake , and some warm , lightly sweetened soy milk . it was so amazingly good on a cold day in march . the only thing that sucks is that there ' s really no seating anywhere . . . you can bring your goods to the little playground up the street but there ' s not shelter from the elements there . still , worth a try especially if you ' ve blown your dough on shopping in nyc ! ) 
one star i for the friendly ppl that work there . whoever owns this place needs to use fresh oil for those fries man . i mean it ' s right in front of you , when they fry ur fries . the oil was black as if it was used diesel oil or something . that dirty oil destroys the taste of the potatoes . . i went here twice and i dont go back becuz i always see how dirty their oil is . and the other star is because they have good sauces . 
excellent and friendly staff . high quality ingredients and skillful preparation . would get N stars if portions were bigger . last time i was there i needed to order two entrees to be sated . 
really friendly staff , i ' m a long time customer . they have very authentic malaysian food , and everything on their menu is pretty safe ! i will recommend the coconut rice with N little dishes ( they present it on a plate shaped like a leaf , so attractive ! ) the N little groups of different malaysian marinated fish , meats , etc , are really worth trying and they make sure you get to try everything and not too much . the iced malaysian tea is a must try ! ( though i suggest letting the ice melt a bit first because it is a bit rich ) most of all , i really enjoy the surrounding and the lighting . it ' s like a reach into nature without leaving the comfort of a restaurant . make sure to tell them anything about a dish that you ' ll want to customize , such as degree of spicyness , choosing of rice , etc . not too pricy , this is a must try restaurant in chinatown . 
wow i cant get enough of this placeeee ! hot pizza on a cold day ) 
this review is difficult . i ' d give them a N . N for the food quality ( amazing reuben ) , a N . N for price due to the deli meats selling for N pound . . . but a N . N for customer service . i don ' t care how much the owner wants to play the role of garrulous deli guy who banters with customers , as he was the most chauvinistic and perverted store owner i ' ve ever had the misfortune of buying from . he kept calling a N-year old girl baby , telling everyone in the store how beautiful she is multiple times , and even made a gay joke . what a loser . 
really good food , prepared fresh and presented with a smile . what more could you want . 
this place is great . very unpretentious . small quaint restaurant , with only a few tables which is what helps make this place so charming . hostess was very sweet and helpful ( even though she must have been stressed out of her mind dealing with those long wait times ) . i love how they text you when your table is ready . they even give you N minutes after they text for you to claim your table . this means you can actually walk around the area while you ' re waiting ( N hr N min yikes ! ) . luckily , for this place , its definitely worth the wait . definitely go for the biscuit egg sandwich . the biscuit was perfect . please save room for dessert and get their famous hot fudge sundae . homemade hot fudge , need i say more ? plus the ice cream is local- from brooklyn ! can ' t wait to go back and try some more yummy things ! ! 
i ' ll give them a N for now . i ' d take off . N just because of this little girl behind the counter staring at her nails meanwhile i ' m standing there for a while waiting for her to look at me ( even after some throat clearing ) . just to find out she doesn ' t understand speak english . twas my first impression . i ' ve gone back , but the guy who works the fryer and a older woman is quick with their service . no harm done . the dumplings ! N ! better than any cart i ' ve had . just as good as i would get from chinatown without the commute . they ' re not overdone ( that they would just fuse together ) nor underdone ( taste of flour ? ) if you have a dumpling fix , i recommend you to go here if you ' re nearby . i ' ve gone twice this past week . yay for cheap eats ! my bf has been turned off by dumplings because of the mushrooms in them . but the pork and chive dumplings is strictly pork and chive dumplings and i ' m just glad he joins me on my dumpling runs scallion pancake . not great . might have to go back to chinatown for that . i ' m going to have to try their noodle soup . 
angelina is a self centered woman and thinks her customers are worth nothing . she has no class and she sells drugs with her son out of the restaurant . great food horrible person . known felon . doesnt stfu about politics . 
good place to eat and good service . a bit divey for me though . cash only . no credit cards accepted . there is a pnc bank with drive up atm in the same parking area . 
incomplete lukewarm order and delivered N hour late . will not order again . 
we went here for the first time to ring in the new year . jordan was our bartender and personal food and wine sherpa ! he was hospitable , knowledgable and fun . all of jordan ' s suggestions were dead on and delicious ! veal cheek , short rib and some cheeses and meats . this might be my new favorite place in west hartford center . 
firebird is a great little place to stop in for breakfast or lunch ! i absolutely love that they serve breakfast all day . i just wish they were open until N N instead of N N ! whenever i ' m in essex around lunchtime , this is the place i look forward to going ! the space is fairly small , but there is seating . i usually get take-out , which is always pretty quick . every time i visit , i am happy with what i order . the huevos rancheros are by far my favorite , but i just recently ventured into the turkey reuben territory . let me tell you , those huevos have some competition ! i think the portion sizes are fair for the prices , which are comparable to other restaurants in the area . they also have great coffee and espresso drinks . i highly recommend giving this place a try ! 
quick mediterranean food . probably one of the best lamb gyro i ' ve ever had . huge portions and quick casual service . loved the bulgar wheat that came with it . 
we were originally looking at other restaurants in close proximity , but they were all way too loud and didn ' t feel right when we walked in . anyway . as soon as we walked into barbuzzo we knew we had found the location we were looking for that evening . the menu looked good and the very friendly and competent staff made us feel very welcome . we shared a salad and a pizza - both fabulous choices . prepped well , presented well and very delicious . it was a pleasure dining here . 
overpriced . . . the place is a little hipster hole in the wall with limited seating and cute lighting made from colanders . the tables are very very small . . . there was not enough space for the plates and bowls and cups brought to the table and the wait staff weren ' t exactly helpful in helping us out with managing the plates and cups and what not . i ' ve been a waiter for five years so i am very forgiving and understanding about waitstaff taking too long or less then perfect service , but the waitstaff here made it feel like we were lucky and undeserving to eat here . the food was alright and that ' s being generous , there ' s much better indian food in montclair . . . the place looks lovely , but you ' re not eating the ambiance
wings and chicken fingers are awesome especially with the bbq sauce or the honey mustard . the mac and cheese with bacon is also great
i have been to the kite several times over the past year and must say i was really blown away tonight . being a bit of a beer nerd i went for the dogfish event . the lineup was unreal ! ! ! ! ! ! palo santo , sah ' tea , red n white , black n blue , punkin , shelter pale ! i have been to several beer events here and i must admit they do it right , the tap lineup never disappoints . the food has always been my sticking point , but tonight was the first time i tried their new menu . buffalo chicken flatbread was great as well as the vegie burger . my girlfriend and i shared them both . i must say that i am going to start making this one of my regular dinner lunch spots ! 
very good tapas , very small place . some tables in the back are shared arrangements . the for was great , the wine selection very good as well . very expensive though . 
my mom and i have lunch here at least twice a week ! ! ! the food is fantastic and the lunch special prices are phenomenal and they come with drinks ! ! ! the drunken noodle very flavorful and is the best i ' ve ever had and the spring roll appetizers are amaaaaaaaaaaazing ! ! ! the owners are super nice too ! ! ! d
why did we wait this long ? it ' s a wonderful , small prix fixe bistro run by a great chef . i pray it sticks around or the chef , kat , stays in the neighborhood . 
jeepney will make your tummy happy . big , generous portions , lots and lots of flavor . also cute , spunky well-dressed waiters . 
so fresh and refreshing ! ! relaxed but classy vibe . all food was so scrumptious--my husband and i have already agreed we are eating there at least once per week . the jicima , cucumber , watermelon salad was fantastik . all desserts are made in-house , and the vanilla bean rice pudding , bread pudding , and flourless chocolate cake knocked our socks off . the fish tacos were so lightly fried they didn ' t feel heavy in our full bellies . and the plantains were not at all greasy . all the food was seasoned just right . 
i ' ve been here a few times and my experiences varied a lot based on the level of service . the staff doesn ' t seem to be able to handle a larger crowd . not much service and a lot of waiting . there seemed to be a bit of confusion too , but that might be due to their newness when i went . with that said , the food is pretty good . the gator tail is delicious , but the smoke flavor they use for a lot of their stuff is average . good selection of beers although they seem to run out of stuff alot . overall it ' s a good local spot with good selection . just make sure its not busy when you go . 
this is no doubt one of the best eateries in the city any time of a day ! i love their brunches and dinners and , of course , amazing selection of drinks ) the place is pretty loud , hustling and bustling with people talking and laughing , but you can still hear your partner sitting across from you at the table and the music selection is pretty good - lively and welcoming ! the service is courteous and professional and you never feel the wait for your dish . as a matter of fact i always base my choice of the meal on the waiter ' s recommendation and it never failed me so far ! one thing you should be aware of is that the place is so popular that you might be better off calling in advance to reserve a table but if you decide to just pop in then by any means enjoy a drink ( or two ) at the bar while waiting for the table - this will give you more time to explore the place before you are finally seated down . 
this place is the bomb diggs . a diner with an outside patio and music venue club attached . i mean c ' mon . also , the food is dammn good . 
i went here for restaurant week last year , and it did not disappoint . it was nice to go into the city and not have to search for parking or park far . they have a lot right outside of restaurant . we had a large party of N , but we were seated right away a nice big round table that allowed us to converse and see eachother without having to look down the table . our waiter was outstanding and very knowledgeable about the food . the food was outstanding . i can be very picky about italian , but this stuff was very authentic and delicious . the portions were large and most of us left with carry out boxes . the prices are very reasonable , and i look forward to going back . they opened up another one in media a while back that i haven ' t tried yet , but i will definitely be getting there soon . 
the waitress is so sweet , the appetizer is so rich . love it ! 
i scoped this place out for a while before finally dragging my friend to try it and it was delicious . everything was flavorful and cooked just right plus the dinner time atmosphere is very cozy . a must visit in montclair . 
great find in the village ! went there this summer for dinner - even on a sunday there was a wait but you can leave your number and they would call you when your table is about to be ready . the food can be exotic - tongues and cheeks and heads etc . . . but there are also safe bets the deviled eggs are delicious as are the fish dishes ! 
i loved this place , however , there were two really rude ladies that came in and seemed to know the bartender , they were bartenders and they sat there laughing at me and my date like children . they sat right next to us . it was the most obnoxious thing i ' ve dealt with ever , they were blatantly making fun of us . i was drinking water , perhaps they thought i was too cheap to order a drink ? i don ' t know , and i don ' t care . what they didn ' t know was that i had already ordered drinks and didn ' t feel like drinking anymore . we still left a tip , a generous tip ! who are they anyway ? ! it definitely cast a shadow on what would ' ve been an otherwise wonderful experience , beware of two horrible , catty , rude women that frequent this establishment . 
i celebrated my Nth anniversary with my fianc e here ! i ' m a newbie to cuban food . it was an interesting experience , filled with flavorful eats . this place was jammed pack that night ! we ordered the plantain chips with guacamole and the three different types of ceviche as appetizers . i especially enjoyed the shrimp lobster ceviche ! ! ! as for the main course , i ordered the lechon asado . disappointed . i felt like a grease ball after two bites ! if you enjoy consuming pork rinds , this dish will suit you . . . one of these days , i may swing by for happy hour . 
this is one of my favorite places in manhattan because who would not love a delicious well portioned meal for cheap and i mean price . i come here all the time with friends and end up spending N max on a three course meal and wine which also includes my tip . the host always remembers your name so if you bring friends here who haven ' t been it makes you look like a celeb , in an entertaining way . my favorite meals are the ravioli and gnocchi , to die for ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! oh but one time we got the calamari dish , not appetizer , and it wasn ' t something i expected them to serve . so that might be the only thing there that i do not favor . have fun dinning ! ! 
can the portions be any smaller ? ? went here over the summer and thank god my friend picked up the tab because had i been the one to shell out money , i would have asked for a refund . i get it , it ' s tapas style higher end filipino food . but can i get food portions that justify the price tag ? 
oh no ! another meal at yet-another-food-network-celebrity-chef ' s restaurant . but this one is good , and it ' s worth it - no kidding ! but before we begin , six magic words french fries , fried in duck fat ! ( more on that later ) we were here for a late brunch on a saturday and were desperately torn between the breakfast side and the lunch side of the menu . ultimately , the table of four wound up mixing it up and taking a bit of both . the N fixed price brunch is an excellent value and they are flexible with substations , etc . to begin , a little bit of sparkling wine was perfect and their amazing in-restaurant wine shop has a wonderful , reasonable selection . a dry california brut started us out , followed by a semi-sweet french rose . delicious . being able to get up and choose your bottle from a their refrigerated wine cases is fantastic . a starter of warm vichyssoise with grilled scallops was incredible . warm , creamy and complex - perfect for a winter day . we followed that up with a bacon quiche ( large portion , light , excellent crust ) and a funghi pizza ( light , earthy , with a perfect chewy crispy crust ) . but what took the cake was two orders or hand-cut french fries , fried in duck fat . they could possibly win my " best fries of N " award ( and i spent some time in belgium , this year , btw ! ) . crispy , just greasy enough , wonderfully flavorful with a perfect bernais sauce on the side . simply amazing . ( note these are not always available - check for times of the day ) . i wish i could get an order of these after a long night of drinking . all in all , excellent food in a trendy , casual atmosphere at a reasonable value . 
this is a winner , number two favorite bahn mi only because of the distance from me . you can ' t beat the price . 
although i mainly come here for the macarons , i have a major soft spot for the baguettes and sucre salad . the staff goes out of their way to help and be friendly to customers and make each of them feel special . an added bonus is an option to eat al fresco whilst enjoying the view of church street bloomfield avenue . please don ' t be fooled by the seemingly understated interior . it is still enough to evoke a sense of constant warmth and welcome . the window decor of breadbaskets is adorable . 
my favorite restaurant in manhattan- i know it ' s bold but i ' ve been here countless times and i always have a meal fit for a queen . yes , it ' s jam packed ( think N N for your best bet , on on a weeknight ) and yes it ' s crammed . but the tapas- they ' re just so good . the decor makes this a great date spot , - it ' s cozy and intimate , the service is friendly , and the prices are decent . tapas is always a little on the pricier side ( for what you get in some eyes ' but i think tia pol does a good job of alleviating your hunger- if you order the right stuff . so here ' s the a list ( well everything is a list but here ' s the super a list to make the most of your aunt pol experience ) - in no special order N . soup of the day- when i last had it it was the gazpacho , it ' ll turn you onto to cold soups ! N . ensalada de alcachofa- the creamy lemon dressing is the bomb , this makes the dish N . patatas bravas- the classic tapas staple . my favorite thing on the dish ( well that and the chorizo ) N . croquetas de jam n y croquetas del d a- very good but passable if you don ' t want to order the whole menu N . fired garbanzo- another staple N . pescado en adobo- most things in adobo tastes good . that ' s true for this dish too . a nice size for tapas too . ( and an unusual one ! ) N . chorizo in sherry- lucky number N- i guess i saved the best for last ( always in a tie with the potatoes ) . come to think of it , i could have eaten just these two dishes- they ' re the best on the menu . then i ' d probably die the next day of a heart attack but at least i ' d die with heaven in my mouth ) a lot of people like the squid ink with rice , but i think it ' s better at mercat ( i can ' t believe i betrayed my beloved aunt on that one note but i otherwise don ' t like mercat ) . i can ' t lie to my fellow yelpers . all in all , been born and raised in the N and can ' t say there ' s any other tapas place that beats tia pol to the punch . 
ok so i was extremely excited to go here and had read all of the excellent reviews . i put our name in on a saturday for brunch with a N minute wait , and they aren ' t lying , it ' s no less than the time they give . once we sat down there was a large party next to us with two long tables of people celebrating something . we had the same three waiters that they did and it was blatantly clear they were super focused on the party table instead of us . we never knew who our waiter was , it took me getting up to ask for our check or i ' m pretty sure we ' d still be there . i can appreciate the work that goes into a large party of N or so , but for a restaurant like this to let it disturb service so much , especially after you wait for N minutes . . . i was surprised . the unfortunate part was that the ravioli were amazing , unlike any ravioli i ' ve ever had , perfect pillows of cheese ! but the service kind of ruined it in my opinion . sorry abc but looks like i caught you on a bad day . 
not really that great . service was horrible ! breakfast ends at N and we were seated and ordered our coffees by N N . we were given our coffees around N N and our waitress took our order for breakfast . at N N our waitress comes back and informs us our breakfast cant be made because breakfast is over . we ordered lunch and got chili and blt . another N mins goes by we are informed chili hasn ' t been made . our blt comes out and the bacon was raw , bread untoasted , with all of the meat on only one half of the sandwhich . this place needs to get there shNt together , but until then i would avoid this place . the only area in which they did well was the artwork on the walls , but honestly being trendy isn ' t why i eat somewhere . 
i have been to laetus several times and enjoyed a great time on every occasion . they have wonderful food which you cannot find in other restaurants in hartford . if you like to eat asian food laetus is the place for you . you can have a full meal or just appetizers and a drink or two . if you like to dance , go to laetus later at night to have a good time . if you want to have a birthday party or any other party no problem , you are guaranteed an excellent time . give it a try , bring your friends , enjoy the service and all the staff . you will be greeted by the owner , hai who will make your stay very enjoyable . 
the exterior is a bit over the top , the interior a tight , the food and service are very good . the place should be renamed papa gino ' s because gino , the owner , is a hands on and creates some nice dishes . 
the place its very noisy out of control like all spanish restaurants but hey the food is great cheap . if you think their prices are expensive you shouldnt go out just stay home eating homemade food you see what i am talking about . 
sadly enough , we ' ve been here many times over the years . it ' s usually a sign of being tired , thirsty and either not having a reservation at a better place or not being willing to wait an hour for a seat at the nearby pf chang ' s . atmosphere is good . drinks ok ( usually get beer or wine ) . food usually passable , but not always and the service varies from competent to horrible . swore off the place for good one december after waiting forever for our food only to have a truly disgusting dish plopped down in front of us ( a skillet dish , i think , that probably sat for at least half an hour under a heat lamp and self-destructed . ) . returned once after that ( and quite a bit after the revelation that this was one of the places caught cheating on their drinks by nj ' s operation swill ) . on that more recent trip , our waitress was competent and the food was decent ( by chain standards ) , so perhaps they ' re under new management ( and hence the Nnd star ) . 
the bartenders are charismatic and attentive . the food is affordable and good . i ' ve only come for happy hour , but it ' s a nice spot while in center city or old city . 
first off , do not order the east of buffalo wings . simply put , horrible . " breaded " before frying has nothing to do with buffalo and the sauce was sketchy . the pizza " solar flare " was ok , but american flatbread was much better . beer selection was good , but if you ' re comparing to flatbread , go there . if you ' re looking for food at " the corners " and don ' t want moe ' s , it ' s ok , but definitely not a destination . 
ok so this place only accepts cash , big deal . the cost of a meal for two will only set you back N- N so make sure you have a few bucks in your wallet when you go . any of the bad reviews of this place in my opinion are ridiculous . the food is always fresh , the pho is delicious and will warm you up on a cold day . the vietnamese egg rolls with lettuce are one of my favorite treats to eat . ( are they gourmet , mouth watering delicacies ? no , but this is simple asian street food presented in a comfortable clean place - so take your expectations down a notch ) . also i have always found the service to be very friendly and attentive . i cannot give it N stars because i have never had pho in vietnam so it may not be the best in the world . it is the best in central jersey though . 
pretty much loved everything about this place the interior has a great setup , all wood , good amount of seating , with some tables and some bar like seating by the windows i also love that its a cafeteria type of place where you grab food and seat yourself , makes things easier and quicker . the staff here is very friendly and helpful the food the pulled pork was very moist and had a nice flavorful sauce the side of slaw and picked peppers and celery were good as well the wings were my ideal type , just slightly crispy yet moist ( and non of that soft skin crap ) they also had a great kick to them that didn ' t burn my tongue the burnt end beans were beyond words delicious and what all beans should taste like need to go back to try all the other meats to see how much better it could get i ' m lucky that i didn ' t have to wait in any line at all when i came here , but would probably say that it would be worth at least a N minute wait , since i saw how the line usually gets here
i always have a great time here . . . it ' s getting in that ' s the hassle . the ginger at the door needs to remove whatever crawlled up his butt and died ! 
my favorite pizza in bk . and they deliver ! really great slices . also when you go in to eat , they have amazing roasted garlic and spicy peppers to put on your pie . the salads and other apps are good too . highly recommended . 
need better management and food quality has to be better . since their website wasn ' t working ( not paying their web hosting fee ? ) , i couldn ' t get the N coupon from their webpage . i asked if they can give me the N off , they refused saying the owner not in . . . . what the heck is that ! ! ! took the food home and found that the sushi and the udon were terrible ! ! ! ! we have found that the quality of the foods is getting worse and now the service is typical of a chinese restaurant . . . they don ' t give a h t about costumer service ! ! been a customer for a long time and now it is time to find another sushi place . . . . . 
this is a wonderful addition to our neighborhood and certainly poised for success . my love and i were on the way to meet a friend . . . were invited in and never made to our destination . eddie gave us a grand tour and more than N cent tour of tequila and mezcal . the oysters were fresh and seemingly harvested momentarily from the ocean . along with the fresh watermelon and pineapple bases for the house tequila , the guac , the queso fondido ( ? ) and ceviche was amazing . with some college football in the background and no one playing around behind the bar or kitchen , i am delighted to offer this review for this wonderful restaurant from already successful ( restaurant row ) and well versed owners . happy hour . . . did i mention that ? see you there - jonathan
fantastic food , service and ambiance--and brittany spears a few tables away . 
hi everyone . my name is frank and i ' m addicted to the eggs benedict at cantina los caballitos . i ' ve been using bennies for around a year now and i don ' t know how it got this far . i wake up early , too early in fact , and have to claw anxiously at the door until N am when they open . i usually eat it so fast that i sometimes have to place two orders just to satisfy my cravings . i tell my normally hospitable and friendly servers that the extra order is " for a friend " but they know who its really for . i ' ve tried to curb my obsession with the tostadas de jamon , the breakfast burrito or huevos con chorizo , but nothing can replace the satisfaction of a hit of bennies , especially when i wash it down with a reasonably priced can of tecate or any one of their delicious margaritas at brunch . i ' ve tried to concoct my own batches at home , but nothing compares to what the cantina cooks up . cantina is to eggs benedict as walter white is to blue sky . i don ' t know how long i can go until my next hit of that eggy , crispy , bacony , sweet deliciousness . 
my husband and i are regulars here . we love it ! food is always excellent , service is fantastic , and we especially enjoy the relaxed atmosphere . i would suggest making a reservation if you are going on the weekend . go , enjoy ! ! 
the counting room is an amazing spot to meet friends , have a cocktail or a glass of wine from an impressive wine list , and share a plate or two . . . or three . great local beer list too for the non-wine drinker . the dual space is incredible and the atmosphere , laid back and fun . the food is wonderful , affordable , and prepared in a tiny " kitchen " behind the bar - right in front of you . the aroma of sizzling garlic and herbs invites you in from the street , or lures you up from the cocktail lounge below . must-haves from the local menu are the herbed croutons , deviled eggs , and fresh ricotta cheese . carnivores will love the meat plate . staff is friendly and welcoming . a perfect brunch spot - especially in warm weather when the industrial garage doors are up . check it out before you can ' t get in ! 
returned to above for another delicious meal . the food gets better each time . it is located above a gourmet market and one would never expect such a classy beautiful restaurant . the staff is well trained and most accommodating and everyone loved their meal . the salmon with fresh veggies was outstanding as was the filet mignon and chilean sea bass . we will definitely return more often . 
i have been in restaurants where the service was mediocre or inattentive . pietro ' s , however , moved from that level of total disregard for service to mean and nasty . i eat out all of the time and have never been treated this badly . we made a reservation for N and all of us sat at a table for N although there was no one nearby to our table nor did any one sit at any nearby table for the total of N hours we were in the restaurant . it got worse however . my personal favorite was the server yelling at a N year old to remove her fork from her plate . and . . . . it goes on . . . . . as we were putting on jackets to leave , the clearing staff began pushing the tables together by shoving them into us . and this was after we left a N tip . how did you manage to find so many terrible people and put them together in one part of the restaurant ? you really need to think about restaurant management and policy . ok pizza and a bunch of lettuce on the plate cannot compensate for this . 
i had never had an experience in america where i would walk in a store and just be surrounded by all things italian . eataly was a premium supermarket in which everything they sold seemed to be italian . i did not really pay too much attention to be honest . i did have lunch over there and ordered massese pizza . the pizza was fresh ! ! you could tell via the taste ! no more oily dominoes or bulky giordanos . . . this pizza was melting in my mouth . loved the mozarella cheese witht the spicy salami and most of all , the crust . i have heard rumors that there might be an eataly in chicago . i for one hope that that rumor is true . 
 N ( pre tip ) in and out for N N N people , including a pitcher of margarita and plenty of food . . . . sign me up . . . . anytime . food was great- stellar guac and chips , ok quesadilla , good mac cheese for kids , a bit salty of the mixed bbq platter- but what do you expect its smoked bbq . . thats what the margarita is for . sat outside on beautiful wednesday night . lots of street traffic and full dining section gave great energy . highly recommended the outdoor tables in between camino and ferdinand good service- and good insight to how to best accomodate the kids . would definitely head back for a night out- seems like it would be a great meet up spot . 
they have very unique and never seen before items on the menu ! i recommend the mango avocado salmon salad and the sushi " pizzas " ! so delicious ! ! their service is quick , warm , and friendly ! i love them and the lovely ppl who work there always treat you like family when you dine there ! it ' s right next to the train station so very convenient for me ! this place is a must ! 
been waiting to try bar bruno since its opening two weeks ago . stopped in on a very heavy and N-bag trek to the subway before the hurricane hit , and i ' m so glad i did . fantastic chateau de roquefort ros on special , delicious ceviche tostadas at the bar . great buzz , cool decor , much-needed nighttime spot in this little area . can ' t wait to come back ! 
cool chill crowd with awesome bartenders . there ' s this grapefruit drink there that i really like but unsure of the name . will def . be back to try the tapas ! 
comfort food at a low price and they ' re open late . their menu is also extensive . 
this place seriously blew my mind . aged cheddar shortcake , duck leg confit , trout with cabbage tartlet , cured pork belly and kale celery root strudel were the highlights . oh wait , that ' s everything i ordered . in other words , everything on their menu is amazing . great ambience , friendly staff , beautiful patrons - what you look for in a west village gem . oh , and the prices are very reasonable . too good to be true . check out the full review here calimari . tumblr . com post 
went here for my birthday tonight . went for new years eve a few years ago and i have no good reason why it took me so long to come back . it ' s still excellent . the service is really friendly and attentive ( constantly refilled my water glass , asked how everything was ) . got an excellent wine recommendation ( one of the best red wines i ' ve ever tasted- a zinfandel ) . i just love the atmosphere- it ' s very cozy and laid back . the food is so delicious and fresh with unique flavors . i ' d recommend specific dishes but i know they change the menu every day . you can ' t go wrong really with anything here . great brooklyn restaurant and really not super expensive compared with comparable places . 
place is beautiful-however , the food was not . i chose a grilled octopus appetizer which was okay-nothing to write home about . for dinner i had the soft-shell crab special which i was excited to try . the crabs were not well cleaned and when i cut into them they oozed the infamous yellow mustard which made the dish unappetizing , along with my boyfriend ' s appetite . for the price of this dish , the crabs should have been thoroughly cleaned by the chef . the other dish we tried was a chicken in pastry-we were not impressed . the on tap brooklyn beer was crisp and delicious , as was my glass of red . all-in-all , way too pricey for the " just okay " food which should have been much more impressive , tasty and minus the " mustard . " 
this is a very nice little restaurant settled in a quiet neighborhood . the food was great ! the ambiance is a little misleading . it kind of looks more like a bar inside than anything . the servers were all very attentive . 
last month , my wife and i split a sandwich at hershel ' s deli . as far as philadelphia delis go . . . . it doesn ' t get any better than this ! my wife and i have heard all the buzz from their many reviews on Nwip , unbreaded . com , and phillymag , but we had to check it out for ourselves . as you walk up to the deli in the famous reading terminal market , you are thrown back with beautiful slabs of meat that are hand carved by expert sandwich makers . i went with the pastrami corned beef combo rueben and boy did my life change ! i haven ' t had a sandwich this good since i made the pilgrimage to katz ' s deli in ny a couple years ago . watch out katz ' s , hershel ' s may have the best corned beef and pastrami i ' ve ever tasted . the meat is so juicy and tender that it makes you wonder how they even do it . so while i ate my sandwich the friendly owner , steve , explained the whole process . he told me they make their own meats on site ! ( can ' t get more homemade than that ) . along with the huge tasty sandwiches , they also have great side salads and i had to get an order of latkes because they make them to order and it brought be back to my child hood . since my first visit to hershel ' s , i ' ve been back three times and will be back as soon as possible . it ' s about time , someone perfected the jewish-style deli in philly ! herhsel ' s is a can ' t miss ! a ! ! p . s . they serve the best breakfast on sundays ! ! ! ! 
all day this past saturday , i had a craving for galbi ( korean short rib ) , so , after debating the merits of going into the city and coming down on the side of laziness , my husband and i walked from clinton hill to prospect park to try out kimchi grill ' s new storefront . i ' m a fan of their truck ( it parks near my workplace once a week ) , but i ' ve got to say , the brick and mortar experience was disappointing . i ordered the kimchi bowl with short rib , expecting the meat to be tasty and tender and just a little bit fatty . instead , my bowl came with meat so overcooked it appeared black . ( i actually took a photo , thinking i could include it here to show i ' m not exaggerating . ) the short rib was tough , dry , and totally unsatisfying . their other menu options may be better , but i was so bummed with my dish that i won ' t be coming back to try them . 
hands down the best lobster roll i ' ve ever had . same can be said about the chowder . if you like shellfish , you absolutely cannot go wrong . friendly staff , cosy environment , i highly recommend . 
for N- it ' s the best N meal you would get- it ' s probably a N star for street food but in keeping with my other reviews i feel this is fair . i will say it ' s better than some restaurants i have been to
tasty steak , only go here trashed after Nam ( when jim ' s closes ) . which sadly ends up being more often than i would like . does the trick , lines aren ' t that bad just be prepared to pay cash immediatly after ordering or they will just brush you aside for the person behind you . leaps and bounds better than geno ' s , but don ' t measure up to jim ' s or tony luke ' s . not the best steak in philadelphia , not the worst . 
i love this place . . . happy hour beer and oysters . N mains . good service and always fun . 
bf and i went here over the weekend . the hostess said the wait was an hour forty five but we were seated an hour and a half . kudos to them . i ' ve never waited that long for dinner and they don ' t take reservations which i am not a fan of . but overall i was impressed with a couple of factors . food for appetizers we had the crispy pork belly and pork buns . i did not think these were good despite all the rave reviews . i ' ve had these dishes elsewhere and they pale in comparison here . for dinner i had karaka men with tamago added and they were excellent . i liked this ramen way better than shin sen gumi but the bf ' s akamaru modern wasn ' t as good . food - N N N service such excellent service . the staff was awesome . i requested hot water because it was freezing outside and they were very accommodating . water was never empty and the food was out in matters of fifteen minutes of sitting down . now if this was fine dining restaurant i would question the Nmins food but this was street food and i commend them for getting the service and food waiting factor down to the tee . N decor cool trendy vibe . N N N now if only i can befriend the hostess or the owners is i wouldn ' t have to wait in the hour and a half line ! would i come back ? maybe when i figure out which night is a slow night for them . perhaps a weeknight . but until they have a reservation system ( which i doubted ) i won ' t be spending another weekend night here . 
i would never , ever go there or order delivery from this place again . first the breakfast sandwich is so tiny , i have never seen one this small ! second don ' t order delivery because they wont charge you the prices on their menu , they will definitely charge you more for every item ! i ordered N egg sandwiches and two coffees and got charged N . N . on the menu it says the coffee costs N cents ( that ' s the only option ) - however , they elected to send us the large size for N . they also charged us N . N for delivery to bayonne and the menu says delivery is N . - when i called the mgr to ask the charges be explained ( the receipt doesn ' t have a break down of charges ) - i was told my receipt has a break down and they didn ' t have time to explain . i called back and the manager hung up on me - i also heard the manager raising his voice at an employee while they had me on hold- terrible business and they don ' t even deserve one star ! this was a compete waste of my money ! 
we have a great local in the ' hood . my spouse and i had dinner tonight with friends and their children and it was great . the selection of beers and the menu is wide for a small place and the atmosphere is family friendly and the wait staff courteous and helpful . a calamari starter was shared by N adults and we all commented that it was tender and the spicy aioli a nice touch . the draft beers were all perfect temperature unlike most places in burlington and the surrounding area who think all drafts are supposed to be freezing cold . my cod fish and chips were lightly breaded and tasty with as good a side of slaw as can be had in the area . the chips are hand made and everyone at the table said they are excellent . my spouse and one of our friends had the portobello panini and both said it was excellent . i thought our other friend was over reaching with expectations when he ordered the hangar steak but it looked great and he said it was a fine cut and well prepared . the children went through mac and cheese and fish and chips and then had dessert on top and everyone at the table remarked on how good the brownie was as we kept sneaking pieces while he skipped around the restaurant and entertained himself with the darts at the other end of the room . like i said the place is family friendly and a great atmosphere for a local . after reading the only review on yelp , i expected the worst and expected high cost . the entire meal cost about the same as it would to eat in most pubs taverns in the area but the selection , ambiance and friendliness of the place and the fact that its local will make regulars out of us . i so hope the town tavern succeeds . we have needed a good local in s . burlington shelburne for a long time . we have one now . 
reading terminal has always been the go to place when i want to spend some time exploring and shopping . the area is one big space in the first floor with small shops and stands , all throughout . you can find almost every cuisine of food , books , soaps , gifts and more . some of my favorite stands include the homemade candle shop , the amish pretzel stand and the amish bakery as well ( i ' m sad i don ' t know the official names ) . overall an awesome place to take friends who aren ' t from philadelphia , but be warned it is usually always crowded , especially around lunch time . it ' s definitely a tourist attraction and might not be the best place to go if you need to run in and out very quickly , since it does take some time to navigate through all the people . just go in and walk all around when you have some free time , i usually end up walking out with purchases i never intended on and always end up happy with everything ! 
the corned beef pastrami rueben combo was out of this world . food smackdown rightous . our whole party was attending a convention accross the street and hershel ' s came highly recomended by the people at the hotel and at the convention center . boy were they right . the staff was incredibly friendly and everyone in our group gave it two thumbs up , a definite don ' t miss in philly . will without a doubt go back when we return . 
i am an indian living in us for N years now . benares is definitely the best indian restaurant i have been to in us ! ! the banarsi kachori was great . we also had baingan mirch ka salan , nawabi subji , paneer bhurji and soy tikka masala , which were all distinctive in flavor ( unlike a lot of indian restaurants where all the dishes with red gravies taste the same ) and delicious . the ambience was great too ! the music was very good and different , unlike other indian places which have the same N ' s hindi film music . the portion sizes were good and the service was attentive . i will definitely be going back here ! ! 
pretty good burger place . i ordered the chopped salad , -which had a bed of greens , shredded carrots , cucumbers , red onions , cranberries , and candied walnuts- and i added grilled chicken to make it a substantial dinner . my partner ordered one of the burgers- i believe it was " the smoker " sans the bacon . we both thought it was good , but maybe not worth stopping by if you are visiting the area and only have a limited amount of time to do so . if you do have time and are staying for a while i would definitely check it out if you are looking for a decent burger . you can customize your options as much as you ' d like so that ' s also a plus . metered parking everywhere , also a plus . a bit of advice we came in during N degree weather so if you are doing the same try and request a seat that is not by the doors . omg was it freezing every time someone came in left . maybe i ' m being sensitive because i ' m accustomed to california weather , but damn was it chilly . 
we went to fasil for the first time on sunday after hearing several rave reviews . we were not disappointed ! they have redone the place beautifully and the staff was very welcoming and friendly . everyone enjoyed their meals immensely , from the salmon and bronzini to the lamb chops and kabobs . and all at a reasonable price . with the lack of excellent restaurants in the montville boonton area , it is no wonder fasil is quickly becoming the toughest reservation in town ! 
this place is loud , fun and pretty good , the thai food is compentently made and presented - the crowd was mixed and pretty laid back . silver , mirrors , booming music and voices my girlfriend and i were screaming at each other to be heard . the decor is cool , including the glass-encased chandelier in the middle of the restaurant . dinner for two people , with lots of drinks and champagne ( i think ) was N ( what i consider to be reasonable in nyc ) . 
yummy ! out of a possible N stars , here ' s what we thought . . . . d cor N star service N stars beverage list N star food N stars location N star overall N stars cost N - N per person for the complete review with photos please go to nycfoodreview . wordpress . 
best sushi in the united states . i live in los angeles , where you ' d think they ' d be better , but i ' ve yet to find a local place that matches the experiences i ' ve had at yasuda . everything there is done with perfection , and anything less than omakase is just wasting your time . by all means , sit at the counter , engage your chef , and you will learn much in the ways of fish . 
i am so happy to have a bbq place in fort greene that ' s better than the mediocre smoke joint . while this place might not be the most consistent every time , when it ' s good ( which is most of the time ) it hits it out of the park . the pork ribs are excellent , the chicken is great . . . sides are delicious too . there a cute patio out in back as well . i hope it sticks around because the location ' s a bit off the beaten track of myrtle . please support this place ! ! ! ! 
breakfast or any time , this is the spot for great food in a relaxed and fun atmosphere , i go here often . everything is delicious , but make sure to try the bloody mary , which is perfectly spiced , and i love the apps . 
tinto a great tapas restaurant that just opened up in philly . their tapas have a basque inspiration and are quiet tasty , though they are extremely small . the wine list has great price range and the wait staff is well versed . the owners also own amada , which i is serves more traditional tapas . both restaurants are great for dates spots ( for tinto reserve a cozy table in the basement ) 
love the ambiance ! ! ! ! the food was great especially those truffle fries . and our server lucy . . . was very attentive and answered our menu questions as best as she could . i will definitely go back for more ! 
really i have been ordering take out from here for at least two years but the last two times they " lost " the order and then were rude about it and kept lying about it being " on the way " the last time i ordered it took N . N hours and N calls to get my food . . unacceptable and they didnt even give me a discount afterall that . . . they are off my list
was a fan of this restaurant until the night i ordered the salmon and immediately got sick after . i N received food poisoning after this meal . so gross . 
food is good , not great . i don ' t get all these N and N star reviews , but the bartender and host were pretty nice , so they get extra points for that . our wait was a little long , though expected . the bartender was very informative and a good seller . he sold us on a seafood tray while waiting for our table . it was good . for dinner my husband had the fried chicken , which was pretty good , and i had we started off with the fried oysters ( good ) , and the bone marrow and braised oxtail marmalade ( too sweet for my liking , but my husband loved it ) . i had a dinner special , which clearly was not good because i don ' t even remember what i had . would maybe be back for some drinks and seafood trays , cause this place is pretty poppin ' , but the dinner menu needs a little more exploration in the creativity department . 
come here often , and the servers will be sure to remember you . the service is a little eh , ( sometimes you have to flag them over to tell them you ' re ready to order ) but they really are sweet ! pho here is delish along with the summer rolls and the tea they serve you is just as good . mekong river is very clean and visually appealing unlike a lot of the other pho places i have been to . their bar is also really appealing too ! in the mood for dessert here . . order the flan ! 
let me tell you that this pizza is one of a kind and this is the reason you should try it . it is expensive ( i agree ) but worth it ! ! ! different taste of pizza . 
i can ' t tell you how much we love this place ! within two blocks of our house there are three convenience stores delis , and neither of the other two even compare . in addition to having pretty much everything you could need in terms of snacks and toiletries ( the usual quick store fare ) , their made-to-order hoagies , salads and sandwiches are among the best we ' ve had in the city . there are choices for any dietary restriction . the vegetarian hoagie is excellent ! perfect bread , fresh avocados and sprouts , and you never have to wait more than five minutes for anything . the best feature at the palm tree is that they cater to everyone . they carry the standard products like coke and hershey , but even in the small space they have a huge selection of organic and all natural products that you usually have to trudge up to whole foods or a specialty market to find . the staff is unbelievably friendly , the place is always spotless , and everything is more than reasonably priced ( N- N for a sandwich or salad ) , especially for the quality of food you are getting . 
the place really approves its high reputation ! food is something extremely delicious ) service is great ! design of the place is also cool . can ' t wait to there again ! ! ! 
good food at a good price . enjoy the happy hour and grab some tacos . i enjoyed their charizo tacos-- they had a nice kick to them . the nachos with salsa and guacamole is also a must for big groups trying to enjoy some drinks and tasty eats . the place is sometimes very crowded , but that ' s also kind of the appeal . 
estia restaurant ' s food is very delicious with good service . the zucchini chips are delicious , which i never experienced before . the restuarant is clean and beautiful all the way to the bathrooms . i tried this restaurant N new year ' s eve ago , ordering from the pre-fix full-course menu with a glass of champagne included , plus an added gratuity for the holiday . although i did not like the dj music , it was okay for being able to accommodate a minor children in the party , and the event ended at Nam . i look forward to trying estia ' s for bunch and other specials . quick note to estia please hire a better dj for new year ' s eve . 
was looking for a place to get sushi in town since my mom and i didn ' t feel like driving very far . the overall reviews were great so we went and tried it out . so glad we did because we ' ll definitely be going back again . it has a very cute atmosphere with throw pillows on a wall bench and good quality napkins ! the servers are nice and personable , great music that ' s not just instrumental , but actual songs . the food itself was well priced . i ordered a green tea bubble tea which was delicious and the tapioca bubbles were fresh . yum . we split a spicy tuna , mango shrimp , and shrimp avocado roll . the plating , as others have mentioned , is spectacular ! we also got a veggie tempura appetizer and the bill came out to about N definitely worth trying out to see for yourself . 
definitely make a reservation , but hands down scarpetta is a beautiful restaurant . the bread basket with marscapone butter , and olive oil fantastic and the duck foie gras ravioli was my favorite . all in all great ambiance , great service , great food . can ' t complain even about the bill , save up and splurge its worth it . 
this place is very tourist-y . the decor is beautiful and absolutely reminds me of old school new york . but this place is sooooo loud and crowded ! loved it nonetheless . my only problem with balthazar is that it ' s so crowded that i have to get wedged into my table and can ' t get out again until the end of the meal . there ' s absolutely no privacy and everyone is all up in everyone else ' s conversation . dinged another star because i was super excited about the onion soup . nope ! way too salty . mine was super salty and hardly any broth because the large piece of bread soaked it all up . my friend ' s soup was salty and all broth only , no onions . very inconsistent . i would come here again though . . just for the service and the apple tarte tatin . yum ! 
i ' ve always wanted to know what as across the street from solas and finally got my chance today . came here for mother ' s day dinner tonight . we were a party of five so instead of sitting at the lively counter , we opted for the table as we had flowers and it was easier to share food that way . . . next time if i come back i ' m def . looking for some counter space . as many other people mentioned , this place will def put a dent in your wallet if you ' re looking to be full or eating with a group . we ordered N rice bowls ( sea urchin , salmon roe salmon , and chicken ) , a full grilled porgy fish , hot udon , an appetizer , N vegetables , and N meats ( lamb , steak and duck ) . the dishes were all generally well made and my favorites were definitely the sea urchin rice , brussel sprouts , sweet potato , duck and steak . the full porgy fish was a good size for a table of N and more cost efficient in my opinion than getting multiple smaller fish dishes . ( my huge fear here would be that i get a N- N full sized fish that was the size of a dollar pancake . . . but the porgy was the right size ) . the flavors of the food weren ' t strong but everything was fresh in my opinion . overall the vibe was pretty and the servers were very helpful , though i did feel slightly hustled into ordering more than what i originally planned on . . . but it was an overall good amount . would come back for special occasions or a need for an interesting dining experience . 
i ordered sweet potato tempura and a pina colada slushie . the best thing about this meal was the free water . the slushie tasted like detergent - no lie . it was a distinctly soapy taste ( i ' ve tasted soap before ) that remained on my tongue after the meal . i complained to a waiter , who brought another waiter who asked if i would like something different . i had no time , so i told them no . they did not offer to take it off my bill and ended up charging me for that . it was something i barely sampled ( the cup was still full ) and tasted awful . the service was mediocre at best . for the most part , after placing my order , the waiters ignored me . the waiters had enough time on their hands to loiter around the floor . when they brought the bill , they did not even bring me a pen to put down the tip amount with . i tipped them N of the part of the meal that was edible . to their credit , the sweet potato tempura was decent - not spectacular and not horrible . i ' m rating this as a N instead of N because of the tempura and the water . 
its ok for a local place , that ' s about it . spent a couple of hundred there and no buy backs , next time they get no tip ! 
- exceptional vegetarian food - very fresh ingredients - variety of menu that ' s not overwhelming - large beverage selection - friendly staff but they seem to take about half the year off . reminds me of julius gold in good at gold . so , if they ' ve open they ' re closed saturdays . . . ) do it ! you will feel good after . i always get the large falafel sandwich , it fills me up . 
although the head waitress seems to sometimes have her attitude problems , there ' s honestly no reason to ever ask any questions . lets take the stuffed tomatoes and peppers for example . they are categorized as a vegetarian dish , so you know you ' re not gettin any meat . also in its description it also says that it is stuffed with rice and herbs ! the menu really does explain a lot . although reading the online menu might not be of much help . 
of all the spots in philly for two out of towners to land on a saturday night , my buddy i hit the jackpot ! for a couple of N somethin ' married guys this place has " danger will robinson , danger ! ! " written all over it . ) i had the meatloaf dinner which i devoured in about N min . . . and instead of just having our N drinks hitting another spot , thanks to rory the bartender upstairs we stayed for a few hours ! he was awesome ! ! . . . as the night progressed it got a bit crowded , but we hung in there . . . met a few " meatheads " but the ladies we met made the time fly by ! thanks rory ! ! had a great time ! ! we ' ll be back ! ! one-eyed mike
so there is a running theme to all my reviews N . i love meat . N . i love overly indulging myself and going home to sit al bundy style on the couch . N . i love free food . so , here i am , at another pharmaceutical paid-for dinner . . . let me start with the greasy , way too rich bread that was sitting on the table . i ate one . i was trying to pace myself . i would have eaten more if i did not realize what was coming ahead . . . onto the salad bar . dude , there is no way i would pay N to only have the salad bar . but it ' s still pretty darn good . and fresh ! like , i don ' t think i saw a single piece of wilted vegetable in the entire spread . and what a lovely spread it was . bonuses of prosciutto and parmesan . and awesome marinated mushrooms . then came on the meats . in the words of rachel zoe , d-i-e ! i think i tried every cut of beef ( who wants to waste time with less artery clogging stuff ? ) . . . the garlicky top sirloin and filet . . . the ribeye wasn ' t bad either . . . or there was the bacon-wrapped meat . . . i am salivating again just thinking about it . dessert was fabulous as well . i am a total sucker for flan . the chocolate cake is amazing . . . so is the cheesecake . so i won ' t take any stars away , but i seriously thought i was going to die by the time i got home . i ' m sorry , i have no willpower . and when servers keep coming around with meat ( and i sure as hell wasn ' t going to miss anything by turning my card over to the red side ! ) . . . i can ' t say no . that ' s quite the story of my life , isn ' t it ? ? 
the food is as good as the service . their are a lot of other diners on the highway but none have that home town feel and comfort like this place . 
blown away by the food , great experience overall . 
we were N for dinner . we went to basso because of the reviews in menupages . and we loves everything that came to the table . the host was charming and helpful . freebies of olives , etc . were terrific . atmosphere is warm , contemporary . we heartily recommend basso and will go back soon . 
looking for a great deal and a delicious meal ? look no further . the N lunch special is phenomenal . really truly a great deal with lots of selections for every taste . i had the tofu salad to start . a deliciously fresh salad with crunchy veggies , tofu and a lovely peanut dressing . the other diner had the dumplings which were fresh and hot . our entrees - pho bo and mixed vegetable stir fry - were both great . don ' t miss this place if you are looking for a pre-theater lunch spot . 
the food was great . went there for the first time earlier this month for a friend ' s birthday . the employees are very friendly , and the place ' s atmosphere is just great
for N combo plate , and being open at N am on a monday night alone , these guys deserve a N star rating ! everything on the plate is diced up in bits , so it was very digestable , especially if you are drunk ! the hot sauce is hot , but good for the cold weather . and don ' t " faget " to put the white cream yogurt sauce all over the plate ! best N spent in nyc ! 
this place is not a secret , but i loved feeling like i was a part of one for an evening . my date led me down a dark alley to this rustic , cottage-like house . the door opened up into a warmly-lit , friendly restaurant , with two bars and a wait list . we were actually seated pretty quickly and had a pleasant , albeit cozy ( tight ) evening . i forget what i had , but it was great , and the drinks were good , too . 
after a so-so valentine ' s day meal at a high end philadelphia eatery , we were really looking forward to something more friendly and finger licken ' good on saturday night . so we headed to n . Nrd on north Nrd and brown in northern liberties , where once again , it did not disappoint ! we got there about Npm to find the place really hopping . this place has a crowded bar room at the entrance , which leads to a dining room just one step up , which leads to a second dining room which also has a bar . the front bar is the larger of the two . the bartenders do a great job of mixology along with lots of beer specials from the tap and the bottle . they also have wine and cocktail specials . the atmosphere of the place is hip and friendly with most of the patrons being young , but there are always people of all ages . we were seated in the back room at a table for two by the hostess who also gave us the menu . excellent service is always the rule at n . Nrd and so it began almost immediately with water being served . our waiter ( ben ) came by , and remembering that my wife enjoyed dark robust beer , brought her a small sample of one that he thought she might like , and also suggested one other . he also remembered that i like lemon with my water , and without having to ask for it , the lemon slices promptly appeared at the table . n . Nrd ' s menu is varied with great apps , salads , soups , bar food , sandwiches and entrees . there are always specials of the day on a separate menu and they are also posted on a couple of blackboards . so , after reading the specials , we decided on a tuscan kale salad made with grapefruit , avocado , toasted almonds , goat cheese and red onion in champagne honey vinaigrette , which all marinated deliciously together . for our entrees , my wife choose the pan seared fluke with scallops , with a green pea-barley risotto in white wine and truffle oil . i chose a pepper crusted ny strip steak with roasted potatoes , fennel , rosemary , saut ed pea leaves , in a green peppercorn gravy . both of these entrees were really wonderful . we finished the meal with homemade chocolate bread pudding topped with ice cream . so good ! ! so , if you want a really good meal , served by a very good and friendly wait staff , head to n . Nrd . i am pretty sure you won ' t be disappointed . 
i ' m a portland raised lobster freak and have been eating rhlp lobster rolls every sunday since day one at dumbo . they do rock and in my own new england redneck opinion , they are the best thing i ' ve eaten outside my home state . i ' m not a hater but the yapping lobster lady under the bridge was testing my patience and loyalty and i ' m glad to know i ' m not the only one who feels that way . i was happy to see the tent today in my barrio of ft . greene and was even happier not to see lady langosta holding up the line . but i guess she left her son in charge which was painfully obvious because he was her , only in the form of a twenty-something year old boy who was working at half the speed of her chefs who are always on point with a genuine smile and an educated answer . still , through all the drama and waiting , its the best maine lobster roll around ! 
finally got to come here after having traif bookmarked for so long . my boyfriend normally has the same reaction each time when i tell him i want " tapas " . he ' s not really the biggest fan of anything food and small related . anywho , came in pretty late and were one of two tables left , but we were waited on by a friendly server , one that didn ' t seem to be annoyed at how late in the night we came in . we were given small complimentary sweet potato soups that were delicious ! we started with bbq short rib sliders and the baked muenster cheese and chorizo small plates . both were amazing ! decent portions for the " small plates " that they were . i ordered the lobster risotto and my boyfriend , another pasts dish that i can ' t remember ( and that was just that , they were unfortunately forgettable . for desert , the bacon dulce de leche donuts were to die for . we also received a small complimentary plate of sliced strawberries with a pomegranate molasses sauce that i wanted to lick off the plate . too bad for manors . all in all , although we were dissapointed with our main dishes , the experience as a whole makes me give traif a solid N stars and i can ' t wait to come back . 
one of the best new restaurants i ' ve tried this year . i really enjoyed every dish we had which happens infrequently . this is a great neighborhood restaurant as well as one worth travelling for . i loved all the asian ingredients and components in each dish . i thought every dish was well balanced . . . you can taste the ingredients but none were overpowering . amuse-bouche - i like the fine dining touch without having to go to a fine dining establishment . the papaya salad and tomatoes was a lovely little bite with just enough fish sauce to taste but not turn pungent . oxtail spring rolls - two cigar-like rolls with crispy , golden skin . the meaty oxtail and cumin flavors came through and the bone marrow added richness . the green dipping sauce was fresh and almost palate cleansing . octopus - yes , the octopus was tender . but what i really loved was the pork xo and brown butter fingerling foam . the pork xo flavor was spot on and provided crispy little nuggets of texture . while most foams are airy and disappear , the texture of the fingerling foam coats the tongue so you can taste the buttery goodness . we scraped every bit off the plate . pig out for two - this dish is not as overwhelming as it may appear in pictures . the pork cubes are not as large in person but are still very satisfying . for N , it ' s worth it because it comes with a filling bowl of noodles for each person . as comparison , other entrees range N- N depending on the current menu . the berkshire pork was tender and juicy with crispy skin . the ginger scallion sauce sambal sauce were great condiments to put on each bite of pork . i usually have ginger scallion sauce with boiled chicken rice dishes i get in chinatown bbq places , so this was a new pairing for me to have it with pork . and it was just as delicious . the spicy peanut noodles has a nice level of heat and is not lacking in peanuttiness . and the fresh persimmon arugula salad was pretty and helped balance the rich flavors of the pork and noodles . the menu notes the pig out is limited quantity and i ' m not sure how often or when they sell out . but there were a lot of orders for this dish . ( we got there at N N on sat . for a walk-in party of N . ) corn side dish - the kaffir lime and curry were so delicious with the corn . it is a very good sized portion for a side at N considering the quality of food here . definitely recommend this . seriously a delicious meal . 
bistecca restaurant is located inside the embassy suites hotel in parsippany , nj . it ' s not necessarily cheap , but if you ' re living in the hotel on an extended stay like i am , it ' s worth either going downstairs or ordering room service . i ' ve tried most of the items off the menu ( they offer large portions ) and can recommend their salads , crispy calamari , pepper crusted steak , and pasta dishes . 
i ' ve been here twice now and if you ' re into fusion indo-chinese , this place is great . the spices they use must be locally imported or homemade as you can taste the bold flavors with ease and gratitude ( we shared some chili and garlic flavored meat and fish ) . the bar is also stacked with all the usual culprits , including the full range of macallans , johnny and chivas . i will definitely be back ! 
if you don ' t already know , their burgers are huge and delicious . curly fries are a must and basically open N hours , N days a week . this is a win people ! must try meow
love soonja ' s . keeps getting better with age . very versatile with something on the menu for everyone . dragon roll is one of the best around . recently , had bibimbap with tofu in hot stone pot-- excellent . ( portion so generous i couldn ' t finish . ) friend had pad thai with chicken . prices are reasonable , esp . for princeton . great place to take extended family and friends from out-of-town . 
had the pulled duroc pork sandwich . nothing really wowed me ' bout it . very similar to a vietnamese sandwich but with a different spread on the bread . kinda pricey for a dainty baguette sandwich though . now that i ' ve tried this place , i think i ' ll stick with the vietnamese sandwich joints i know love ( bigger sandwiches , better meats , cheaper ) . no thank you , not again . 
just one word yummy ! 
it was tough finding a place to eat in soho because there are do many different places . we decided to eat here because we were in the mood for italian . the place is pretty cool inside and we sat in the back . there ' s a skylight so it feels pretty open . one thing that thought was weird was that there was an hour and a half " eating limit " . i guess because it was a friday night and we didn ' t have a reservation ? anyway we didn ' t plan on staying long so that wasn ' t a big deal . the menu was okay , we looked around at food on other people ' s tables and it looked really good . i ordered the carbonara pasta and my boyfriend got the vodka pasta . we felt pretty rushed when ordering . we didn ' t really get to discuss if we wanted an appetizer or not before the server came back to take our order , so we just ordered entrees . the food came out really fast and it was good . it wasn ' t anything to yell about . i ' ve had better pasta dishes elsewhere . the portion sizes were small based on the pricing , but then again we were in new york city so we figured that was normal . also , they charge for refills on iced tea , which is annoying . so we each had two iced teas , four total and two entrees and it came to about N with the tip for the server . a little pricy but the food was good . overall , it was a good place to grab some pasta , just a little bit pricy . 
my dinner experience was actually better than brunch . . although you ' ve got to be ready to pay a prettier penny food is just okay . . there ' s just a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant dinner is on the expensive side for a such a casual restaurant . . . but i liked our seating in the little booth in a nook at the back of the restaurant ! --starter serving of kale salad overrated . . i ' ve had better kale salads . . this was a tough one to chew --braised greens a yummy side --duck fat fries overhyped . . --roasted chicken so juicy good . . this was the winning dish of the night i never even think to order chicken at restaurants --chicken liver mousse not bad --flatbread nothing special brunch requires a wait but i think we were seated in N hour --french toast with a side of bacon just okay --corned beef hash again i ' m just not sure what the hype is
the food is awesome . so into that marrow starter . and dont skip dessert . hello , s ' mores in a jar . but i am yelping because of the cinnamon fizz cocktail . i can not stop thinking about it . it may be the best drink in the city i kid you not . i take my cocktails very seriously . 
one of the best greek restaurants in nyc . there is not one thing on the menu that will let you down . the only negative about this place is that it doesn ' t take reservations and the wait to be seated is extremely long . . . but it ' s worth it . 
da marcella is an unpretentious , cozy italian restaurant on houston . the service was warm and friendly , like walking into a family-owned restaurant ( which i suspect is what it is . ) this is one of those places where even if you are entering for the first time , you get greeted like you are their most loyal customer . the meals were good and hearty , and for less than N , it really was quite the deal . i liked the spaghetto cacio e pepe , but i think i will try something different the next time--it didn ' t quite have the zesty taste of other cacio e pepe dishes i have had . it wasn ' t bad , however , and it was very fresh . my wife ' s tagliatelle alla bolognese was better--she was very happy with her meal . while i think i ' ll order differently the next time , i certainly was not disappointed . the place is warm , friendly and unassuming , with good food at a great price . 
miles table makes a mean turkey burger . i found myself ordering at this new american food restaurant on south street last week after meandering up and down the block , checking out prospective dinner options . and there are so many options on this block . i love that about my neighborhood , but i suppose that , sometimes , i just want a dang burger . plus , the inside looks really cute and cozy , even from the street . i ordered my burger to go and chatted with two members of the really upbeat and friendly staff while i waited . a dad and his kid were dining up front where there is a framed poster of a cute baby hamming it up in a pot . during a rather quiet moment in the room , the child exclaimed " do you cook babies ? ! " . kids dine for free on tuesdays . my burger and fries were perfection . the burger itself was flavorful , cooked just right , and the bun housed it well , all airing on the side of " generous " in portion . the fries were salted and flavored in a way where they didn ' t need ketchup , which is always pretty nice , in my opinion . the rest of the menu looked quite good as well , but i ' ve definitely found my burger place ! i ' d love to return for breakfast and sit in that cozy booth in the front . 
great food , great service . went with the wife and kids . i got the scallop ravioli , my wife got the linguini with clam sauce , son got veil parm , daughter got chicken alfredo . all of these dishes were great . very generous portions . we brought a lot home . 
my all-time favorite brunch spot with a potential death row meal ( moroccan benedict ) . the brooklyn location is bright and beautiful and i ' ve never waited longer than N minutes for a table . mogodor hits the trifecta of great food , fantastic service and amazing vibe ( i leave that for you to decipher but eye candy is ridiculous ) . make sure to ask for the hot sauce ! 
reasonably prices , great sushi . i am a born and raised new yorker who gives this place N stars . 
this place is aptly named . prosperity for the man who runs it and prosperity for those of us lucky enough to come across it . this is a recession-proof deal . my friend and i were really looking for a no-frills place to hang out but when we saw only four stools inside we nearly left . fortunately , i already had blisters on one toe from crisscrossing chinatown for the perfect discovery an inexpensive place with great food , barely discovered by outsiders , and yet clean . dive-y in a cool way , but not a dive . haute cuisine on a budget . well , prosperity dumpling had all the requirements mentioned above and even went beyond our expectations . the dumplings i had ( the steamed not the fried ) were some of the tastiest i ever had . and the portion ! i couldn ' t believe my eyes . ten , huge dumplings for two bucks ! the sesame cake , which is really a kind of bread laced with chives and topped with lots of seeds was insanely delicious , and only N cents ! i mean , where can you get anything for N cents ? this place is a throwback to another era . we also had delicious hot and sour soup for only N . N , for the large . the soup was , by far , one of the best hot and sour soups i have had anywhere in town . and , believe me , i am a hot and sour soup freak . we started eating and talking at a little after four , and had not noticed several hours go by . the place started swarming with people , going in and out . mostly , they took their goodies to go . lucky for us , because four stools or not , we were determined to hang out among all this deliciousness . the place even had an ambiance . it reminded me of being somewhere entirely foreign and somewhat exotic . loved everything here and plan to return . btw , we closed the place down and we were literally asking if there was anything else we could have . no , he was closed , the chinese man with the broken accent said . but , he still had one more surprise . fifty dumplings for only N . N ! he instructed me to bring the water to a boil , and then put the dumplings in for about six minutes . i dined on them almost all week , and i still have ten of them left ! i suggest salting the water slightly when you boil , and then adjust to taste with soy sauce . if you like things spicy , like me , a few drops of tabasco sauce will transform these into a heavenly snack or a whole meal , depending on how many you eat . btw , when you put the steamed dumplings in your mouth , the explode with juices . joe ' s shanghai , you better watch out ! 
going to visit your son in philly requires the cheesesteak thing so where better to get the immersion experience than passyunk ave where you find both geno ' s and pat ' s . we chose pat ' s . the fare is about typical pcs which is as good as that specialty gets , but the other fun feature of the visit was the faux abuse we get when the order taker detects our southern accents when we say " wit " indicating the inclusion of onions and white cheese . of course we have to counter abuse back which results in the employee coming out to join us during his break and have a big time joking around . all in all a memorable time at an iconic american fast foodery and the steak was as good as any . 
the food here is very good . when the weather is nice there is an eating area outdoors . we had pizza , pasta and an eggplant parm hero all were very good . i would recommend and will be going back . i only gave N stars because the restaurant itself needs an update . 
absolutely fantastic ! i went there for the eggplant parmigiana , but the waiter convinced me to try the veal and eggplant . against his recommendation , i also ordered a side of linguine bolognese . . . how can you not eat pasta at a place like this ? i ate until i hurt and then took three more bites ! did not come close to finishing , but i sure tried . they specialize in family style but they will serve single guest . the portions are substantial and the the quality is great . very friendly and helpful waiter . my water glass never quite got empty and the food came out quick and hot . i will definitely be back . 
a nice cocktail selection with extremely friendly service . how did i end up landing on an average rating ? everything else just seems so nondescript and average . the giant tv type wall in the back seems out of place , as if it was there before and they didn ' t feel the need to adjust . the menu , while offering some unique items , falls short . my advice is to pass on the chickpea fries . the prices , again while not out of line , are far from a bargain . the cocktails are really good and it is fun to watch them be prepared . try to grab a seat at the bar . i enjoyed my " N year plan " and the taste i had of the bodhisattva . be prepared , the bodhisattva is thick . ask for advice if you aren ' t quite sure , the servers and bartenders know their drinks well . enjoy more than one and you might be convienced to ramp up the rating . 
 ( N . N stars ) i ' m hot and cold on this place . here ' s what ' s hot donkey and goat wines on tap for N a glass ( the couple times i went they had the N carignane and the mourv dre - both are legit and if you don ' t know about this winery , get on it . also , generally speaking , when wines are on tap they are cheaper for you . N is a solid price for these babies ) . the food - amongst us we had the kale salad ( N , with anchovies , hazelnuts , pecorino ) the roasted red beets ( N , with pistachios , orange bits , and a little ricotta ) and the classic burger ( N , a little small , but solid , with crispy fries ) and all were delicious and i think on point for price . the menu has quite the range , with many options for a small bite , sharing plates , or a big , full meal . though they are banking on it with the name of the place , it ' s not the best burger in nyc ( where is that anyway ? ! ) , but it ' s good and satisfying . the atmosphere - it feels a little too perfect , but ultimately it ' s cozy and inviting . the location - yeah , soho ' s a little lame , but it ' s almost directly across from the angelika . bonus for the roger ebert in you . here ' s what ' s not the atmosphere - yup , a repeat . okay , it might be a little too polished for a place that supposedly specializes in burgers and things from a barrel . the whiskey - is this where the barrel part comes in ? because they ' ll need to augment their selection a tad and , um , that old fashioned they made me with bulleit rye was not worth N ( they have an extensive cocktail menu , with drinks averaging N a simple whiskey drink should not be more expensive ) . ( the drinks on their menu were okay though ) . the beer - wait , is this where the barrel part comes in ( i think part of their slogan is beer by the barrel ) ? almost every beer is good , but definitely not exciting . i want to be excited by my beer , guys ! the signature shooters - they have a few but the most egregious is the shot of whistle pig with a can of pork slap for N . that ' s a signature rip-off ( and whistle pig should be sipped and enjoyed slowly , not annhiliated ) . they also allow you to put bourbon in your milkshake . please , for the love of kentucky , please do not put bourbon in your milkshake . 
this is my place for lunch . 
so good that i went here N times during my N day stay in new york . ok . . . it was only a N minute walk from where i was staying but still ! ! ! it was well worth that N minute walk each time . i had their speciality pizza the first time , the spinach artichoke . i have never encountered another pizza like it . unique and so delicious , it ' s a must try . but while you absolutely have to try this pizza , i would recommend you share it with someone . the pizza slices here are huge and to be honest , the pizza is so rich that you really can ' t have any more than N or N bites without feeling overwhelmed . my favorite pizza here is the margherita . unlike the spinach artichoke , it ' s light and almost airy . the thin crust went perfectly with the pizza , allowing you to fully enjoy the flavors of every ingredient . so in summary , try the spinach artichoke but come back for the margherita ! 
great food , wine and atmosphere ! we tried the tri-pasta , chicken with peas and asparagus and ended up with the samplers desserts , loved it ! 
i hate salmon , but the salmon pizza is awesome ! 
totally don ' t understand the reviews of this place . we went based on yelp , which is generally a good idea . portions were good , but dishes were mediocre and not worth the money the food was so extremely salty i eventually could no longer bear to continue with the meal . when i reported the excess salt to the curious waiter as to why i did not enjoy my experience he dispatched a tall female maitre ' d who was the rudest human i have ever encountered in the hospitality industry . interacting with her alone is enough to put me off s amp h kebab house for life , so it ' s lucky the food is far from desirable . avoid this place at all costs . 
i loved everything about this place . from the food , to the awesome space , to the lounge up front . the restaurants main dining hall gives some kind of courtyard feel to it , a lively area with high ceilings and nice decor . the gallotos appetizer for two is really an entree for two if desired . the yuca fries were bleh , bread was sooo good . large selection of sangria , and beer to add to the theme of the place . a fun dining experience , but for inconsistent service and some untastey sides , N . N . 
i ' ve been ordering from this restaurant for about N or N years now . everything is deivered to my home . the delivery person is very prompt and courteous . the quality of food is excellent and beyond criticism . i spent time in china when i was in the u . s , navy and sing ' s kitchen is as close to the what is served there as one can get . the other chinese cuisine restaurants in west haven " . . . just don ' t have it " and never did . there was a a very good restaurant on orange ave . , ( good fortune ) but they are long gone . sing ' s kitchen duplicates or exceeds their authentic quality . take it from me . . . i ' ve tried them all both in china and here , and sing ' s kitchen is the absolute best . 
i ' m updatin to four stars as this place has corrected the most serious problems with their menu , but the menu is still over-sweet and over-rich , really there is so much sugar flowing out of this place from the menu to the taps it ' s a diabetes factory , but it ' s up to you to handle your nutrition - local saturated fats and simpe sugars are still those things , local doesn ' t automatically mean healthy . putting a couple of pieces of kale next to N calories of saturated fats doesn ' t make it healthy . but still , in the tiny market of burlington your options for actually good tasting food on an actually nutritious menu is very limited and when found as expensive as this place . these are ownership mgmt problems . the people who work there and the service is about the best you ' lll find in any college town , and the staff are super super friendly . extra star for you ! 
 N . N for ( N ) four little fish sticks ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? shame on me for not looking at the downloadable menu with the prices . is the rent too damn high ? it was tasty but still . . . 
i ' m staying in the area for a month for work and a friend suggested i check out knife , it ' s literally half a block from where i am . i was expecting it to be good . . . but lemme say it ' s really good ! i ' ve been in N times and have had the same thing each time . i order the thai wonder ( a transcendent tofu thing which for some reason is a challenge for many ) and a kalenoa salad ( kale-noa . . . kale and quinoa , get it ? ) . zomg . the tofu on the thai wonder is medium soft and perfect . not a hard puck like so many and not so soft it turns into tofutti spread , it ' s the perfect consistency and directly seasoned which i really appreciate . the kale salad is very good . i mean it ' s kale salad , they didn ' t invent it and they ' re not revolutionizing the concept with their kalenoa but it ' s quite tasty and a good size . i " m a sucker for dried apricots also and this salad is studded with them . bonus points . prices here are fine and i actually enjoy the coffee contrary to some other reviews . super friendly staff too . recommended . 
this place deserves N stars . applause . 
brunch at cafe habana is so yummy . my friend and i ate at the bar and enjoyed bloody marys and screwdrivers along with the chilaquiles and the cuban sandwich , both with sides of rice and beans . delish ! loved everything about our experience here . the only tiny shocker ( which actually i should expect by now living in nyc ) is the price tag when drinks are ordered . . . but the awesome bartender actually gave us a round on the house , which lightened the blow a bit . very pleased with cafe habana . 
for such a crazy reputation it was decent . pancakes were solid , not the best i ' ve ever had , good fruit and great syrup . . . helped that i had a fresh squeezed oj screwdriver . decent bacon on my biscuit sandwich . was not floored . but to be fair i wasn ' t feeling N , if give it another try . . . next time ill go very very hungry . 
yummy ! finally went here when visiting my parents outside of philly . this is true jersey pie and to find out it ' s the inspiration for our favorite ocean city , nj pizza ( mack and manco ' s ) makes it even better . pizza was perfectly thin and crusty - with simple toppings it was just amazing . i had the tomato pie with spinach and garlic and could not stop eating it . 
so freaking good . try to get here before the rush . small parties of two are your best bet here since they put different people at a N person table . the turn around here is quick . the waiter asks you right when they seat you if you want the xlb . just say yes because you do . i really like the pork dumplings . the skin stuck to my lips a bit but the soup was sooooooo yummy two orders of xlb and scallion pancakes and you ' re full for a pretty good price . totally a must go here . 
for a meal , it ' s not the worst choice , but not too many options and generally on the loud side . still a decent place , though . i stopped by with three friends on a weekday evening , and we enjoyed drinks over several smaller plates . amongst the house ricotta , pulled pork paratha , meatballs , tuna tartar guac , and the mac and cheese , the paratha and the ricotta were probably my favorites , but the others were generally run of the mill in terms of flavor and preparation . combined with the general loudness of the venue , it made it a bit difficult to hold conversation . probably wouldn ' t return for a meal , but it ' s probably a decent place to stop by for a drink or two with friends . 
great place ! excellent food and ambience . totally recommend it . 
hated it ! will never go back . . . i work for a very prestigious law firm in the area and tonight we took out a co-worker for her last day . what a mistake ! i had never been to the village whiskey before , but heard all about their burgers and duck fries so we gathered there to see what all the hype was about . we started out at the bar but since they had so many empty tables , we asked to be seated at two of them so we could all sit and eat together . the miserable door girl was reluctant to do so because she thought there were too many of us , but she sat us anyway . she then rudely reminded us that we had to order food to sit there . she gave us a dirty look every time she walked by our table . it was unbelievable . on the flip side , our waiter was very nice , but unfortunately we didn ' t see him very often . we actually had to call him over to our table to order more drinks and food every N-N minutes . it was ridiculous . the food was good , not great . everyone seemed to enjoy their burger the most . duck fries were boring and i ' ve had better fried shrimp . the hostess seemed to be happy when we asked for our check and even had something sarcastic to say about it . overall , the staff was not courteous , rude , and neglectful in service to their patrons . it ' s a shame the owner doesn ' t know how his establishment is run because they would all be looking for jobs ! never again ! 
food is great and excellent customer service is also great . we had a great time . we are also excited about friday karaoke ! ! we will be back . i ' m peruvian and my guy is italian and we both loved it . we had been to a location in montclair and both places are out of this world . we will be back . we are a fan of the ceviche as an app and we go from there . lack of decor in actual dinning area but that wont stop us from returning . loved the food ! 
fabulous ! ! gluten free pizza was awesome with the best crust i ' ve had in a long time . i ' m pretty sensitive to gluten , and they were great - and i didn ' t even get sick ! definitely recommended ! ! ! 
worst thing about this place is waiting to be seated . we had to wait an hour and we went at N . fortunetly we live a block away so it was no bother . we got back and had to wait another N mins so had a drink at the bar . the women at reception are not very friendly . drinks were N bucks for coke N for beer . . . . not bad . the restaurant is very cool insdie , good vibrant atmosphere . . . the noodles are great and only N bucks for extra . def worth a visit . dont go on wkds u will have a long wait and they dont accept bookings . staff inside are very nice and food is good
great food , although the portions are misleadingly small - i would have thought that for N the dishes would have been entree sized rather than small plate . if you ' ve got enough money though , get N dishes per person and you will be very happy with the tasty food . 
black bamboo has been an impressive establishment since the day it opened its doors . i frequent the restaurant several times a week and have never been disappointed in the service or the remarkable quality of the food and its presentation . the owner " sonny " makes it a personal point to endear himself to his patrons and build personal relationships with all of his regulars . the food offerings are creative , fresh and delicious and the portions ensure that nobody leaves hungry and wanting for more . the pricing is the most reasonable around . i really enjoy this restaurant , the staff , the intimate atmosphere and always leave satisfied and looking forward to my next visit . it is amazing to me that this is a family run operation and that it is their first attempt at restaurant ownership . you would think they had been doing this for decades . i suggest that you treat yourself to a visit to black bamboo , to experience first hand the vast menu and impeccable delivery . there is also a large selection of vegan items on the menu that you must try . excellent service , excellent food and consistently excellent experiences . i am sure that you will become a fan on your first visit . scott s . 
count me as a big fan of this new restaurant . i love almost all new haven restaurants , but the kitchen table stands out . it ' s unique in its commitment to sustainable food--which translates into tastier , fresher ingredients . it also gave us the warm , fuzzy feeling that we were eating pesticide-free food at a place that supports local farmers . i went to the kitchen table with a large group--there were N of us--and we rented out the entire restaurant . the waiters are a bit tough to spot in a crowded restaurant because they don ' t wear uniforms , but their casual attire made the entire place feel homier , as did the fact that every plate is a different design . the freakishly tall chef--seriously he ' s pushing N feet--greeted us , explained his hopes for the restaurant , and summarized the night ' s menu . the food ( and there was a ton of it ) was served family-style , which i think is great . here were the dishes N ) the bread yummmmm ! they served a variety of breads , a real hodgepodge cinnamon scones , cranberry scones , a pretzel-like bread , standard rolls , and sliced bread . but everyone at my table basically ate butter , with a side of bread , since the garlic and honey butters were so tasty . N ) apple , red potato , and leek soup with polenta croutons wow . another big hit . the soup was thick and , unexpectedly , a bit spicy . if i were to make any suggestions , i ' d say less salt and more apple , but really , why tamper with perfection . N ) farm-raised chicken with a kiwi riesling sauce awesome . after i finished the chicken , which was nice and moist , i was still eating the leftover sauce--very tasty with just a tinge of kiwi . N ) mussels completely average , but would be excellent with a bit more butter . on the positive side , the mussels weren ' t ocean-raised , but raised on a string apparently ( i didn ' t catch everything the giant chef said ) , which i suppose makes them healthier than your average , everyday mussel . N ) shitaki mushroom risotto i ' ve got high standards for risotto , and so i was a little disappointed with this one . the consistency was great , but it needed more flavor . after adding some salt , i did like it , and no one else at the table had any complaints . N ) potatoes with rosemary hearty , local potatoes . very fresh with strong seasoning . N ) skirt steak oh . . . my . . . . god . i don ' t think it ' s an exaggeration to say that everyone at the table stopped talking and was just kinda dumbfounded by how good this steak was . it was perfectly seasoned and cooked . order it ! N ) winter veggies so winter vegetables aren ' t the tastiest veggies out there , but still . the kitchen table is apparently going to rotate the vegetables they serve based on what ' s locally available and fresh , which is awesome . so here here kitchen table for serving weird root-like vegetables that i don ' t know the names of ! N ) the booze there ' s a good variety of beers , the house wines were standard , but the margarita was a little lacking . dessert time N ) flourless chocolate cake with pomegranate rich , very dry , but nice and simple . N ) cr me brulee good ! someone at my table protested that it wasn ' t very traditional , but who cares ! ? it was so yummy . N ) vanilla cake with raspberry filling big meh . totally standard vanilla cake ( almost like a birthday cake ) with a overly sweet raspberry filling . hope this is helpful ! enjoy ! 
bruno ' s stinks ! that really does sum it up . i ' ve been there a couple of times , and i think their sicilian pie is great , but recently went for lunch with the wife . i got a sausage and peppers that was a real joke - seriously , you call it a sandwich ? ? ! ! she had a sandwich that had so much salt added to it , it was hardly edible . then one of the workers decided to go stand at the front door , keep it open and let all the smoke from his cigarette come blowing back in with the wind . no thanks - what a dump ! have had their neopolitan pie also , and that is nothing to rave about - go somewhere else ! 
by far the best ramen i ' ve had in nyc . i ' m not a ramen expert or anything , but i can distinguish between a basic bowl of broth and noodles and a hearty , flavorful , delicious , steaming bowl of ramen . yes , there seems to be a rivalry between ippudo and totto ramen and i ' ve had the ( mis ) fortune of waiting more than an hour for each . totto ramen is a hole in the wall - there are maybe N or N small tables and the bar , so yes you will definitely be waiting for awhile . i went on a sunday night and waited almost an hour and a half with two other friends ( so a total of N people ) . at one point a party of N was called , but was told they could either go in an split into two groups or wait longer for a table of N , so keep in mind this is not the place to go with large groups . however , the ramen was absolutely delicious ! i had the totto spicy ramen and it was so good . they have a bunch of chili peppers to indicate the spiciness level , but really they give you some ( what i think is ) chili oil and chili paste to toss into your ramen . essentially you can control how spicy you want it , but if you ' re a fan of nose-running deliciousness , toss it all in ! really , it wasn ' t that bad at all . thankfully for the other people waiting , you are in and out of the restaurant in about N-N minutes . the service is quick and it shouldn ' t take you too long to down that bowl of ramen . in short , definitely give totto ramen a try ( it ' s better than ippudo in my opinion ) but be prepared to wait ! 
we had tried many ippudo and hakata ippudo ny still the best ramen in ny . but we had to wait N min before get a table . but worth to wait . the ramen not much in a portion . but taste very good . its consistency in ramen amazing . but the pork meat is too dry . we liked it more moist and still had fat attach . . . . 
this place just isn ' t rustic enough . or twee enough . and the lights could be dimmer . and i can pronounce all the cocktails on the menu ( lame ) . idk maybe i ' m a purist . 
i haven ' t had a very good solid bowl of ramen in some time ( haven ' t been to ippudo in years ) , and the other local options weren ' t really weren ' t doing the job . i had heard about how mu ramen previously had a pop-up but never had a chance . the hype was building up for this place before i got here , and was prepared to eat N bowls if it was the real deal . here ' s the breakdown . tonkotsu N . N - i always envision a tonkotsu being very fatty , thicker , with a rounded out flavor . mu ' s tonkotsu was as not as fatty as i was used to , however , it was very well balanced and flavorful . it was combined with thinner noodles which complemented it very well . sometimes ramen at other places can be underwhelming and bland , too salty , or overpowering , but this bowl at mu ramen had the right balance of flavor , noodle , and pork jowl . i gladly finished the entire broth , ready for another bowl . spicy miso ramen - this broth was extra hot , spicy but not too spicy , and a good , strong flavor . this ramen had thicker noodles than the other ramens here , which seemed appropriate . attention to detail the soup spoons are huge . really huge . and for such good broth , it ' s fitting . makes it much easier to finish the broth and to hold your noodles in . u i this appetizer seafood rice bowl , including uni , ikura , roasted nori , spicy tuna , wasabi , and sushi rice , was very good . it ' s served in a small rice bowl . i don ' t know if it ' s worth N , but it is really really good . it ' s definitely a winning appetizer for me . i could probably eat two of these . unipo i only tasted a small spoonful from my friend ' s bowl , but it wasn ' t my cup of tea . i guess i ' m not a fan of rice porridge ' s in general , even if you add shaved truffles and other quality ingredients . staff i definitely prefer mom pop or chef owned and managed places because there ' s so much extra attention and care . the co-owner heidy takes her time to welcome you to their shop and to explain all the dishes . everyone pitches in to serve the food , refill water glasses , etc . , even chef smookler . you can definitely feel their imprint on the place . that special touch is something a lot of places don ' t have in general . decor i normally don ' t really care how my ramen places look or feel , but mu ramen definitely made an effort to make this place feel relaxed and laidback . the reclaimed wood tables , benches , cool ceiling design and lighting , definitely a nice spot . also they had a nice mix of Ns hip hop and current music with a beat in the background . this was cash only , so definitely be prepared if you ' re ordering a whole bunch of appetizers and ramens . i got there at N minutes before the N N opening on a wednesday , and was the first group in line . however , the line slowly built up by N N . since i was the first one in , there were no complaints . however , possibly because it ' s a new spot and they want to treat each customer with care and respect , they only slowly filled up the seating . i can imagine the lines being pretty bad later at night with every group ordering various appetizers . as a general suggestion , not sure if they wanted to keep the place to a N seater , but it would be cool if they added bar seating to the side wall , though that would ruin the ambience , just a thought . final thoughts , i will definitely return time and time again . all ramen should be this good , just my N cents . finally found a close enough spot to frequent other than ippudo , special mitsuwa japanese food festivals , or japan . 
this past new year ' s eve marked our second dining experience at hot tomato ' s , the first being new year ' s eve a year ago ( N . N . N ) . we went with a group of people ( N , including N kids ) to dine and watch the hartford " first night " fireworks in bushnell park - great viewing from the venue ' s outdoor patio . last year , i was not impressed with the service , ambiance or food . however , after a closing and a change in ownership in N ( not sure which month ) , the establishment is back and it ' s much more impressive . thankfully our friends wanted to return , so we went acquiesced , and i ' m glad we did . like recent reviewers , we found the service to be outstanding , and believe me , we ' re a picky family . first up were drinks . i had the house old fashioned ( w makers ) . i ' m always surprised at how many places screw up what is an easy cocktail to make . the first one had the right mixture of bitters , orange and simple syrup -- perfect . however , the second round was not as good and was served in a highball glass . several other people went w various house martinis and found all to be well mixed . for apps , we selected the garlic bread ( loads of baked on cheese ) which was flavorful , firm and crispy - not overpowering and soggy which we ' ve found elsewhere . also , ordered the antipasto which came w quality prosciutto , parma , olives , peppers and such - big full plate for N . we also ordered a special applewood bacon wrapped scallops dish . the bacon was crisp and the scallops were meaty and moist -- not over or under cooked which can ruin the dish . i find that the bacon overpowers the scallops in this dish , but i love good bacon . entrees at the table included chopped salad w grilled chicken , brooklyn ragu ( basil tomato sauce over linguine ) , new york strip steak in a demi glaze , and two grilled pork chop specials . i was told the salad was very fresh and tasty . the steak was seared nicely and rested properly to seal in juices so that when cut , liquid did not flow all over the plate . the same was true of the pork chops , which were a hearty bone-in cut nearly N inches thick , and wonderfully glazed . the meat dishes came w grilled asparagus , also properly prepared . the kids went for the pasta , and the sauce was fresh , but a little bland for my taste , much more prefer a fra diavlo sauce . that said , the girl is a bit of a pasta snob and she found this dish to be very good . however , she did order it with meatballs and did not like them . i tasted them and found them to have too much filler - breadcrumbs -- in them . i would not recommend them . desert was limited to the italian tartufo , which everyone loved . however , i don ' t know if these were house-made or not , but they were good . overall , i ' d recommend the current version of hot tomato ' s -- good value for the price . enjoy . 
thursday night happy hour dj poon was amazing ! the food was decent . N for N pork dumplings wasn ' t a good deal to me especially when in any local chinese spot i can get N dumplings for N . . the atmosphere was great very " new york " . dimmed lights and trendy , fashionable patrons . 
what can i say about reading that everyone else hasn ' t said already . there are so many different options for food here that i just laugh when i see my friends drooling over the different options . dinic ' s is one of my favorite spots here for their famous roast pork sandwich . so juicy and succulent that i debate everyday whether to move to philly just for this sandwich . if you ' re around during the weekday , i would highly recommend trying out the amish market food in here as well ! when you ' re ready to relax , have a beer or eight at the beer garden in the middle . 
amazing ! ! ! ! love every thing in this place . great service ! keep it coming blue ribbon ! fried chicken are the boom ! ! ! 
the food poisoning and subsequent near death experience penelope gave me by eating their curried chicken salad renewed my appreciation of the simplicity in life that can escape you when you are too preoccupied by your busy schedule . after the violent body convulsing upheavals , cold sweats and panicked fear of asphyxiating on my own vomit came the moment of clarity that had been evading me as of recent . stress induced by work , the commuters you get stuck behind walking up the subway stairs , deadlines , expectations . . . none of that matters . perspective can come from unexpected places and my last dose came while desperately holding onto the toilet bowl , staring at the remnants of the half digested curried chicken salad that brought me to my knees . oh , and the decor was nice there . very quaint . hard to believe this little place is tucked away in midtown . renew your perspective on life . check this place out ! 
my friends and i went here expecting a good time and delicious food after hearing rave reviews from our coworkers . what we got , on the other hand , was far from any of our expectations . the server was unnecessarily rude and impatient as we took our sweet time debating on our entree meals , and afterwards , we had to wait about an entire decade for the food to arrive . i guess the bad service should have been expected . after all , our server couldn ' t even count . when all of us had finally arrived for our reservation , she said , " oh , you ' re still missing one , right ? there ' s only six . " in reality , there were seven of us . as i vaguely wondered if our server needed glasses ( even an elementary schooler could do the math ) , she tried to cover up her mistake by phonily complimenting my friend ' s dress . unfortunately for her , my friend wasn ' t wearing a dress . but we decided to ignore the mistake ( in hindsight , this should have been our second warning sign ) and place our orders . i ' ll admit , the ordering took a while , with our server having to come back several times to take down our entrees , but there was no need for her attitude . the minute we had finally placed our meals , she snarkily mumbled , " i ' ll just take these menus now before you all change your minds . " completely uncalled for . when our food finally came , after about a century and a half of waiting to the point where i was beginning to feel as though i had aged into a wrinkled old grandma , we found that the food was merely satisfactory . i think mc donald ' s would have been even better , and cheaper , considering the ridiculously expensive pricing of the food , which was only because of the large portions , one plate enough to feed a starved family of four living in the slums--not that they ' d want it , considering it was so bad . if i could describe it , the enchiladas were utterly tasteless , compared to taco bell or chipotle . the salad was a bunch of mixed leaves in a bowl , covered in what i ' m assuming was an expensive red sauce , and tasted quite bland and boring . but the worst part had yet to come . two of my friends , vegetarians , had ordered the " four cheese pasta , " making sure to tell our server , " no chicken . " can you guess what they got ? my friend slid over some of her pasta to share , and i gave it a go , thinking , " this isn ' t so bad , " until i noticed a large chunk of something that did not look at all like a block of cheese . i held my breath with dread . it couldn ' t be . scooping it into my mouth , i took a few chews . it didn ' t take a genius to recognize what it was chicken . it was my friend ' s birthday , for god ' s sake , and now for all we knew , her religion was probably telling her that she was going to hell . the server had one job . one job . i mean come off it now , really ? immediately , we complained to our server , and i made sure to confirm that it wouldn ' t be placed on the bill . our server , who i had been stupid enough to believe at the time , told me that she " would handle it " and everything would be all right . lying snake . i should have known better . telling us prior to ordering desserts that the birthday girl ' s slice would be " on the house " in compensation for the mistake , we were under the impression that the " four cheese pasta " would not be placed on the bill . little could we have been so very wrong . right smack dab on our bill , lo behold , the near twenty dollar plate of pasta that had freaking chicken in it for a couple of vegetarians . you have got to be kidding me . we tried to argue with our server , but she told us that the cheesecake " on the house " had been a kind gesture for the seventeen dollar pasta mistake on her part , which we now had to pay for . i don ' t know about you , but if i had known we were going to pay for a pasta plate my friends had barely even eaten , i would ' ve thrown that dish in her phony smiling face . when the manager came by to ask us how we were doing , we all politely said , " good , " and while i highly considered lashing out at how horrible our dinner had been , i held against it . there was no need to make a scene in the midst of those having a nice night ( though how that could be , i can hardly imagine ) . with the low quality food , expensive pricing , and bad service , i can confidently say i ' ve been converted into an absolute anti-fan of the cheesecake factory . i will never go here again it was a complete waste of my money and time . overall , i give the cheesecake factory one star ( out of complete generosity ) for the nice soap and cool hand drying machine in the bathroom . 
there seem to be a long line at artichoke pizza at all hours . why ? perhaps , they have great pizza ! long lines typically translate to good stuff right ? well , based on my experience - they give you a jumbo sized ( airbus aN ) like slice for under N dollars and maybe that ' s enough for some , but it didn ' t work on me . by the way , it could have been my slice , but there was maybe two small pieces of artichoke ? haha for the experience , if you are near-by why not give them a try , but good luck finding that artichoke on your pizza . 
i gotta say , the pizza here is just phenomenal . and walking across the bridge on a sunny day and queuing up for one of their pies is pretty close to perfection in terms of overall experiences . don ' t go overboard on the toppings , or you ' ll miss out on the deliciousness of the fresh mozz basil . pepperoni mushroom are my toppings of choice . the crust is burnt in an oddly pleasant way , and goes down smoother with olive oil ( which they bring out on request ) . and for under N N per topping it ' s a pretty good value . 
here is my first review for the dream sushi place ! ! ! the sushi was so tender and it melted in our month . we went there after watching the movie jiro dreams of sushi and sushi yasuda has met all of our high expectations . quote from the movie , " there are five attributes to a great chef N . take your work seriously N . aspire to improve N . maintain cleanliness N . be a better leader than a collaborator N . be passionate about your work . " -yamamoto , food critic the space was very warm , basic , and clean , yet very sophisticated . we asked for omakase and were very happy with the chief ' s selections . the eel came separately at the end and it was a nice surprise . i like fatty tuna the best . octopus was very interesting . . . the sushi was very simple and very tasty . omakase is N pieces for two people . we completed the dinner with mochi icecream and the brown rice tea . looking forward to going back , this time of course seating at the bar ) nimet
the food is simple , yummy and reasonably priced . loved the fresh fruit and zabaione . the pasta was also very undercooked to the point that it got cold and glued together like a hard noodle casserole . the restaurant was clean , relatively quiet and deceptively spacious -- looks a lot smaller than it is from the outside . the service was great , with very attentive waiters and staff . looking forward to going back ! 
i love this place , it ' s like having my ipod on while watching tv at home with some food i could never make that delicious . always fabulous . grits , sweet potato fries , what else is there to life ? 
the menu is great and the food is delicious , but the music is way too loud and not as cool as they think it is . the acoustics in this place suck and the din of the full room is bad enough without the blaring sound system . you actually have to yell to be heard across the table . after two requests N minutes apart they still hadn ' t lowered the volume . what ' s the point of that ? no one is there to listen to music . 
ode to pure thai shophouse having used yelp for several years , it is only fitting that my first review is for pure thai shophouse ( they had to change the name because of c d order from chipotle - long story ) . pure thai is a special place with incredible food . i ' ve travelled to thailand solely to eat street food , studied thai cuisine extensively ( thanks david thompson ) , and can make a handful of dishes rather well . that said , this place is legit ! they don ' t skimp on the heat to cater to the american palate , and the ingredients used are often different and of higher quality than other thai restaurants . it ' s a subtle difference , but those that pay attention can spot it . it is by far the best thai restaurant in manhattan hands down . outside of manhattan , i like ayada in queens and pok pok in brooklyn for its differentiated menu . the knocks yes , the prices are higher than other thai restaurants but the quality and range of cuisine is soooo much better . it simply is a cut above the rest . yes , it is a small place but this is manhattan , people . if you want a big restaurant , go to guy fieri ' s place in times square . yes , other thai restaurants may have larger menus . yes , for those who ' s experience w thai food is limited to pad thai , pad see ew , and green curry , you might not be able discern how unique pure thai really is . hype can ruin the experience for a lot of people , so please let ' s dispel with the hype and manage expectations . the layout walking into pure thai conjures a sense of place and brings back fond memories of eating street food in bangkok . it ' s a tight space w a soup station in the middle . it ' s designer decorator deserves high marks for all the attention to detail , from the corrugated ceiling , faux rundown wood paneling and fixtures , the accuracy of the chairs ( though a bit higher than those in thailand ) , tiling , quirky bathroom , etc . and the playful thai music that they play always puts a smile on my face ( too bad shazam doesnt recognize thai music - boo ) . the service the manager and wait staff are always very helpful , willing to explain the dishes , give recommendations , and answer all my random questions ( there are a lot ) . depending on the time you come , the tables can turn fast . the food like any restaurant , your experience is intimately tied to what you order . if you order the wrong things , it can ruin the experience . when i had access to free corporate dinners on seamless , i ' m pretty sure i ordered from here N nights a week for N years and i ' ve had everything on the menu , including a lot of the specials . because of this , i usually opt for the specials as they change daily and they are usually solid . everyday , there is a new special appetizer and main dish , as well as a desert , which changes frequently but not everyday . the specifics for appetizers , my favorites are the green papaya salad and vegetable dumplings . after that , the curry puffs and baby back ribs . watch the heat on the green papaya salad . the vegetable dumplings have peanut and corn inside and are a pleasant treat . the curry puffs have a different texture and a different taste profile , which is nice to switch things up . entrees in my mind , the execution of the wok dishes stands out , and i would recommend any of the wok dishes with heat but be mindful of the protein pairing . generally , i ' ll order the wok dishes with pork , shrimp , or calamari . the pad kee mao is good and a dependable standy . if you ask for it thai spicy , it will blow the barn doors off . note that there is a bit less differentiation with this dish because most thai places can make a decent pad kee mao and subtleties can get lost in the heat . the tom yum soup specials are amazing ! i just had a bowl with two shrimp the size of my fist . the sukhothai pork noodle soup is nice and simple when you are in the mood for a more basic soup . however , for soup , i might opt instead for ramen ( ippudo , totto ramen ) or pho . i digress . on the other hand , i don ' t really understand the hype around the ratchaburi crab noodles but i ate them cold after a couple hours so i should try them again . the specials in a soy garlic sauce gravy can be underwhelming if you ' re looking for something with a kick . i think the rice dishes are kind of boring but proper thai meals typically include a rice dish and it ' s more of a complement . desserts the desserts typically incorporate sticky rice with mango yam custard pumpkin custard warm coconut milk , chunks of coconut meat , and black beans etc . some come wrapped in a banana leaf . all very nice if you have room after the apps and entrees . usually , i ' m full and don ' t have room . thai iced coffee i like it ! very concentrated as it should be . they add cafe bustello , which has a special place in my heart . they used to serve the ice coffee in cool little pottery jars specially made in thailand , which have all but since broken . . . except for the two in my possession ! 
skip the tacos and burritos and go right for the entr es . simply excellent . chips and salsa , endless and fantastic . the desserts - second to none . if it wasn ' t for the snobby , hipster wait staff who treats you as if you were bothering them by being there , this would be a five-star place , no doubt . 
frankford hall is awesomeeeee ! first things first the sausages ! ! ! we got weisswurst and spicy bauernwurst , with sauerkraut and red cabbage , respectively . we also got fries with curry ketchup and sweet mustard . it was all so delicious ! one of us doesn ' t even like cabbage but the red cabbage was so good on the sausage ( and just in general ) he couldn ' t help but love it . it is also just so easy to walk right in , find a seat and get great food and beer . we got beers that were both good in different ways , so good that we might get each a tankard of beer next time ! 
great pizza , , , , , , , i love it . and great service . . . 
sit at the sushi bar and have your own private sushi chef ! we sat with chef yoshi and just let him decide what we got to eat , which is definitely the way to go . sushi at yasuda is very austere and simple . no fancy rolls , no creative uses of doritos chips . . . . just excellent fish and rice . come here if you like uni , because theirs is amazing . the toro will melt in your mouth . and the mochi ice cream at the end is perfection . i tend to prefer more imaginative sushi places but the quality here can not be denied . i ' m surprised it doesn ' t have a michelin star , since dollar for dollar the food quality is as good or better than jewel bako . 
i am particularly fond of the pasta dishes . the sauces are always scrumptuous . my husband really enjoys the variety of veal dishes offered . we were there last week for my birthday and to celebrate we indulged with a decadent caramel cake . . . yummy ! ! ! on the weekend , they have live piano music which is always a pleasure . the only negative to me are the wall decorations . . . they definitely are outdated . 
went tonight for a pre-show dinner . they seated us right way with no reservation , but the service was inattentive and the food was mediocre . we waited N minutes with no server , so i asked the busboy to send over the waitress and he offered to take our order . everything came out choppy from there . bread first - then oil N minutes later . each of our drink orders came out with a N minute lag between . first my wine - then N minutes later my husband ' s coke - then five minutes later my daughter ' s milk . appetizers were delivered about N minutes later and just as we were digging into those the entrees arrived . then finally our waitress showed up to check on us - the first time we saw her that night . the food was ok . i enjoyed the appetizers . we ordered the cheese plate , olives , and prosciutto . nice presentation and tasty . the entrees were not anything special . i ordered the rigatoni pizzaioli - the sausage was good , but the pasta was overcooked and bland . my husband ' s sausage and peppers was barely ok - needed more sausage and peppers and less pasta . my daughter ate one slice of her cheese pizza . the decent apps can ' t make up for the entree and the shameful lack of service , so i will stick to a N star rating and have no intention of returning . 
a great place for a snack when you are on the go . i ' ve been here a few times now and i think their falafal is really great ! for N it comes in a huge pita that is probably N regular orders at another place . service is really fast and the guys behind the counter are really friendly . i noticed that they have flat pitas that are sorta like mini pizzas . you can order them with zaatar , which is am amazing middle eastern herb mixture than i fell in love with when i was in jordan . so excited that i found a place that has this ! you can also get them with lamb and spinach and a few other options . they are cheaper than the falafel ! can ' t wait to try them out ! 
very good food . excellent value for the money . this byob is a great place to bring friends . the atmosphere was nice and clean . waiter was knowledgable and friendly . i had the veal sorrentino which was well prepared and very filling . definitely a good value for the money . 
it ' s like N flags for brunch got seated an hour after our reservation . was served a bloody mary in a diva-sized glass . food was really good - but come on , people - this fiasco is totally unnecessary . unless you like listening to whiney groups of girls talk about how their gucci bags and sundresses as an appetizer . 
food is great ! great service ! nice atmosphere ! chicken kabob sandwich was yummy . excellent ! highly recommend it ! 
it ' s traditional . if you ' ve never been , you have to go . the ingredients are fresh and you won ' t feel gross when you ' re done . it ' s a little bit of a tourist trap and it may take some time to be seated , but it ' s a pretty good pizza . not my favorite , but it ' s got some history and a great space . i take my family here after some shopping in chinatown whenever we go . don ' t go crazy with your toppings , do something classic like pizza margherita . 
jenga ! ! and about a million beers on tap bottles . in the summer they open up all the doors and it has an amazing indoor outdoor charm . on those cold brooklyn nights the fire place adds serious class . 
lovely atmosphere and relatively roomy for a philly byo - - but very loud , making conversation difficult . the hostess is abrupt and unfriendly and uninviting certainly she should not be standing at the door . our waiter was inattentive and rushed , and we , too , were left sitting at an empty table without water for several minutes . i likely had the same waiter as the previous poster , who impudently retorted when probed about menu selections . food was mediocre , the artichokes in the salad were tough and virtually inedible . the pappardelle mushroom and walnut sauce was wonderful , but the pasta itself was not outstanding . the short rib , however , was great . though the food was equivocal , this restaurant needs to work on service . melograno is anything but a warm and cozy byo and i wouldn ' t return . i would recommend la viola , branzino , and mercato hands-down over melograno . 
ordered online from grubhub . com and after waiting over an hour i got soggy stale french fries , tasteless rice and the smallest portion of beef ribs i have ever seen in my life . for the amount i had to pay it was the most disappointing meal i have ever had . i would not suggest this restaurant to anyone . 
outstanding home cooked , authentic cuban food ! the vaca frita , moros , ropa vieja , picadillo and tostones were amazing ! service was awesome too ! a must return visit in the near future . 
i have been to this restaurant at least N times and really enjoy each time . food and atmosphere are great and it is a great place for locals as well as those who come from out of town . however i was extremely disappointed at bar today . when i ordered a glass of champagne , a bartender gave me a glass of prosecco instead . it was not even a mistake ( i wish it was ) . i believed he assumed i would not know the difference . for the restaurant with that level , i do not think it is acceptable . it is pretty unfortunate and i don ' t ' think i can ' t take my people anymore as i do not want to be embarrassed . again it ' s enjoyable but please be careful and make sure that you get what you order . 
i went there ( by chance ) at the opening party . it ' s hard to judge a restaurant that just opened , but . . if they keep up the solid work and attention to detail this is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood . sure , there are already a few southern cuisine places in the area , and this doesn ' t feel exactly brooklyn-ish . but this is the one you go for a change , a nicer dinner , more lively dinner . it ' s slightly more expensive than the local average , but worth it . they call themselves fusion southern cuisine . i ' m happy for the southern part . i didn ' t really get the fusion part , but i ' m glad about that , because i really haven ' t had any good fusion food either at home or abroad . the food is really tasty . i had the skirt steak , which had a delicious sauce . my wife had the salmon with was very good too . and for dessert we had the creme brul e , which despite being too soft , tasted amazing . the vibe was a little loud , perhaps because it was the opening night , or because half the place is a bar with dj , but nevertheless i will definitely go back . the decor is nice . like a said doesn ' t feel very brooklyn , and it ' s supposed to be inspired by the brooklyn bridge , which you don ' t get at all - which is probably for the best . all in all this feels a bit like brooklyn ' s answer to cafeteria in chelsea . note . like luz , they should add an awesome N-N whole roast chicken to democratize the menu . it ' s a very sexy dish and it ' s alleviated me during hard times , for which luz won my undisputed loyalty . 
this is probably the closest to authentic mexican you ' re going to get in new haven , though with a disclaimer that i wouldn ' t know what truly authentic mexican food tastes like other than the few times i ' ve been to mexico . i ' ve been to cosinita many times and it has never disappointed . i usually get the chicken burrito which is just as big as a chipotle burrito but with what freshly grilled chicken that is still juicy , and the burrito itself has more sauce ( from the delicious beans that are not chunky ) and cheese . the tacos are fresh and more in the mexican style with onions , tomatoes , cilantro and guac ( no cheese unless you ask for it ) unlike all the chain taco places where you pay for every extra condiment other than lettuce , tomato and cheese . my favorite though is the chicken mole enchiladas . i have not had mole too many times before , but i certainly will be more open to trying it because of cosinita . the sauce is sweet and spicy , and has the slightly grainy texture of cocoa . the enchiladas are filled with tender chicken and lots of queso blanco ( some of the best cheese i ' ve had ! ! ! ) , and the mole also has lots of fresh chopped radishes which add to the heat and balance out the heavy enchilada with some fresh zest . the people are also really friendly , especially the waitress cashier who always suffers through my broken spanish and still says i ' m really good at it . the place is small so not great for huge groups but takeout is easy and they do a really good job of packing everything up , and it will still be warm when you get home . delicious , friendly , and priced similarly to chipotle , so why would i bother with the latter . 
love the vibe in this place . there plant based concept is great . you get real , whole , fresh ingredients . get the sweet potato fries and the whipped bananas for dessert , it ' s like ice cream you don ' t have to feel guilty about ! 
i ' ve been to this location a few times and absolutely love this place . i have severe dairy allergies and han ' s does not use dairy in their food . it feels great knowing i can order anything from the menu without having to stop by he emergency room . everything i ' ve tasted so far has been great , my favorite dishes are the green beans , the spicy cucumbers , and the seared lamb . the food is delicious , the service is great , and it has a great ambiance . 
every star fades eventually . joe allen ' s has enjoyed a far longer run than the kitchy broadway " flops " they proudly display on their wall , but has ended up a has-been just the same . even after its prime , there was a cool old-school vibe about the place . . . a new york theatre disrtict version of l . a . ' s brown derby . sadly , they have ended up just another tourist trap along restaurant row with uninspired food and shabby service . there are far better places to dine in the neighborhood . 
comfortable . relaxed setting . excellent food and drink . i had wine and filet of sole , my partner had a gin and tonic and spaghetti carbonara , and they were wonderful , including the presentation . the vegetables were perfectly al dente . the owner was friendly , and i overheard her telling a walk-in how he could find a bar showing the football game he wanted . we will definitely return when we ' re back in from kentucky ! 
i love john ' s . they have the best sandwiches ever ! ! ! ! plus not to mention , i know everyone that works there , they are very close friends of the family and my aunt works there . everyone is so nice ! ! ! there is no better place to get a sandwich ( hoagie , chicken cutlet , pork or steak ) when you are in philly ! ! ! ! ! ! 
N star review instead of N because i ' m not sure how fast i would rush back to rubirosa with all the other pizza places to try in the city , especially with the long wait times . with a party of N on a thursday evening , we waited an hour for a table . i ' m glad i was finally able to try this place though - the service and food were both really good . maybe worth the wait . they start you off with some bread and good extra virgin olive oil . we ordered the mini rice balls as an appetizer and a large mushroom pizza to share . if you have never had arancini ( they call them mini rice balls here ) , you must ! they are fried risotto balls with meat cheese -- here they serve them with prosciutto and mascarpone fontina cheese . how could that not be good ? the mushroom pizza has a combination of mushrooms ( i think porcini was in there . . always bonus points when that happens ) , snap peas , prosciutto and pecorino cheese . this combination of ingredients was one of the more unique combos i ' ve had on pizza . the mushrooms were melt-in-your-mouth earthy and went perfectly with the salty prosciutto , and the snap peas added a sweet crunch to every bite . really good flavor on a crunchy , thin crust . nice ambiance , good service , good pizza . 
top notch food ! top notch service ! top notch drinks ! ben and i were ravenously hungry after running errands all afternoon so we decided to go to the new and improved oyster house mostly because it was close . i expected to enjoy myself--i don ' t think i ' ve ever not enjoyed raw oysters and three old fashioneds-- but i was blown away . our lovely waitress made a really good recommendation for our second oyster selection . she suggested getting some from the west coast saying that they ' re not briny like the east coast ones we ' d already ordered and would be a nice sweet contrast . spot on . they were delicious . she came around just enough to make sure we got as many drinks as we wanted and was able to answer all of our menu questions confidently . what i liked best about the food was the variety . so many seafood establishments lack the impressive range of flavors found on the oyster house ' s menu . i ordered two small plates-- fried crab stuffed squash blossoms and the smoked trout salad . ben ordered the grilled bass over vegetable ragout . on one table we had cured smokey fish , amazingly fresh basil infused fish and tempura battered succulent crab with spicy tomato jam . ben ' s grilled bass was the best order . it was beautifully presented with the simply prepared piece of fish resting on a vibrant green broth dotted with red cherry tomatoes . i agree with his comment that it is a little misleading to call it a ragout , but it was a wonderful surprise-- so much better than a typical ragout . i will have to restrain myself from not ordering the bass next time we go . i had been to the oyster house before but ten years ago when it was a stodgy seafood establishment with a largely cream based menu . not only is the menu completely reinvigorated , but the decor is fresh while still retaining its sea-side feel . i ' m so glad they still have the collection of oyster plates displayed prominently-- they add a nice level of intrigue to the otherwise sparse contemporary atmostphere . we ' ll be back more than our wallets would recommend ! ( it ' s pricey , but well worth it . ) 
great food , horrible service
came here for dinner armed with a N off deal from bbe . between N , we had the following quick saute of zucchini ( w almonds and pecorino ) shrimp corn cakes grilled buttermilk pork chop crispy sauteed skate wing side of tempura green beans everything was good , but i wouldn ' t say one-of-a-kind . except maybe the pork chop . my bf loved it and was savoring every bite . it had a different flavor to it , almost southwestern , that was indeed , very good . with two glasses of wine , plus the N off deal , our total came to be about N ( so i guess around N w o the deal ) . not too bad , and we left feeling satisfied and happy . 
very good pizza . courteous and considerate staff . 
the pizza didn ' t really compare to what you can get at places like john ' s or arturo ' s . but then again , the financial district isn ' t exactly a food mecca , so you have to take that into account . i wouldn ' t mind coming back , but , i wouldn ' t make it a point to do so . 
i really like this place , but a little pricey . 
delicious food , excellent service , interesting menu items , fantastic atmosphere . . . we will be back . 
great place ! probably one of the best pizza places i ' ve been to . great assortments if meats to top your pizza and a great selection of beer to compliment that tasty pizza . i ' ll be sure to go back soon . 
i love the place . to avoid the long wait , i usually come here for lunch . my favorite dish is the pork bun . i have tried various ramen dish here , all are excellent . the service is friendly , genuine and fast . the restaurant is always buzzing . a little on the loud side , but i don ' t mind . i will definitely continue to visit here , again and again . 
linley s . got really excited when we had some time to kill and i mentioned i was hungry . she knew just the place to take my gluten-free appetite ! cutest little house shop , super friendly staff , and a myriad of delicious looking treats ! we poked around for a minute , it ' s a small shop but well laid out so you don ' t feel cramped . they had cupcakes , brownies , blondies , cookies , crumb bars , and muffins . plus a cold case of frozen gf goods . i heard they do a gluten free pizza as well ! i stocked up on a huge blondie , a small bag of chocolate chip cookies , and a coconut magic bar , plus a vegan cookie for my mother , and my sister got an apple crumb bar . prices are steep , but you are paying for non-gmo , soy free , gluten free baked goods that are made with care and taste amazing . it took me all day to get through the huge blondie , and i had half of the magic bar last night which is also huge . my mom enjoyed her cookie and sister enjoyed her apple crumb bar . so lucky for them to be so close to such a cool little shop that cares about what they ' re serving their customers . 
great portuguese restaurant . the portions are extremely large and the meats are fantastic . very helpful and friendly staff , and the valet is efficient . place is always jamming , but i ' ve always been seated quickly . you won ' t leave hungry . 
this place was amazing ! they had sooo much good food . the price is equally amazing for the options they had . i must have tried a little bit of everything ( hello buffet . ) the sushi was good except the soft shell crab pieces were dry . all the raw bar and huge crab legs were delicious . for dessert green tea ice cream and daifuku were yummy . they also have a fresh cooked area , the steak was amazing from here . cooked perfectly medium rare for my taste and tender . the only thing that is confusing is this place is called " sake bomb . " yet they have no alcohol ! ! ! lol go figure . however they do allow byob . notes - kimchi was bland soft shell crab was dry
we went to gatsby ' s on the bay for a special evening . we were greeted warmly by the owner . overall , the staff was attentive and engaging . the food was delicious for the most part . we ordered two of the steak selections the ribeye and the skirt steak . while the meat was done beautifully , certain items were oversalted . as there was a large party , we were seated close to the jazz trio that was performing . the combination of the two ( the party and the music ) however pleasant , was a bit loud . we chose to have our coffee and after-dinner drinks at the bar and it was a great decision . tara , the bartender , was attentive as was the owner who spoke with us for a bit . we had a great evening and we are looking forward to returning soon . 
the nicest pio pio in the city . . . extensive ceviche selection and it ' s amazingly good . i always get a pitcher of sangria a couple of ceviche dishes . . . that itself is a complete meal . booked a reservation N minutes before i arrived and instantly got a seat . . . while others who walked in and asked for a table had to wait N-N minutes . . . a big in yo face . service is a bit slower compared to the pio pio in queens so you lose an extra star . 
i ate at the greek lady twice before and had an ok experience . today i decided to order take out breakfast , N omelettes N coffees . the breakfast was ready when i got there they gave me a large paper shopping bag w take out containers ( even though it was pouring down rain ) . i started walking the N blocks back to my apartment when the paper bag burst open . the only thing salvageable was the N coffees . so i kept the bag receipt and called the restaurant when i got home . i told them what happened and asked if they could deliver the N omelettes to replace the ones laying all over the sidewalk . the girl taking the order asked how i was paying for the replacement omelettes . i told her she should cover the omelettes . she put me on the phone w the manager who insulted me and said it was my fault the containers fell out of the bag . i then asked to be refunded for the breakfast N . . . and he said i was crazy . so basically i ended up paying N for N coffees not getting the breakfast . i can say the greek lady has the worst customer service ever very ignorant when speaking with customers . maybe the greek lady should invest in plastic bags . never going back here . i would give this place negative stars if i could . 
i always enjoy myself when i go to the venture . great staff and food . 
i am a regular at this unassuming homely little establishment . juniper offers a refreshing break from the pomp of much of williamsburg , paring down stuffy atmospherics to focus on making great food at a decent price . staff are always super friendly and accommodating ( last time i was there they were more than happy to move around half the restaurant to accommodate a group of N of us ) and the owner himself will always take the time to have a chat . the burgers are phenomenal very simple , really high quality meat and a great selection of cheeses , as are the spicy fries ! byob is a great money saver . quaint little courtyard out the back where you can while away a balmy afternoon . i cannot speak highly enough of juniper ! if you haven ' t yet given it a go , it ' s about time you did . 
we were really looking forward to coming here . the reviews have been amazing . unfortunately our experience was not very good . despite the very cozy atmosphere , and great servers , the food was less than good . while the sauces were rich and flavorfull , the lamb in our dishes seemed to have been prior cooked and dumped in the curry . the lamb was obviously not cooked in the curry , because it had no flavor . the goat was chewy , and clearly not cooked enough to seperate from the bone , also not flavored . if you dont mind pretty chewy , unflavored meat floating in admitedly delicious curry sauces , you could enjoy the food here . 
i ' ve lived in firenze for a year and i can tell you that their panini is the real deal . get the parma for god ' s sake , it ' s magic . 
just perfect . service flawless at every stage . i entered with luggage , a briefcase , and a blazer and they graciously checked all three immediately . as i waited for my date , they offered me a drink at their slick bar . when i raced out of the restaurant to go find my date ( who was lost ) , they didn ' t bat an eye . when they noticed we were on a date , they seated us at an intimate corner table . the staff were consistently friendly , professional , and informative , without being too chatty or intrusive . the pace of the meal was perfect we never felt like we were waiting for anything , yet also never felt rushed . food while i adore korean food , i don ' t normally associate it with fine dining , and was admittedly skeptical . unnecessarily . jungsik ( pronounced " chongshik " ) does an excellent job at toeing the line between traditional korean and modern culinary trends . we opted for the tasting menu and were not disappointed each dish was beautifully presented and prepared to perfection . the only items that fell below " excellent " were the petit fours served at the end . our green tea confection was too bitter , and the others were underwhelming . but at that point we were so full , i ' m not sure it would have been possible to satisfy us . in addition to our food , we also ordered two cocktails each , and were again very impressed . their house martini ( a korean take on a dirty martini ) was the standout for me . all said and done , the damage was a bit over N , and it was worth every penny . 
my favorite is always something with bacon d
that ' s a great bang-for-your-buck as it gets ! delicious fresh food , generous portions for an almost ridiculous prices . you can have such a tasty dinner for just few dollars . was never huge on tacos before but here they are seriously fantastic , this is not your run-of-the-mill mexican junk food . i ' m as a carnivore as it gets but even the vegetarian taco was special , filled with surprising goodies in it . and the chorizo one , yummmmm . . . . such a great addition to the food options on this block . great location , in between some of the most popular bars in the east village . no need for that digusting pizzas at the end of a drinking night . a healthy post booze munchie , who could ve imagined that ? kudos to the friendly chef and staff , welcome to the neighborhood ! ! 
mmmmmmmmmm . . . . dumplings . . . . . . . . not sure what to say about this place but the dumplings were amazing . we had the crab and pork dumplings and i could have stopped there and been truly happy . we also ordered the scallion pancakes which were not as dense and heavy as other scallion pancakes i have had - i liked joe ' s much better . the crispy sesame beef was sweet and tangy and was especially good if you took it with a bite of jalapeno which we got from the order of pork , squid and tofu jalapeno dish . everything was really really good . i come to nyc every other week for work and this restaurant will definitely make the eating circuit . side note - they only take cash . 
this restaurant is really expensive for what you get . tiny portions and simple sides are not included and expensive if added . the food was about average at best . in an area where you can get amazing food easily , it was disappointing . my husband had the steak frites , the portion was small ( maybe a Noz steak and a tiny portion of fries ) and though they boast about their special local meat it was average , it was also over N . he never eats all his dinner but it was such a tiny portion that his plate was bare when he finished . i had mussels , they came with some very stale toasted bread and nothing else , i ordered a side of fries for N ( it was about a half handful of fries ) they were okay . i have had better mussels and fries many , many times ( bluebird does them fantastically ) . we also each had a drink , and he had an appetizer of shrimp fritters ( three ping pong ball sized fritters on a giant plate with a scatter of wilted arugula ) which he said were good but i thought were gross , squishy and bland . the best thing we had was the free chef ' s taste of braised carrots , which was a tiny carved ball of carrot braised in cider and served with a dot of marscapone , it was excellent but not actually on the menu . the atmosphere was okay , comfortable and clean but really loud . the dining room is one large open room and is also open to the kitchen , it has leather benches , maple tables , rustic lighting and decorations and then elaborate framed mirrors and art work . the service was good and i appreciated that they had a coat check . our bill came to N and we came home not feeling full or fulfilled . i don ' t mind an expensive dinner ( we knew it was going to be when we went there ) if we are getting some value for our money , an excellent meal , real portions and not being nickled and dimed . i wouldn ' t go back . 
huge rip off and a tourist trap . see below for just the facts . - the place is dirty . the tables , menus , and floors are covered in grime . the menus feel sticky . - prices are higher than your average chinese restaurant . - poor quality food . they chopped the fattiest part of the duck for my bf . two-thirds of it was inedible . . . unless globs of oily skin and fat are your ideal . - waiters are inattentive to their customers . i asked for a bowl of rice but had to remind the waiter twice to bring it . 
i just tried their wv location . the outside area was just set up that night so the service was somewhat disorganized but our waitress was very sweet and helpful . we had the butternut squash soup , brocolli rabe , the fennel salad , and the polenta . it was very fresh and the really good . i would definitely go back . note--we waited for N minutes and we got there at Npm . it ' s a busy spot ! 
nice atmosphere and good service . they have a great menu for everyone . crispy pizza and good taste . 
ferrulli ' s pizza is the best in town . plus their italian entree dinners are also great . chicken parm , sausage and peppers and many others are all great . nutley is a very italian town , and ferrulli ' s is best-in-breed . 
last night we went to this restaurant for my co-worker celebration dinner the owner was very disrespectful to my staff . he kept skipping our party of N . when we brought it to his attention he was rude . he began to say he did not give a f k we can go . why would we give our to a business that treats his customers like that . i will never go back do not recommend this place at all . food is not authentic cuban food . mambo tea is way better
michael white does not disappoint with this upscale joint . the bone marrow risotto with lobster is the best thing i have ever eaten . period . the veal chop for the main was the best piece of veal i have ever had . great service , and an amazing bar tender . 
the most confounding , irritating waitlist system where we were originally told N-N minutes , only to be told at the one hour mark that people who called ahead go to the front of the line . as to why we weren ' t told up front it could be N mins or an hour and a half ( at one hour four tables of two still ahead of us ) , " i ' m sorry . " so sabrina , that sucks
i have to say that besides the bartender the service is bad ! ! . . . . . . . the food is good . 
aside from our friendly waiter and decent corn bread , my gf and i were very unimpressed with our dinner at cast iron soul . we ordered a N-entree , N-side platter , consisting of ribs and chicken , candied yams , mac and cheese , potato salad , and dirty rice . the platter only contained N ribs , and a single chicken thigh , even though it was supposed to be two entrees worth . the ribs were decent , but nothing special , and the chicken was bland . also , the yams were only slightly warmer than room temperature . in addition , the sweet tea was so sweet it was undrinkable . very underwhelming , despite the friendly staff . 
i had an amazing dinner here on saturday evening . i dined with my husband to celebrate my birthday . we were sat immediately by the manager , who was very nice and welcoming . i really liked that a waiter brought us water immediately , and our waitress followed up right after . there is nothing worse than having to wait a long time for service or something to drink . our server , maureen , was very kind and very familiar with the menu . she recommended the lobster carpaccio and a bacon and fig salad for appetizers , which were great . the lobster was incredibly fresh and the peas with it really worked . i had the salad and it was the best one i ' ve ever had . the figs , gorgonzola and bacon were the perfect pair , especially withy the chianti our server suggested . since she did such a nice job suggesting appetizers , we asked her input for entrees . i was very happy with the lobster ravioli the sauce was incredible and my husband said his filet was cooked perfectly . the chocolate bread pudding for dessert was a slice of heaven . overall , peppercorns did a great job making my birthday dinner a great one . 
i really enjoy the atmosphere at this restaurant . some of the workers just sit around , but i ' m not here to complain about that . the tables are clean and everyone is friendly . very expensive , but refills for fries and soda make up for it ! the meat , mozzarella sticks , are very good . the burger rolls are decent . i love franks hot sauce . overall a good place . 
my husband and i ate here after a phillies game . the watress was very helpful and pleasant . the atmosphere , and the food was perfect . we look forward to heading to august again ! 
i have a new favorite bar in the financial district ! ! cozy feel . sawdust on the floor . how cool is that ? ! ? gorgeous bartender brooke , makes a mean black and tan . i highly reccomend . 
this place is every bit as good as grimaldi ' s . pizza is better , there ' s no wait , and it ' s cleaner . we had the scarmoza and it was amazing ! ! one of the best pizzas i have ever had . note crust is thicker than patsy ' s or certe . 
this is our new favorite restaurant ! my boyfriend and i and his family were already there twice in one month ! all the pastas are fantastic but i must recommend the homemade pasta in a leek sauce i truly wanted to do a happy dance after eating it . i ' ve been day dreaming about it all week ! the service here is impeccable . the chef came over to our table to tell us about a wine we never had before and were interested in . he was so sweet and proud of his food and we all just felt so happy to be there . his daughter maria , the hostess was so friendly . they reminded us of our own family and that is what you want when you go to a restaurant . wonderful experience . can ' t wait to go back ! by the way , they have a gluten free menu ! 
don ' t believe the hype . extremely underwhelming , especially considering the many great reviews on yelp . this place does not seem french but an american attempt at french that was more of a miss than a hit . service disorganized , uncomfortable we were made to wait N minutes for our N N reservation . had to wait on the sidewalk . my friend was freezing . not a pleasant way to start a meal . the hostess came outside and said that a table of four just paid their check , but was dragging their heels and the chef was going to make his way over to encourage them to wrap things up . yes , i wanted my table , but that is just wrong and rude to rush another party out the door . a good french meal should be one where you can linger for a while before getting the boot . i feel badly that the table before us was shooed away , and of course , when the chef came to our table at the end of the meal i wondered if this too was our signal to scram because we were one of the last tables in the restaurant . our waiter had already left without saying goodbye . did they want us to leave so they could clean and close ? we had been in the restaurant just an hour and a half , which is not very long for three courses of french food . this restaurant is small . i feel they probably try to turn over too many tables in one night to maximize profit , but it really sacrifices the ability to enjoy the meal . they use their size as an excuse for the tight timing , but really it is their fault if they cannot figure out how to best run their reservations without making people wait in the cold for a table or hurrying you through your dining experience . atmosphere lacking i like that the decor is simple and unpretentious . but they could use some bit of atmosphere . from the lighting to the icky green walls , nothing about this place was inviting nor relaxing . i certainly would not come here for a romantic date . dietary accommodations excellent my husband is seriously allergic to dairy . the staff and chef bent over backwards to make many adjustments to his food , bringing sauces on the side , altering the preparation of dishes . they never made us feel like it was a drag to have to accommodate his allergy . it was very much appreciated and noticed by all at the table . food meh . nothing was memorable , except the butter that came with the bread . the gravlax tasted like something i could have whipped up easily in my own kitchen . the seared foie gras was good , but the custard was so heavy and unbalanced in flavor i found it inedible . and how can a french inspired restaurant not offer a salad anywhere on their menu ? my friend enjoyed her scallops . my husband like his fish . two of us didn ' t finish our entrees . ( both lamb loin . ) the flavors were average , nothing married together , the veggies were all kinds of wrong - some very tough and woody , and they seemed thrown together because they might sound interesting on a menu along with caper berries but were not actually great to eat . dessert what the hell ? perhaps it was the preface of the chef coming to our table and telling us he is not very good at making desserts . what a downer . he said his skills have vastly improved in N years . i ' d hate to taste those desserts a few years ago because we found ours inedible . this happens to have been the third time in a month and a half that i have been at a restaurant serving floating islands - ouefs ala niege . so i thought why not go for three . this tasted like a disneyland version of french dessert . the egg whites were heavy and sticky instead of light and fluffy , as they should be . it was so overly sweetened , so sickeningly sugary , that the creme anglaise seemed like a bottled nesquick drink . between the four of us , we could not finish half the dessert . if your pastry skills are that lacking , wouldn ' t you hire a pastry chef or have your desserts brought in ? i am confused about all the glowing reviews of this place . i wonder if they are from people who have never eaten french food before . i would not avoid eating here if i had friends who invited us to dine with them , but i would not go back to this place on my own volition . certainly there must be better french inspired restaurants on philly , and if not , i ' d rather hop the train to ny . i was disappointed that our friends who came with us were from chicago , considering moving to philly , and had such a negative impression of the food scene here . 
c ' est un bon caf ! j ' ai eu le petit dejeuner complet avec the , orange presse et un croissant du beurre et confiture . the swanky little cafe in soho would be perfect if the staff wasn ' t so bummed to be serving people . i wouldn ' t expect it to be any better . . . it is , after all , in soho . there are just a few outdoor tables . . . i wasn ' t lucky enough to grab one . the indoor seating is a little cramped but not unpleasant . the prices are not horrible . . . about what you would expect and no more than if you were in a cafe in paris . i ' d go back in a heartbeat . bring cash . . . no credit cards . they are taking their theme of hipsters-meets-Ns and running with it . why every establishment can ' t use credit cards is beyond me . . . 
saturday mornings is a big day for buying breakfast for us . also when there ' s a pto meeting where i need to get a dozen bagel on a platter served with cream cheese . my husband got me into eating blue berry bagel and the one that they have here is ok . the bagel street in montgomery and the bagel shop in pennington tastes much better . over-all i think this place is good . they have a wide selection of sandwiches . people are very accomodating . 
i was really surprised to see anything less than N stars for this place . this is a great , fast breakfast spot . when you are late , in a hurry and want eggs or pancakes this place is awesome . i come here a lot on my way into work in the morning . i recommend this place all the way . 
a fun time at this place , especially if you get a table to eat their great food . 
we have been going to libretti , s for many years and the quality and value is as good today as in the past . the chicken arrabiatta is superb . service with a smile . try it on a saturday night when you walk through the bar to your table you will swear your on set for the sopranos . . . 
just wow . so many games i felt like a kid again ! we had no idea there was an ugly sweater partty going on but it was really cool and helped get us in the holiday spirit . the bartender helped us navigate the food menu , which looks pricey at first , but it was explained its all farm to table and local so we went for it . thought it would be just pub food but nope , it was farmhouse level grub and we go there quite a bit . now we can eat , have a perfect beer pairing , and play pinball . so glad this place opened up . the staff seemed really busy but got to us quickly anyway . one employee , with an very ugly sweater and snowflake tatoo on his forehead ( nametag said blender ? ) gave us his gifts from the event , and we tried to buy him a drink but he turned it down like a pro . can ' t wait to come back when it isnt so busy , did not know it was kid friendly so we hope to book a mellow birthday party . thanks tilt for the awesome night ! 
great place for vegan food and breakfast especially . the service is good most of the time . but the food is a bit of a one trick pony . think junk food for vegans . the wait is sometimes long for breakfast . 
the only reason i ' m giving this two stars is because i really enjoyed the dumplings . ok i got the peashoot and garlic dumplings . they were boiled to perfection . the outsides weren ' t gross and hard or too gooey . the flavor was pretty fantastic . honestly , i wish they would have filled them up a bit more and they should offer another veg flavor to keep things fresh and interesting . the sauce was great as well . there are six per order served on a leafy bed . then i ordered the " key lime pie " . umm . . . . key lime pie is not supposed to be a frozen white unflavored lump . it was disgusting . it tasted like it had been in the freezer for months and was one of those crappy store-bought ones . bad idea . the service here is terrible . i came in on a friday at about N in the afternoon . it was dead . there were N servers and N tables ( mine included ) that were occupied . the server i had was completely rude and too busy talking to her co-workers to actually do her job . one of the other servers actually had to give me my check . i looked at it and couldn ' t really read the writing but it turns out they tried to overcharge me almost N ! i found this out after waiting for the server to come get the check for N minutes . what the heck ? i ' m clearly sitting here waiting for you and you just ignore me and chat with your friends . they expected me to just leave a N bill for a check that should have only been N at most . sorry , your service definitely didn ' t warrant an eight dollar tip . i wouldn ' t come back here again after the poor treatment and subpar food i got . i can find amazing dumplings elsewhere . 
went there for a friends Nth b-day on her choosing and really enjoyed it . she had ordered the whole suckling pig for her party . it comes with N side dishes . we ordered about N other tapas while we waited for the pig . one was better than the last . each friend had a different fav . i really loved the short rib flat bread , and the peppers stuffed with crab . the highlight of the meal was the pig skin that was amazingly perfect ! the service was great too ! 
they are still around at the prudential arena , bbq kiosk they currently smoke there meats at the wood pit bbq in montclair , nj . check out the wood pit if your a bbq fan . not sure if jt ' s bbq will re-open . 
my favorite place to chill and hang out with friends . awesome made to order salads ! rest of the menu is stellar as well . cool interior , relax in cozy sofa or chairs . free wireless . vegetarian vegan menu items , including cupcakes ! did i mention that i love their salads ? ! ? 
dough is simplyawesome ! ! ! i have eaten at dough three times for lunch and once for dinner and i can ' t stop raving about this place . the service is great ! the waitstaff are pleasant , helpful and enthusiastic about the restaurant and the food . i consider myself a pizza connoisseur and this pizza is awesome ! most certainly a top N in my opinion . the ingredients are high quality and fresh . i also place great value on the farm to table approach . but what is most notable about the pizza ( my favorite is the margharita ) , is that it is really light , the crust is " airy " and after eating it i don ' t feel full , heavy or like a glutton . imagine eating an individual pizza pie but feeling like you had a small piece of salmon and steamed vegetables . that has been my experience each time . dough has a large table up front that is somewhat separate , which accomodates a large party and gives a bit of privacy . they also have a separate room that could be used for a private event and a cozy outdoor patio . i highly recommend this restaurant ! ! check it out ! ! 
yea , this is some dank ass grilled cheese . i got the special because i was craving buffalo chicken at the time . . . and oh man . . you bit into this thing and the wonderful grease and buffalo flavor come bubbling through the crispy sour dough crust and into your mouth . . . it is most wonderful . the chicken is juicy and not over cooked . and the tots . . oh man these are the best tots ever . i highly recommend this place . its located N feet from the subway station in a nice little court yard where you are away from all the street hustle and bustle . you can watch all the business men walk to and from buildings down the concrete steps . and the cashier is hot and bubbly . i also had the roast beef with aged cheddar onions and horse radish . which was phenomenal . better then he buffalo chicken . the roast beef was hot and juicy and it was still pink in the middle . i was very surprised that at N N on a sunny N degree friday afternoon there was no wait or crowds at this place . but yay for me ! way to go melt shop ! 
this place is actually nice . it has free filtered water too . the food here is good . and it is also affordable , which means eat you can eat under N . i need to come here again . i have not gone during lunch so i don ' t know how busy it can get . the staff is really friendly . especially the two pretty girls that i saw when i went in . the only complain i would have about this place is the portions served . i eat a lot so portions always get my attention . they do have competition with a seafood spot right next door . but who doesn ' t love mexican food . 
last week was my first trip to hip city veg and it was amazing ! i ' ve been wanting to try it for quite some time but never ventured over and now i can say this might become a regular stop for me . i had a cheesesteak , sweet potato fries with sriracha aioli and carrot ginger lemonade . my husband had the crispy hipcity ranch . both were equally as delicious . i must say the cheesesteak was one of the best i ' ve had . the portion of sweet potato fries was large enough to share but we each got our own ( i devoured every single one with no regret ) . my husband really enjoyed his sandwich , it reminded me of the buffalo chik ' n sandwich from veggie grill on the west coast - and that ' s a good thing . i really wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time . 
really good chicken and waffles . i ' d come back for the waffle alone . . . i can ' t quite put my finger on what ' s in the waffle that makes it so , so good , but it was just amazing . looking forward to trying some of the other dishes , especially the mac and cheese ! 
what a great place ! great food , good service and awesome decor ! the only thing that was weird was in the middle of our meal N ladies walked in for lunch and were coldly turned away by the host who informed them that they would be switching the kitchen over from lunch to dinner soon and so they could not be served . the ladies informed the hostess that they had traveled very far to come to this specific restaurant but she still turned them away . considering my boyfriend and i along with one other couple were the only people in the restaurant , i didn ' t see why they wouldn ' t just let the women stay ? ! the women were so upset and we felt bad for them and even a little uncomfortable considering this happened right next to our table . . . . very awkward
been there N that ! ! ! ! 
perhaps i am a snob for deli ' s . . . but i just wasn ' t satisfied with the pastrami on rye at hershel ' s . i think that the philadelphia jewish deli experience is not fulfilled here and in fact , it is not fulfilled anywhere , not even at Nth street delicatessen . in all honesty , you have to go to new york or baltimore . these are the places with the good deli ' s and the old school panache that make them the world ' s greatest deli ' s . attman ' s , katz ' s , ben ' s best kosher , weiss ' . . . you can ' t deny these places . anyways , a solid effort hershel ' s on the hot dog . . . i love the sauerkraut on a hebrew national frank ! 
good food , price is good and like the sitting area . my favorite spot for lunch . 
i discovered el fuego while working downtown for a certain car sharing operation that shall go un-named . it ' s fast and like most mexican take out joints you get a boatload of food for under N bucks . i instantly fell for the pulled spicey beef quesadilla . there ' s no frills and there ' s no buffet style line like other places in the city but it hits the spot . plus i really don ' t mind supporting a small local restaurant as opposed to a corporate chain . one day i discovered the new location at Nst chestnut , which looked so welcoming with the tables outside and the huge indoor space . i got a frozen margarita which was basically a spiked slurpee with chips n salsa for N bucks during happy hour . it was airy and un-crowded , i sat up front by the open windows with a great view of the street . neither place will knock your socks off but for a simple cheap meal i don ' t see what ' s not to like . 
detroit native here - husband and i did the challenge between geno ' s and pats and , in my opinion , i liked the flavor better at geno ' s . i thought the cheese was tastier and the onions sweeter . overall it ' s a good sandwich . however - the " this is america , speak english " propaganda everywhere is a huge turn-off for me . i don ' t live in philly but i know it to be a melting pot , and it ' s pretty clear that with a name like geno , you ' re probably from an immigrant family . it ' s clear that there are plenty of other places i should ' ve tried instead . 
small place , ok ambience , really good food . 
calzone and pizzas were amazing ! being told we ' d have to wait N hours to be seated not ok . of the N times i ' ve attempted to eat here , i ' ve only waited it out and actually ate here once . the service left much to be desired , our waiter seemed annoyed with us and his job and his stalled acting career , but his clothing and hair were immaculate ! i get very annoyed when i read reviews where peoples ' main gripes are about the clientele of an establishment . it ' s kinda like someone going to a jerk chicken place in east new york and then writing on yelp they didn ' t enjoy their meal because they don ' t like black people . also amusing is how many people write " but i ' m no hipster " yet their photo says quite the contrary ! hahahahaha
great food , so delicious . great atmosphere . friendly service . price wasn ' t bad and most of all it ' s byob . definitely try the food out for yourself , you won ' t be disappointed . 
if you ' re in the mood for something different . . . interesting dishes for sure . the five course tasting menu is a great deal . the place is sophisticated and brightly light with the kitchen in the center which i like . staff was friendly . every taste was an adventure , but i ' d rather not go on the sea urchin adventure again . . . weeeiird . the lamb loin and the pork belly were delish . after eating i felt like a heavy oompa loompa though . . i ' m not sure what that ' s about . maybe don ' t eat all day and get the N course . . that sounds like a fun day for the tongue . you ' re going to need room to appreciate the goodness . 
well , we stop at this place with a party of N people and were a bit concerned with the previous reviews . we each were first shocked with decor and ambiance at first ( it is like you are in a different world ) . then , we were escorted to our table . we each order a different appetizer to try everything . waw the hummus is to die for and that med . platter what a great combination . then , we had the mediterranean salad very fresh and juicy . then we had dinner my talapia was special it was a great piece of fish and a lot of food . later , for desert we tried that middle eastern dessert kinnafa and baklava " homemade " ohh my god this is my best dessert ever . any way we all have agreed this place is not just good but great and authentic . i guess all these reviews are from kids about hookah well how can you taste food when you are puffing that dust and smoke . this is definitely my next stop for good food and great place nearby . 
had a truly wonderful meal with friends , however i must admit listening to hard rock during my meal was a little odd . i felt like i was in a bikers bar . besides the atmosphere that was different , the food was amazing . had the spinach salad and the special pasta of the day . it was truly delicious and loved the portions , not to big so was able to finished every little bite . satisfied . 
one of the very best , fancy , elegant restaurants in dc , appropriately located in georgetown to match its upper-class atmosphere . my wonderful girlfriend took me here for my birthday recently , and i loved every minute of the meal-- from the exemplary service , to the fabulous wine we enjoyed , and then there ' s the outstanding food-- i had a delicious scallops-lobster appetizer , a main course of duck breast , and topped it all off at the end with an incredibly rich , scrumptious hazelnut chocolate cake ! i would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or to impress out-of-town visitors . 
meatball shop is great . cool , casual , and good food . we sat at the bar and ate which was fine . i had one beef meatball slider and one spicy pork meatball slider both with regular sauce . the meatballs were good and so was the sauce . the spicy pork had a good kick of heat . i had the mushroom risotto for a side , it was good but very al dente . very cool and easy orgering system where u fill out your own menu sheet . i would like to go back and try some of there other options . reasonable pricing too
everyone has said it , i have nothing to add . it ' s too doughy , the toppings themselves are de f ' in licious . amazing . i wasn ' t hungry but i had to have some on my way home . if they reduce the dough , this place will be uber high end . as it stands , they ' ll cater to the Nam crowd , which i ' m sure they ' ll be fine with given how many people are here at this time . in any case - this place is rock ' n hardcore . not the best , but definitely worth a taste . mmmm . . . . love the classic artihoke and spinach . . . mmm . . . . 
i have been to this eccola a few times , each time was different . when dinning in ( as long as you are with the right people ) the experience can be very pleasant and enjoyable . when ordering takeout however , go somewhere else and do not expect anything close to what you get in the restaurant ! the food was bland , and of course they forgot to put part of a meal in the bag and when i called to ask about the missing item the woman who answered the phone was very rude . . . i have experienced this before when dinning here , and read in previous reviews that others have received the same rude treatment . this place is in a strip mall next to a cluck-u and indian grocery in parsippany . . i think it ' s time the staff got off their high horses and started appreciating customers . someone said it before me- if you don ' t mind rude staff , then give this place a try because the food is pretty decent . if you want to be treated like you are appreciated , then go somewhere else . 
i stopped in here for a bite and was able to take advantage of the outdoor patio on the warm brooklyn day . i asked the waiter to recommend his favorite thing , which was the lamb , so i got the lamb . the lamb plate came with totally undressed iceberg lettuce and the wateriest hummus i ' ve ever encountered in my life . thankfully the lamb and fresh pita and mint tea were tasty , becuase those were the redeeming qualities of the meal . also , cash only without a big sign in front saying so ? total boooooo . 
awesome pizza i ' m a fan
i ' ll preface by saying that the travel channel runs a nice racket of taking places that are alright and then turning them into tourist must-see spots . this is one of those spots . i had a pork sandwich with the broccoli rabe . it was a good sandwich . the pork was tender and juicy , but could have used some more spice or kick . the broccoli rabe didn ' t add a whole lot to the sandwich . it was just very bland . the bread was good and soaked up the juices nicely . it just didn ' t live up to the hype . i overheard the waitress recommending the brisket over the pork . the next time i ' m in philly , i ' ll have to try the brisket . sandwich with broccoli rabe and drink came out to N bucks . not that great a deal . also , i had just eaten another meal and i had no problems finishing this sandwich . lines are ridiculously long for to go orders . if you can , just stand by the counter until a seat opens up . if you ' re near the reading terminal market , give this place a try . i wouldn ' t go out of my way though . 
all i can say is omg ! first of all the food was fantastic and the service and ambiance was right on point . being from new york makes me somewhat of a food and service snob but salute lives up to the hype . not to mention how incredibly accommodating jimmy was by not only squeezing me in for a reservation but also going above and beyond to take care of my family . i just want to applaud their efforts and say thank you for a wonderful experience ! 
if you are looking for an amazing night out and great tasting food this is the place . i have been coming here for years and have tried almost everything ! the best part is the service is just as amazing as the food ! so next friday or saturday night bring a few bottles of wine and you will have a great experience ! i would definitely recommend luca ' s ! 
this place is pretty solid . all those people that gave it low ratings need to modify their expectations of having all their wishes and desires granted in one eating establishment . the atmosphere is a huge bonus , it ' s dark and pretty inside . the ingredients are all high quality . it makes for a nice night . maybe it ' s just the way i talk , but whenever i mention this place , people think i ' m saying " juicy penis " . so be aware . 
after a long kickboxing session during which my stomach was loudly growling because i woke up too late to eat breakfast before class , i came here super hungry . after a brief N minute wait ( which turned out to be exactly the amount of time my late friend needed to get there ) , we were seated and given menus , waters , and biscuits . before even looking at the menu , my friend and i dived for the biscuits . they were were delicious ! warm , soft , and so good with the butter and jam . we demolished them in about N minutes and then proceeded to look at the menu . we both decided to order the almond hash and also got a refill on the biscuits . the hash was pretty good . i had a bite of the toasted bread that came with it , but decided against eating it since i had so many biscuits . the poached eggs were perfectly poached and i loved the potatoes ! the duck also added a nice touch , though it could ' ve been a bit crispier and flavorful . the portion was huge ! about four bites in i already felt full ( okay , this is probably the fault of the biscuits ) , but both of us were struggling to get anywhere near finishing our food . service was quick and friendly . it seems like a great place to grab casual drinks with friends , i ' ll have to check it out ! 
ynez has a lot of my favorite things going for it mexican food , diner decor , and super-friendly waitstaff . this place has been on my list since it opened , so i was really happy to have brunch here yesterday . the bike parking is basically non-existent , so that was a bummer , but this is in a strange transitional area right on the border between south philly and graduate hospital . we were seated immediately in a comfy booth with retro tables and really interesting artwork . my only other complaint is a lack of simple syrup or liquid sweetener for the iced coffee , but i ' m just being picky . i split the breakfast burrito and the chilaquiles entrees . the burrito was definitely the better dish , although it was a bit dry . it had a lot of great ingredients , but could have used a little kick of something , or perhaps some smothering . the chilaquiles on the other hand were almost drowning in salsa verde . i know this is a traditional dish , but this one had borderline too much salsa and not much else going on . both of them were solid dishes with N-star potential , and the service here is fantastic . i like the size of the menu and the prices are really excellent compared to basically any other brunch in the city . i ' ll be back ! 
my wife and dined here with another couple saturday night . we made a reservation a few days ahead , when we arrived our outdoor table request was ready for us with out name on the table . nice touch . there was a live band that night so it was pretty busy , atmosphere was energetic and funny . ok now for the food . cheesy garlic bread is a must . all four of our meals came out on time and hot . food was incredible , i got the rigatoni carbonara and it was great . our waiter was also very good , great service and fun to talk to very personable . 
yes , nicks original roast beef will remain an original . simplicity perfected . i eat there several times a year , more so when the phillies are in town . . nothing better than a cold beer and a hot roast beef combo to start the game off . . keep up the good work . . . 
as close a cousins bbq and mexican are , there ' s an inexplicable dearth of restaurants that marry the two ( which in the states where these cuisines flourish is mostly legal to do ) . the folks of tres carnes aren ' t relying on your familiarity with the foods to win you over either- serious consideration went into both the smoked meats and the mexican inspired preparations and ingredients they ' re paired with . some lesser minds will immediately drop the " c " word to help you understand what ' s happening at the corner of Nth and Nnd ignore them and their opinions , they ' re not your friends but decepticons with poorly programmed reasoning skills . something much better has landed at this intersection , something more than the sum of its parts . . . something delicious and new . 
ordered online , over N hours later food still is not here . called mamagyro an hour after , they said food is on its way , called N minutes after still no food , finally N hours later , they say all deliveries went out , grill is closed , no food ! never order ! ! ! ridiculous ! ! ! ! ! 
my husband and i had a wonderful experience this past sunday for our Nst wedding anniversary ! we were originally drawn to this restaurant for the food items , i . e . sugar-free dessert options , wild-caught fish , and interesting food combinations . every time we have dined there , we have never been disappointed . the staff are so friendly and attentive . as a result , we chose to have our anniversary party in the private room . when we contacted the owners to make the arrangements , they were so easygoing and accommodating . it truly was an amazing experience . all our guests agreed that the food was so delicious . i read in someone else ' s review that the menu is " pricey " , but i disagree . the portions are very generous and i look forward to taking home the leftovers . when you consider how many meals you will get for the price not to mention the quality and how the food is responsibly prepared ( check out their website ) , it ' s well worth it to me . i ' ve paid equal or more for a meal at other places that was awful . i highly recommend this restaurant and am eagerly looking forward to our next visit . 
i . love . this . place . if you ' re anything like me , you ' re the type to appreciate the best of the best without that bougie-presumptuous feel . five stars are reserved for the best of the best of what they are- if that makes any sense . when it comes to impeccably seasoned , unbelievably fired food , understated by a relaxed atmosphere - this sets the bar . make it happen . this place makes memories . 
first of all , i ordered takeout and was told it would be N minutes . i arrived when they told me to pick up and i had to wait another N minutes just to get N bland boring rolls . they didn ' t even apologize for making me wait Nh N minutes and i got it on a slow tuesday night . there was no special sauces and the specialty rolls literally looked exactly the same as all the others but with a higher pricetag . i ' ve had much better sushi ( sumo sushi fat salmon ) within the same price range and will not be going here ever again . 
i now live in california . . . . and i wish we had a place that served healthy yummy food like this , there ! ! 
there are some that would say williamsburg needs another bar-resto like freeman ' s needs another hipster or lindsay lohan needs another girlfriend . but walter foods is definitely a welcome addition . the renovation done on this former divey space is remarkable and it has a lovely N ' s feel to it . the service is impeccable and the food was great . i can ' t say i ' m a big chicken wing fan , but i ' m still dreaming about our little chicken leg appetizer and the oysters . the crowd was surprisingly relaxed and ran the gamut from hipster to yuppy to the people that love them . walter foods seems like it ' s off to an amazing start . and hopefully they will be around for a while . . . at least longer than one of lindsay ' s girlfriends . 
the reading terminal market is a must for getting locally made goods in pa , fresh seasonal produce , or a bite to eat . my favorite thing is to pick up some delicious homemade cinnamon rolls from the lancaster county amish community . it is good to note that the stands run by the amish close an hour earlier than the market . also the amish are not at the market on sundays . this is a great place to take out of town visitors as well . 
to me , waiting in line in nyc for foodstuff has always been mind boggling lunacy . why why why ? when there are so many options in this town ? for macarons , this place really is the only option . perfection . personally , i still wouldn ' t wait in line , but i am glad to have friends that will ) i will never eat another macaron unless it comes from here . 
the best lunch spot in old city . the turkey pita sandwich is incredible and the calamari salad is my favorite ! ! ! ! the drinks are a bit on the expensive side , but they are delicious . there is a martini with tang in it that is the absolute best . with the warm weather , it ' s an awesome place to hang outside for some drinks . 
well im from philly . . . . . this is not the place i would go for a cheesesteak . i came here with a friend who came from out of town . well this is a good tourist spot but i dont think this is the true taste of a philly cheesesteak . if you want true philadelphia cheesesteak gotta go to the hood to get one
i have been here at least a dozen times . it is a fun place . the beer selection is meh . . . . . the food is absolutely terrible . all of it . the bathroom situation is miserable . i stopped there this past friday night . . . and oh how things have changed . the place was packed with pauly d ' s and situations . . . . . . wall to wall . girls with poofs stumbling around looking bad . the bouncers now reflect the clientele . the south jersey kids obviously found out about this place . say what you want about hipsters , but i would take them all day versus the bros . 
if you love garlic white pie , go here . i would prefer a thinner crust , but hey , the price can ' t be beat . better to eat it at the restaurant doesn ' t travel well , but i ' m used to nyc pies . 
very good service and well priced . a very good beer selection . i had the ithaca groundsomething . . . it was really good . the decor is awesome . rustic friendly place . the service was friendly . the place is large and got perfectfor large groups
really great place . unique atmosphere and decor . our server was great . i had brunch here and it was delicious
Nst , there aren ' t many late night places to eat in wall street area once the closing bell rings . the nice think about this pizza place is that it ' s open late night till midnight i believe . the also close off this little cobble-stoned side street if you prefer to eat outside ( recommended ) Nnd , the pizza is great . it ' s a bit pricey , but this is a sit-down eatery , not a N slice shop with cheap eats . the portions are generous . the original is great the N N N N it so you can get whatever toppings you want lol . the pepperoni was great fyi
great cuban sandwich . ( they called it something else , but it is basically a cuban sandwich . ) open , clean atmosphere in a nice town . 
creative to a fault . . . it seems that the chef goes out of his way to create strange sounding dishes . the combinations of ingredients sound intriguing and unusual but do not seem to taste very good together . i have a wide and varied taste range and usually like trying new things and creative dishes . this place just seemed like it was a tv show competition to use odd ingredients in weird combinations , as if the right things weren ' t available . seating is cramped and the room is very small . we did find the service to be pleasant and attentive . the location is in a gentrifying neighborhood and parking is very limited other than the expensive lot across the street . 
my wife and i , were there in september , and we enjoyed it very well . it is footsteps from the seaport . we had trhe chesesteak with onionsand cheese whiz sonny ' s favorite . and we had fries very good . a real piece of philly there . i especially enjoyed the area , it had that ny bleeker street setting . i love philly and that made me love it even more . you will enjoy sonny ' s the next time you are there come and eat there . 
last night we tried this restaurant and are now big fans . the place is small so you may have to wait for a table but it is well worth it . i had tom yum soup with chicken which had a delicious broth that was perfectly spicy . my husband had the silver soup with veggies and really liked it . for dinner i had the red snapper panang curry , he had the duck in basil sauce . both were fantastic . there is a small parking lot for diners and the place is byo . other than the fact that we didn ' t know to bring wine or beer , our dinner was great and we will definitely be back again . 
the food was nothing to write home about but the service was extremely slow . the N minute wait they quoted us was more like N . after we were seated , making our order took another N min , the apps took another N min , the food took another N min , and the desserts took another N min . i have no idea what took so long for us to get our food , when i saw most of the waiters standing around in the back not doing anything . we left two hours later tired and irritated . the food was lackluster . there were pin bones in my bluefish , the flourless cake was a dense brick served with freezer burnt ice cream , and the portions are small for the price . i wouldn ' t go back . 
just went there yesterday . amazingly delicious and healthy food ! the dinner plate portions were good with a variety of sides . the eggplant salad was yummy . the falafels were crispy and tasty , the best i have had yet . the food was freshly cooked and not greasy . good ambiance , clean , and the staff was friendly . the only regret was we didn ' t have dessert because we were stuffed . 
the worst restaurant . i ' m a regular and i ordered an order to go . not only did i not get servcice they threw my out of then restaurant sober when i started to ask where my food was . terrible service . over N minute wait for greasy unhealthy empanadas , 
been here a few times - perfect for a small group N-N ppl . get the balcony seating . best pork empanadas . and they mix a fine spanish manhattan . 
only four starts because it was a bit loud with conversation , music , and waiters chefs yelling orders . not the place to go for an intimate talk . but really great japanese food . makes my vegetarianism more of a distant past while i ate their pork buns . ( we had to have a second order , too ) ramen met my expectations . i tried my friend ' s but the one i ordered was the best miso ramen . ippudo has the best appetizers though a bit small . i recommend the ippudo salad and tako wasabi . 
went back with the girlfriend , and had a craving for meat ( so pizza will have to wait till my Nrd trip ) . i love any sort of meat on a stick , so the pork souvlaki was perfect . it was tender and flavorful , and i would definitely order it again . i always tend to forget about this place , and it ' s a shame because the food is so good ! 
N- really . . . . i ' ve now been at the bar , the cozy back room and upstairs . i wouldn ' t go back if i had to go upstairs . wine selection good , food above average but a tiny bit pricey for the portion size . skip the roasted cauliflower veggie . . . beyond over salted . overall i ' d go back for drinks and a few small plates . 
pad thai and spring rolls were great but was most impressed by their speedy delivery and unbeatable customer support . will definitely be ordering from ngam again . 
awesome breakfast ! pancakes were some of the best i ' ve ever had in a restaurant . donuts and jam are a must have . not the best coffee i ' ve ever had though . bonus points for having stevia . my wife had the turkey sandwich and says it is the best she ever had . 
let me first start by saying that i have eaten there on N other occasions and thought that the food and service had always been on par for the price paid . the last time we ate there it was a group of N and i have to say that we were very disappointed . there was only N server for our entire party ( no busser ) . our side dishes came out first then our meals followed about N minutes later . N of the tables meals were not prepared properly ( there were special instructions that were not followed ) . after we were finished with our meals we ordered coffee dessert , the espresso was the worst i have ever had and cold ! when we complained to the server , she said " our espresso machine isn ' t that good here " . i wish she would have told us that important detail when we ordered it ! in the end our tab came out to over N and none of the incorrect items and the N espresso ' s were taken off the bill ! the only reason i gave N stars is because the food was good ( not great ) . the next time we want to go to an upscale restaurant , i don ' t think this will be our choice . 
just stopped by for snack with my mom , auntie and sister . had sev puri and pani puri . very yummy food and extremely friendly helpful staff . 
absolutely delicious ! we were very impressed with our dinner tonight . in fact , i think i stated that i was in heaven while eating the freshest salad with homemade stuffed raisin bread , homemade pickled veggies , and of course , the pizza . can ' t wait to go back to this cozy joint . 
the food is okay . i would rather have my grandmother ' s cooking , but if you don ' t have an old country black granny i guess this could do . the catfish was okay my friend had the beef ribs he said they were good . the sides were okay , the fried okra and collards were really good but the yams were way to sweet . based on all the reviews i was really excited to try the mac and cheese , but it wasn ' t hot and wasn ' t good at all . also , this might sound weird , the food came out way too fast . they must not cook anything to order because all of our food came out in five minutes which is a little odd for a sit down restaurant . i get that you have to cook some of the sides or the ribs in advance , but it ' s probably why the food wasn ' t too good . 
i came here for a romantic date with my boyfriend . i loved the entrance ! this place was very hidden , luxurious and intimate ! the seating around the bar was a whole new experience . best foie gras i have ever had in my life . thumbs up ! ! however , the waiter ( can ' t remember his name . young , asian , short hair ) was rude . when he was changing the cutlery or bringing in taking out plates , he would not say a single " excuse me " " pardon me " and surprise us with his arm coming between our heads all out of sudden . other than that waiter , other waiters and chef were kind to explain every dish to us and provide a great ambiance . 
brooklyn fare - chef ' s table we had four people calling this place non-stop and one of us got through . yay . the german riesling ( by the glass ) here is the best that i ' ve tasted ever - refreshing , crisp , and sweet . the plates that were used with each course ( from france - le corquet ? ) were all very delicate , beautiful and modern . i just wanted to take each one home with me . my impression is that each dish only included the finest ingredients known to man . the starting butternut squash shooter with yogurt was very boring but the progression became more interesting over time . the beginning of the tasting included many sashimi pieces ( red snapper with ponzu , blue fin tuna , saba , shima aji , mackerel , tasmanian trout , etc ) with perfectly complimenting sauces and seasonings . there was also a kumamoto oyster with key lime gelee that was pretty good but kind of boring in my opinion ( kumamoto oysters are kind of like a starter oyster for people who don ' t eat oysters ) . the caviar course is great for caviar-lovers but i ' ve never been one , so it was just an ok dish for me . those dishes were the boring ones but they were very tasty . my favorite of the tasting was the seafood soup which included tofu , sea urchin , abalone , eel , and foie gras . the octopus course and the sea urchin with truffle were fabulous , as was the one with the lean foie gras , veal ravioli , and a couple of other items . another dish was the red mullet with the sea urchin risotto rice , which i thought was interesting but not as delicious as some other courses . the portuguese sardine dish was good . there was a smoked applewood dish but i can ' t seem to remember which one that was . the heaviest was the duck , which was cooked to a raw medium perfection with a little bit of fat still left - i could cut through it pretty easily and it wasn ' t gamey at all . the sauce on the duck could have been better . dessert included a tangy ice cream ( similar to pinkberry ) with lots of gold flakes on top and a cheese plate . i remember a red wine and port reduction sauce but i forget which dish it was on ( haha ) . there might have been lobster somewhere . i ' m sure i ' ve left out a few dishes here and there ( i did the tasting many days ago ) . chef ramirez can certainly be intimidating but he is also very attentive and helpful in telling us what we were eating . the crew definitely leave out the details in presenting you with each course so you kind of have to guess what ingredients are in certain dishes . overall , an incredible experience . 
on a damp , summer , rainy night , look no further than ordering some thai take out from topaz ! we ordered our food over the phone to pick up our food and it was ready and hot within N minutes . we picked up our appetizer , thai tacos , and wow they were amazing ! the bits of ginger over beef , all on top of a crunchy shell need to have this every day of the week . definitely squeeze some lemon on top , you won ' t regret it ! dinner was equally as delicious . i ordered the spicy basil fried rice with chicken and it had just the right amount of spice . it was full of flavor and packed with some great veggies . excited to be able to sit down and enjoy a meal here ! 
manhattan prices , montclair fare -- disappointing . my wife and i finally made it here for lunch with great expectations . she ' s a ramen fanatic and frequents many in manhattan and brooklyn . we ordered shoyuzo and the wing appetizer--a N lunch here . the wings were ok , the ramen was fairly average . specifically , the broth was pretty good , but you had to ration it . the overall portion was nearly half a bowl , and the vegetable count was low . chicken was perfectly tasteless . we were surprised and disappointed . when we had to leave early and thought to take the rest home to the kids , ani ' s policy is bring your own container . we couldn ' t leave the money on the table and relented with a quick cvs tupperware purchase . let ' s be honest . even a bowl of very good ramen should not cost N at lunch , and if it does , it should be ample and full of flavor . this was truly mediocre at best . i ' m sure the rents aren ' t low , but the only way people are going to stop being gouged by montclair restaurant pricing is to stop pretending the value ' s here . this one is what it is a N bowl of half-decent ramen . 
alright , alright . after giving this place another shot , the ramen was pretty tasty . and let ' s not forget the pork buns . oh so good . oh ! i ordered the akamaru modern , and my boyfriend ordered the spicy tonkatsu ! extra spicy ! i remember now ! this place is my boyfriend ' s absolute favorite place to eat , ever . the food is excellent , and i seem to grow fonder of it by the minute . mmm ! ! ! 
great fresh lobster . i had the lobster blt and it was great . literally had lobster claw meat falling out of my sandwich . great chill music too

N stars - i had brunch and dinner at this place and i might come back if i was ever in the area . there are interesting things on the menu but the alcoholic drinks aren ' t very good . for brunch , my boyfriend and i got there a little before Nam and we still had to wait about an hr for a table . they don ' t take reservations so go early to put your name down and you can use an app called buzztable to see where you are on the list ! we ordered the punkin waffles and the salmon wrapped poached eggs . the salmon wrapped poached eggs did indeed come with a black piece of bread ( dry ) . the salmon tasted a little too fishy for our liking . i liked the punkin waffles - the apples were a nice touch waffles were nice with soft center and crispy outside . we ordered a peach bellini and a pomegranate bellini - mm the peach bellini was kind of sour , pomegranate had a pomegranate punch but also sour and neither was very pleasant to drink . for dinner , i came with a bunch of girlfriends - we ordered the spinach artichoke dip ( so soooo delicious ! - a must order ! ! ) curry chicken salad ( pretty decent curry flavor , a little too saucy for me ) joey and jack ' s chicken pot pie ( yummy and hearty ) when veggie met sally ( veggie burger bits were ok , salad was underdressed and a little bland ) spinach and beets salad ( also underdressed - it says it comes with dressing , but not sure if we saw any on either salads ) chicken meatball sandwich ( tasted ok for something the waitress recommended ) . we also ordered a pitcher of the harvest sangria which sounded pretty yummy but was was just ehh . so to recap - hit and miss menu selection - spinach and artichoke dip is a must try . disappointed in the alcoholic drinks they have here . use buzztable to keep track of where you are on the list . 
nice ambiance , good food and drink . i always enjoy my time here . 
lovely , innovative italian cuisine . nice modern sleek interior and excellent service . i enjoyed the fresh tomato and burrata salad and the bronzino was also very nice . others in my group had the spaghetti with tomato basil sauce which was outstanding . the bread was so good we asked for a second basket ! i had the banana bread dessert which has an exceptional caramel sauce drizzle . the banana bread tasted hearty , perhaps it ' s made with whole wheat flour , good but similar to what i make at home . overall it was a lovely evening with very good food but it didn ' t quite knock my socks off . 
we had a terrific night here . went with another couple--ordered some excellent salads and good cornbread to start . for main courses two of us got the jambalaya ( great ) one burger ( very good ) and fried chicken ( also very good ) . beer was top notch service was friendly and efficient atmosphere was comfortable and laid back . we left before the music started , but we ' ll definitely go back . i say if you ' re wavering about trying it , go ahead and do . easily beats any place we ' ve been to ( for comfort food ) in maplewood , south orange , or montclair . update on N N N went here two times more for dinner and was less impressed with each successive visit . service seems increasingly disorganized . food is less consistent and we recently ordered inedible salads . entrees are still ok , but not sure we ' ll be going back for dinner . bar and band scene remains fun , though -- and still a nice choice of beers . 
we were walking by and noted this is one of mario battaglia ' s restaurants so decided to stop in for dinner . there was a wait for a table and we were directed to the bar , where the bartender was kind enough to let me sample a couple of wines before choosing one to have a glass . the wine was great . it was all downhill from there once we were given a table . i explained to the waiter i ' m vegan so ordered a pasta dish on the menu , that was to have vegetables , jalapenos , and be made with olive oil but without dairy . my son ordered the gnocchi special . we were not served any bread while we waited . my son ' s gnocchi arrived in a huge soup bowl , but with literally about N gnocchi at the bottom . my pasta arrived with no jalapenos , not even any olive oil apparent for taste , and only shreds of literally the stalk portion of broccoli ( who serves that in a fine restaurant ? ? ) . we were shocked at how bad the meal and service were , and complained to the manager . she comped my pasta dish , but overall couldn ' t have been more disappointed with the experience . 
unpretentious spot in nolita that makes you feel at home . my friend and i were there for dinner and we both ordered pasta . the service was friendly and the food arrived promptly , piping hot . both of our entrees were flavorful and hearty and left us full and satisfied . the food wasn ' t greasy and overportioned like typical restaurant food instead i felt like i ' d stepped into someone ' s living room ( it ' s as small as one too ) . affordable prices . great for a casual , homestyle meal with N-N friends ( any more and you won ' t fit ) . 
while visiting new york my cousin took me here . it was not only the most incredible calamari appetizer on the planet but the salads , main course and desserts are going to haunt me until i go again . the service was so personal . the owner is a hoot . . . prices are very reasonable . we had the best time here . i recommend it for impressing dates , just want a good meal or to bring out of towners . 
wow ! this place is amazing ! the owner , hassan , is the sweetest guy ! if you ' ve never tried chaats before , he tells you to tell him what meat or if you want no meat and how spicy you ' d like it then he makes you the best thing you ' ve ever had . as other reviewers have also said , he tells you if you ' ve ever had a better chaat or you simply don ' t like your chaat , it is on the house . the lassis are equally as amazing although , the lassi and chaat were too much for me to finish . i recommend to anyone even if you have to go out of your way to get there . if i lived in the area , i ' d be there everyday ! such a great experience ! 
i recently hosted my friends bridal shower in the back garden on a june afternoon . it was a really pretty space and shaded just enough so it wasn ' t too hot . working out the details of the event was a breeze . their event coordinator was very accommodating and worked with me on pricing and all the details including center pieces and custom menu ' s . the staff at the actual event was so kind and made sure everyone constantly had a full glass . all in all it was a very enjoyable time and i would recommend the space for any sort of gathering or event - ) 
such a wonderfu addition to smith st ! great food , trained servers , excellent ambiance . they have a different mussels preparation every day , too , so i can go back all the time without getting bored . just remember , cash only . 
i am just getting my feet wet with astoria , and so far i ' m in love a little bit . went to astoria for a night out and stopped at afton for a drink . what a cute place . dimly lit and fancy cocktails . it just had a cool , low key vibe . i am a fan . i didn ' t eat there , just drinks and conversation and it was a great spot . 
this place is great ! i went here for a working lunch and the food was spectacular . the family style portions of the veal parmigiana was to die for . if your looking for a place that has a sit down , family kind of atmosphere , this is the spot . 
not a great place for dining late . kitchen closes promptly at N pm . we were not allowed to order halo-halo at N N pm on a saturday night . other than that , the sisig was ok and the palabok was tasty . 
i ordered a sesame pancake , pork dumplings with cabbage , and pork buns after a short wait . the prices were excellent , even for the expected price of chinese food in this city . the quality of the food was good , a small team of cooks prepares your order in front of you . it is nice to see them make the dumplings , insert the filling and steam it in their bamboo containers . the employees looked unhappy , exhausted , and barely spoke a word of english . i walked away with the impression that the low price i paid for the food came at a high socio-economic cost to the employees . i ' m not sure if i will go back again . not all low prices are worth it . 
i was there a year ago and still remember it ! the outside seems seedy but when you go in there . . . it ' s very cozy and pizzas are great ! 
never thought that N a slice would be so worth it ! i was so skeptical at first , thinking , " what can make a slice of pizza so special ? " the ingredients are super fresh and its not like any other pizza you have tasted before . 
the other night was my birthday so i reserved a table of N ( which just also is the biggest table they have ) for a big and fun chinese ayce ( all you can eat ) hot pot . a handful of my coworkers and some friends from around the neighborhood swung by for the N N reservation ( yes they take reservations ) . with that said - they do take reservations - and if you book early enough you can book out all N semi private rooms that can each hold about N-N comfortably . so think of a party of like N can be seated and hanging out all having a good time . also - it ' s byob . they don ' t have a liquor license yet so they aren ' t serving alcohol - but if you feel like you want to drink - you can bring your own . not sure if there are any liquor stores near by but if you want to bring beers , wines , liquors etc . you definitely can . the hot pot is great - all you can eat except for some premium stuff on the bottom - but really - you don ' t need all that . just pick and choose what you want and you ' ll get everything in a timely fashion . there is usually a N hour time limit - but if you have a big group and if they aren ' t busy they won ' t bother you . just make sure you know what you ' re getting in terms of soup bases . just know that the spicy style is sechuan spicy with the pepper corns that have that numbing spicyness . they do have a kim chi version as well . 
i ' m a fan of prix fixe menus because the chef provides a N or N course meal that complement each other . so we chose ai fiori because its a short prix fixe ( vs a N-course ) --- the food was great but the main entree was so tiny ! i had the lamb crepinette and there was one piece on my plate . it would have been ok if it was a N-course meal but it was a N-course meal so one piece of lamb rack was too little . my friend ordered the ravioli and there were five pieces on his plate . so too bad that the servings were too tiny , otherwise the food was great . 
i love our oasis ! they have the best bacon egg and chz sandwiches . sound stupid ? well it ' s not ! have you ever ordered your egg over medium and it was cooked through ? yea well it ruins your meal no ? and the bacon is cooked perfectly ! ! the rolls are super fresh not to mention the owner and staff are fabulously friendly and i love it there ! the end
the food at pinto was extremely delicious ! the thai ice tea is superb . and the prices are excellent . awesome food ! ! i give this restaurant my full recommendation ! ! ) 
the only place to go for polish food in greenpoint . the polish platter gets it done . the farmers cheese pierogies cannot be duplicated . it ' s worth the trip . i ' m pretty sure its byob . 
a very good " after the show " option for a theater district watery . the staff is spit on antheir menu and wine selection are very deep . the bill will suprise you as you will get a lot more than you pay for . 
i bet if you conducted a poll - any poll - you ' d have a damned tough time getting a statistically significant response rate from williamsburgers . perhaps our apathetic ambition explains the curious lack of quality cafes in west billysburg . a tasteful living-room coffee house complete with piano , fireplace and board games , and serving up delighting delectables , coffee and tea , is in scarcer supply than our admittedly passive demand warrants . as a pleasant space to read or work , hosw is just . perfect . the faulty wireless allows you to check your email , but not your facebook feed the tasty , modest food and beverage selections don ' t distract . it ' s basically a library - but with food . cash only . 
excellent ! went w erica
someone bring me a falafel sandwich from taim please ! ! ! i love this place . don ' t mind standing ! i prefer to go here during the summer and eat outside . during the winter is hard because it ' s so tiny inside . all the N different type of falafels are great and tasty and so yummy ! i can ' t really say that these falafels are healthy since they are fried . . . but it is so good that i would consider it a healthy sandwich ) 
two words vegan sausage ! this is great pizza for anyone . and especially so if you ' re vegetarian or vegan ! you know how pizza places often assume that vegetarians want gross oily roasted vegetables on everything ? with no creative thinking whatsoever ? not here ! they have lots of amazing options , including . . . vegan sausage . it ' s delicious - flavorfull , no weird soy aftertaste , not too dry . even the meat eaters at our table loved it ! we arrived the minute it was open . the restaurant filled up immediately , so anyone arriving N-N minutes after it opened would have to wait for someone from the first seating to leave . very friendly service , fantastic lighting and atmosphere , and of course , delicious pizza . go ! 
went once during restaurant week . the food was good , but also cheesy . so not a very big fun of it . 
this place does live up to the hype . the paesano was everything i had hoped it would be . the brisket on it was amazing and the bread was nice and fresh . the egg , cheese and peppers rounded it out perfectly and made it just messy enough to give it some street cred . the panelle was good too , the chick pea pancake was really good , and it was served on a flat bread type wrap , the perfect sandwich for my little lady . i was a bit disappointed by the crispelle , it was too mushy and filled with apricot jam , it wasn ' t what i expected . if in the italian market defiantly stop here for lunch , but skip the crisplle , and walk down christian street to isgo ' s pastries for some amazing desserts . 
came here for the first time . i ' ve never had a falafel sandwich before so i thought i ' d give it a try . i ordered the crisp africa . it was pretty good . the falafel was very crispy ! i liked the peanut sauce they added . i wish there was more of it . the sandwich was big . i ate all the fillings , but didn ' t finish the bread . 
good pizza but both worth the wait . i prefer not to wait N mins in line just to get in , then N-N mins for your food . plus if its N of you , you share a table with strangers . the food is good but environment and wait makes me only give this place N stars
i don ' t care about the look of this place . . . when the food is that great , you go , eat and just enjoy . this place has it all for me great broth , some of the best noodles you ' ll find in ny and a great selection on the menu . oh , and the price point is just perfect . the noodles are prepared perfectly and cooked pristinely . i love soups or any hearty , tummy warming meals . this place brings comfort and happiness to your body . asians -- you know how to eat . boooyah ! 
grass fed burger done medium was perfectly juicy . slight smokiness to it , even tried to eat the crumbled beef that feel onto my plate . very simple , love that it was just meat cheese bun . side of pickles and pickled onions . duck fat fries were large , they only gave us three . more like eating potato wedges , but they were so crunchy on the outside . i don ' t know if the duck fat made a difference in the taste though , couldn ' t really tell . arugula salad with lemon anchovy dressing was sprinkled with crunchy crouton bits soooo yummy . i can ' t believe i finished a salad i usually take a couple bites for the sake of nutrition and fulfilling the food pyramid but this was awesome . for N of us came just under N without tip . small intimate environment good for a date . 
this is an amazing spot in williamsburg . highly recommend . 
i stopped here for a meal on my way up to northern vt . in short , the portions are tremendous , and the main courses were overloaded with cheese and salt . the waitress asked us right away if we had any food allergies , and reminded us that people do die , which was a bit awkward . i would hope that if you have an allergy to food you would let them know . otherwise the service is polite . the menu is quite large and poorly designed . i had trouble finding a meal to choose . the soft bread and olive oil was very nice . the half salads are big enough to fill you up , but if you decide to eat here , make room--the entrees are enormous . i had the eggplant rolettes which were overloaded with cheese--wrapped in a thin layer of eggplant . the flatbread pizza was way too salty to eat . i get the idea that this is a ' family style ' restaurant , but i think if they were to simplify the menu , cut down on the portions and focus on taste , it would be an improvement . i cant imagine how much money they are losing with all the ' boxed ' food at the end of the night . 
last night was my first time going to toro loco . first off the reviewer that said the food isn ' t authentic is clueless . the food is authentic and its really good . this is coming from a guy that grew eating at the best mexican restaurants in arizona and new mexico the guacamole is excellent . the chicken in my chimichanga was juicy and not dry and blend like many other mexican joints in the area . my wife ' s shredded beef on her california burrito loco was so moist and flavorful i was very impressed . last but definitely not least important , our waiter was super helpful and was kind . i only wish he would ' ve checked on us a bit more . i had to wait a bit to refil my margarita on rocks . i know right , first world problems . all in all we will definitely be going back and by far the best mexican i ' ve found in nj . 
it ' s even better than the east village one , but maybe that ' s because it wasn ' t as crowded . get the shawarma and put some hot sauce on it . it ' s delicious . but don ' t expect to sit down anywhere , cuz it ' s as tiny as the ev location . unbelievably quick service . 
this place is great , and sure beats driving to washington street for a mexican fix . friendly service . good parking . i wish they had later hours though . going to try the delivery tonight . if you ' re looking for a mind blowing food experience , you won ' t find it here . just a decent meal . 
love this place ! my favorite vetri restaurant by far . i especially love the swordfish meatballs but i ' ve never tasted anything here that i haven ' t liked . i think the price point matches what you get . 
a few formalities to be aware of before your visit ( N ) it just opened so complaints in other reviews about inconsistent service are unfounded , unrealistic expectations ( N ) cash only so far ( N ) no take out and ( N ) no veg option ( yet , but in the works according to the staff ) . also , i have no experience with " real " ramen prior to visiting this establishment so please keep that in mind . with that said , in a word , this was heavenly . i went just before the noon rush . seating is moderate and it was packed with N-N people within N-N minutes of my arrival . the atmosphere is modern , fast causal . the stero played great indie punk music in another language which i enjoyed immensely . there was no wait to order and i ordered the karai in the regular size with an extra side of pork belly . the clerk was very friendly when ordering ( and humble when i asked her about veg options in the future ) . i waited N-N minutes , my name was called , and i picked up my bowl at the counter ( forks are nearby for those unfamiliar with chopsticks ) . my order arrived before that of others perhaps due to a more complex meal waiting for an egg ? when my extra pork belly was ready , the chef hand delivered it humbly . he was also very friendly and i tremendously appreciated his efforts primarily running the lunch rush orders and hand delivering an extra side during the lull while i was already being satiated by the bowel of karai in front of me . a regular sized bowl was a generous portion and filling for a guy like me of average height weight . the karai was a medium spice in my opinion although i like spicy food so those inclined to less spicy options may find it more than medium heat . the broth was rich , the pork belly tender and flavorful , and the noodles undeniably perfect . a N-star experience in comparison to all other noodle broth experiences so far . 
the beef pho is delicious and the broth is almost perfect . i love spicy food but felt no need to add any sort of spice to the beef broth . the vermicelli bowls are also a solid choice . my only complaint is the service . every time i have gone the waitress has not been the most pleasant person in the world . 
unbelievably my husband and i were served uncooked rice and when we complained , the waitress simply said that they were having issues with their stove and did not offer any way of solving the issue she went about her business and when it was time to pay , didn ' t even took the meal off the bill ! ! the restaurant and staff have to class ! ughh ! never again ! 
i went there with my girlfriend to celebrate our one year anniversary ( her idea ) and the place overall was pretty good . we had the hot bread with the cheese which was amazing and the stuffed meatballs we had as an appetizer rocked ! when i ordered my dish ( shrimp and linguini ) i was a little surprised to see the shrimp still had the tails that i had to pick off on them but aside from that it was pretty good . prices are a little up there but nothing worthy of complaints from me . 
i spend a lot of time in montclair and discovered this place about a year and a half ago . i don ' t do desserts much ( anymore ) , but their efforts are so amazing that they are irresistible ( so be forewarned ! ) . the classic french pastries are as good as i had in paris . the macarons are also very genuine ( they ' re small in france too , by the way only in america do we insist on " oversizing " everything ) . espresso is as it should be short and intense . highly recommended ( great people-watching outside on church street in warmer weather ) . 
came here last night is search of a cheap dinner . i ordered the house special noodle soup ( knife cut ) and my friend and i shared an order of dumplings . the dumplings were great , flavorful and just the right amount of filling per dumpling . the noodles were good , the knife cut is most likely a machine knife because it was too uniformed to be hand cut by a knife . they were just the right amount of chewiness . i like the dumplings more than i like the noodles but i will definitely be back . 
great brunch . good food and friendly staff . in good weather the backyard is great for a medium size group , but the inside is best for just a people . 
you see a lot of these carts around nyc . i was skeptical about the food at first , but it ' s actually that good ! i ordered a chicken plate with pita bread and the white sauce they added on to it enhanced the entire meal . i just wished there were more options when we went , but it was still far from a disappointment . 
i wish there was a zero ! got a gift certificate from a friend for doing her a favor and i really wanted to just order out because my daughter is asd is doesn ' t sit well for too long . when i called the woman said very rudely that they do not accept take out orders and hung up on me ! looks like i " ll be giving this gc to someone who can use it or jus tossing it ! btw is this place a front for something ? who can afford to only open a few days a week for a couple hours a day ? ? ? ? really ? ? ? ? 
went here on N N N . i really enjoyed the atmosphere - super relaxed and neighborhood-y . our dining companions were a little late , but the staff was happy to let us sit at our table to wait for them . i had one of the fresh fruit caipirinhas , and it was really good ! not too sweet like most . the cheesy bread balls ( pao de queijo ) were delicious , as were both the beef and shrimp stews ( feijoada and moqueca ) . the portions were a little on the small side , but maybe thats the american in me thinking anyone needs to eat so much . 
yum yum yum in my tum tum tum . course numero uno - fries fries fries . just imagine it now and salivate with me steak fries with home made gravy and copious amount of mozzarella piled on top . course numero dos - chicken kansas city fatty slab of chicken doused with amazing bbq sauce , and piled high with melted cheddar . nothing has ever tasted so good at N Npm at night after a long drive from boston . course numero tres - an innovative concoction made by my future brother-in-law . heated balaclava with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . omg . orgasmic . please go here and make your nj experience complete . park west diner - you rock ! aaaaannnnndddd . . . . ask for lucy . she ' ll tell you what is up and what to get on the menu . seriously , she ' ll take care of you . ( btw , her real name is ellen , but everyone there calls her lucy . ) 
i have been going to the smith since i moved to east village . i love it , the tuna tartare is one of the best i had . i love the ambiance , the food , the people and the service . recommended . 
not bad , been their few times . great service , great food . 
ichibantei just opened in the east village this week , and features a range of japanese ' soul food ' , such as takoyaki ( baked japanese octopus balls ) , and karaage ( boneless , skinless fried chicken ) . they also have a variety of steak dishes , including a ' kobe style steak ' for N . i had the karaage the chicken , which comes with rice and cabbage , was well flavored and provided a good afternoon snack . i wouldn ' t hestitate to get it again , but i ' m curious about the rest of the menu now . in addition , the staff was very friendly ! 
this place is so amazing . the wait is horrible , we arrived at N Npm on a sunday and had to wait about N mins to be seated . i must say that the wait was definitely worth it . we started with the seasonal fig , prosciutto and burrata salad , which was just incredible , a mix of flavors . we had two pies that were cooked to perfection and very tasty . have been here several times , just love the pies here . we will definitely be back for this delicious pizza . 
it ' s a good day if i ' ve been to the farmhouse tap and grill . anytime we have company from out of town , this is our go-to place . never had a bad experience with service or food . incredible fresh quality in every dish , and what an incredible selection of fine local and imported beers . i ' m ready for my next visit , can ' t wait ! 
this place in the west village is the best-kept secret for italian food ! the food is amazing and we got excellent service . we did have to wait for ten minutes at the bar even though we made a reservation , but the specialty cocktail list made it worth it ! we will be back for sure ! 
just went to iris cafe for the first time a few weeks ago . can ' t really figure out what all the hype is about . coffee was good and i had the avocado on multigrain toast with soft boiled eggs , which was good but nothing special and probably something i could make at home . as for the no laptop rule , if i am willing to spend almost N on breakfast with a friend , not sure why the presence of laptops matter so much to the owners . i won ' t be back . 
loved it ! so declious and so authentic . the service is superb and you cant get enough of their food . so happy i got my gift certificate half off at wpst . com restaurant ! ! ! 
love this place . the portion sizes are great . the sauces are great . the mango chutney is my favorite . it is a small place but the line moves pretty quick . each special sauce is N . N extra while it may seem pricey but it definitely filling worth it . 
always great service . i like a bunch of the different guacamole and tacos . 
i have returned to le barricou many times since my review , and i ' m still in love . it remains my favorite restaurant . every dish i ' ve ordered has been impeccable . every friend i have brought there has raved about it . what can i say ? it ' s my spot . the service is always attentive . the atmosphere is always laid back . and the food is always a mouthgasm . if they have the grilled octopus appetizer , do yourself a favor and order it . it is superb . another standout special was the seared salmon , which i still dream about . if ordering from the regular menu , you cannot fail with the beef bourguignon , escargot , skate or cabecou . these are my standbys , and they only get better each time i order them . do order yourself some wine when you go . i love their wine list . . . 
yum . yum . great cheesesteaks . maybe the best in town , but definitely in the top N . and even better is their roast pork italiano . get it with onions and greens . their meatball sandwich is also out of this world . a few things to know if you are going for the first time they close at Npm . always order a large . the small rolls just aren ' t as good . there may be a line , but it moves fast and is well worth the wait . 
delicious dalessandro ' s . a little hectic to order because you have to walk through people eating people waiting on their to go orders . order is quick fast - as long as you know what you want to order , which all the locals do . service is consistent friendly . we would know - we went back N nights in a row . i preferred the classic cheesesteak wit real american or provolone cheese over the cheese whiz steak here . generous with the meat , as well they should be for a N . N regular cheesesteak . a delicious moist cheesesteak with grilled onions on a soft chewy amoroso roll . other prices bottle sodas N . N desserts ( like banana pudding , cheesecake slices ) N . N take out orders only they allow N free condiments sides ( sweet peppers , banana peppers , crushed hot peppers , pickles etc ) but after that , they charge because of the little plastic containers they come in . ( if you eat in , you can eat as many peppers pickles your tummy can handle ) sadly , they don ' t offer french fries but they do offer a variety of herr ' s chips . seating is limited but you can easily snag a seat watch tv or eat outside if you ' d like . location on a corner of a major street residential street parking free street parking
the chicken may be quality , but the portions were disappointing . maybe i don ' t appreciate french food enough to review this place as highly as others . oh well . 
when i went to " sazon " i ordered the bistec encebollado . . . i enjoyed it but i enjoyed the flan way more -hehe . anywho , it ' s a nice place to go to in my opinion . i was told the hot chocolate is awesome so i ' m definately going back to give that a try . . . ) 
unlimited sangria bar ? ! umm . . that ' s an automatic N stars in my book . i loved my experience here , even tho we got here when the kitchen was about to be closed and we were only able to get N sangrias in . their brunch is decent and with the unlimited sangria it was perfect . did i mention there ' s unlimited sangria with every meal ? they don ' t take reservations so get here early ! then you can get back in line as many times as you want to try each and every one of their N-N flavors of sangria ( i kept losing count of how many flavors there were with every giggle causing sip i had of the yummy liquid stuff ) . granted only two of the sangrias were legitimately flavored and the rest were fruity juices , regardless they were all delicious
really enjoyed this place . food was good but tight quarters . . . small bar and no where to wait for your table . they didn ' t have the porter house either , weird for a argentine restaurant . 
i would love to give a N star review and on the food alone i would but there is something very wrong with attitude of the staff at luca ' s . i have been dining here for years and love the food but i have been very reluctant to recommend this place to friends family because of what seems to be a management ssue . i hope they take these reviews seriously because the food alone does not make the total dining experience . i am glad to see others share their views on this in hopes that there will be some improvement the next time i decide to dine there . the wait staff on multiple occassions blames the chef rather freely for not being customer service oriented and they are vocally reluctant to ask the chef for a substituion request stating that the chef does not like these type of requests . i am not a big fan of broccli rob ( little bitter for me ) and asked for spinach instead ( on menu ) - the wait staff immediately stated with uneasiness that the chef will not like this request . 
it was awesome ! great service and food , little to no wait at all , and it was during the week . good choice for brunch with friends or a date ! 
verlaine ' s alluring N lychee martini and their sexy , mellow vibe have set the tone for many of my nights out in new york . beware , the martini is strong and one of the best i ' ve had in the city . it ' s chill , the bartenders are cool , and the crowd is distinctly calm and collected . this is a lounge for grown-ups , or in my case , a place to " pre-game " before i set off for less grown-up joints . go before N p . m . for the N martinis and see where the night takes you . 
i love noodle pudding . it ' s very cozy and neighborhood-ly , i always feel happy to be there the moment i walk through the door . the seafood , bean and vegetable dishes are the only things i ever get due to my being a pescetarian , but i have heard fantastic reports from my dining companions on everything else . if you want to keep it on the healthier side , go for the salmon with white beans and escarole or the shrimp appetizer which also comes with a bit of salad and a pile of large white beans . . . . sure , everything is doused in olive oil , but at least that ' s good for your heart ) 
price is good , and the food is usually fresh , good selection , the meat is usually of good selection , although on some days they have less types of meat than other days . since i ' m brazilian too , i guess i know what they have to offer . for someone that doesn ' t know the food , probably a N star . . as a brazilian , i would give N stars , thus , the average N stars . i would recommend , though . 
i like their donburi . 
tasty , delicious , phenomenal , authentic pizza . after searching far and wide we ' ve found the best pizza in east orange , bloomfield , orange , glen ridge , and montclair area . my husband and i love sicilian pizza and haven ' t found a restaurant that made them until now . hands down the best ever ! ! ! ! 
the food is excellent but the service has been quite poor during my last two visits . last night on nye , the " computer " lost my order . i wasnt comped or even given a free cup of coffee for having to wait another N minutes while my fellow diners eated their orders . nor was i even told what the problem was . and the kitchen was horribly slow as it was during a prior visit . disappointing after much better experiences in prior years . 
hi . i appreciate that it hasn ' t changed the slightest bit since i first went N years ago . same staff , same food , same cool-lookin ' menu hanging from ceiling . food may have even improved . i dunno . i like the bread they roll their sandwiches in . pretty individual . wonder if they make it themselves . thin but doesn ' t fall apart . 
broth is amazinggggg and vegetables are very fresh beef brisket cooked to tenderness chicken chop is perfect too ) platter is of big portion but mediocre taste
amazingly fresh lobster . i had the maine lobster roll and it was to die for . they piled high the fresh lobster tossed with light mayonnaise on a toasted , buttery roll . would definitely come back for more . 
wow this food is amazing
two of us had a very nice dinner at this south street italian byob . right on south street ' s western end in the graduate hospital area , this small place has an outdoor patio , takes credit cards and serves lunch and dinner . we started with a complimentary bruschetta topped with tomatoes and herbs , which was very good . the caprese salad , gnocchi and chicken parmesan were all very good . we also had cheesecake and tiramisu for dessert , and both were excellent , especially the tiramisu . the service was friendly and attentive , we didn ' t have to wait long , and you could see the kitchen from the dining room , which i enjoy . very good food . very nice experience . good prices . 
i must preface this review by saying that i am not a sushi fan so i have never had their sushi . the hibachi is great . the atmosphere ambiance is perfect and ideal for fun group gatherings - especially birthdays . the chefs are really friendly , impressive , and know how to get the crowd going ( and involved with the food ) . the food is even better than the presentation . the prices are also not bad at all , so you will still be satisfied even after seeing the bill . the only reason i didn ' t give this place a perfect review is that some of the staff ( who you will thankfully only interact with very minimally ) are rude and unhelpful . still great place ! 
great food , great lunch value
if you plan to dine here , plan to stay a very long time . service is slow , it took N minutes to get only two apps , then another half hour for our entrees . staff is not too friendly or attentive . food is over priced and portions are too small . i wouldn ' t waste your time . they will not last long . 
awesome foods to choose from . i had a full N course meal sharing apps and entree with my wife . . 
i ' d been wanting to go here for awhile , especially after i read that it was voted as one of the top N new urban restaurants by frommer ' s . i visited barbuzzo last week with a friend , and the food definitely did not disappoint . we split the sheep ' s milk ricotta , topped with a drizzle of balsamic reduction ( which was amazing ! ) , and the risotto for dinner . for dessert , we had the warm apple bread pudding and the salted caramel budino . our server was very friendly and well-informed about the menu . my only gripe was that the service was quite a bit slower than i would have expected . i ' m definitely going back and bringing more friends with me ! 
i organized a group birthday party here for about N people on a friday night . getting a reservation wasn ' t a problem - i called a few days in advance and learned that reservations are only accepted before or at N Npm . please note the restaurant does not seat incomplete parties . however , when the day came N of party was ready with only two on their way and the hostess generously allowed us to wait at our tables indoors and away from the heat . parts of our meal were delicious , especially the tequila-flamed mussels , the arepa , and what i wished i ordered , the paella with clams , mussels , and calamari ( pricey at N ) . the calamari was tasty but not the best i ' ve ever had . a friend described it as too ' potato-y " , perhaps it was dipped in potato based batter . my own entree , the grilled mahi mahi with browned coconut rice and jalapeno pineapple salsa , had a good description but fell disappointingly flat . the coconut rice was delicious but its sweetness was very one-note . the fish had no flavor or seasoning at all ! ( N ) two major complaints one of my friends did not receive his paella entree until after every one of the N other people had already gotten and eaten all of their food . his was the only dish left when all the others were taken away ! thankfully , my friend was not annoyed . he had been sharing tapas with others and the service was friendly . last thing - my friends and i had bought a cake that we were planning to cut at a karaoke bar afterwards . the waitress generously offered to keep the cake chilled in the kitchen , but when our birthday boy asked to have his cake cut at the table , our waitress explained that outside food is discouraged and there would be a N charge per plate . ridiculous ! birthday boy asked to see the manager about the policy and argued valiantly but to no avail . the manager would not budge , and all he got out of it was one shot of tequila for his birthday . a nice gesture , but i ' d rather have the cake . 
forrest point looked too cute to be good , with it ' s oversized billboard tracing green neon leaves and mismatched tea party tables and chairs on a rustic wood patio one senses a sort of N ' s new wave pee wee herman treehouse . an artsy space of mismatched reclaimed woods were balanced by a clean gallery feel with well done and not too conventional lithographs on display . the bartenders , a cute and personable young woman with a high voice who might be andy ' s friend in a modernized version of pretty and pink paired nicely with her own updated ducky impossibly cute lithe skinny jewish boy with big curly hair , a bit overly serious with a tender bright smile . " you can use my same glass . " i offered on a wine refill . " i prefer not to . " he said unsmiling , with conviction . i bonded with the chick . " what ' s good on the menu ? " " porchetta sandwich . " she said without a beat . i had no reason to doubt her . the ciabatta like bread wasn ' t overly thick and the chunks of pork were savory and flavorful . she gave me a shot of one of her favorite liqueurs , malfort . and she didn ' t even know it was my birthday at midnight . " it tastes like a thousand grapefruit rinds on fire . " " sounds awesome . " she had her own bottle with her and poured me a shot . " sip it or drink it however you want . " nearby some lesbian girls devoured one of the eggplant sandwiches followed by the chocolate ice cream sandwich on homemade cookies . ( i ' ll come back for that . ) while a man invited me to an art exchange called " gift basket " where N chosen artists get a gift basket of N unique works of art . forrest point shined like a golden globe of a fantasy land on my visit . maybe the planets aligned . i hope you ' ll find it as special , but for hip sometimes dower bushwick - there ' s some substance here . shout outs to the special bartenders who made my night . craft cocktails late night menu hipster
expensive but not ridiculous . trendy but not stuck up . popular but not overrun . if you ' re in philly , don ' t miss buddakan - if for only to behold the sight of a Nft gold talking buddha . ok , he doesnt talk . if you ' re cool try the communal table . dont worry , the anorexic mess sitting next to you wont steal your red snapper . oh , definitely try the pagoda house dessert . unreal . update the sweet mashed potatoes are woah , i mean they ' re good - i wanna be friends with them . 
i think best korean food so far , if you guys are in a group . def . try hot pot . it will blow your mind away
had many a great night in mollys ! ! you just can ' t beat it on a cold winter night . it ' s a bit quieter in the summer but it gives you a chance to hang out longer and enjoy the atmosphere . the food is amazing and the waitresses ( joanne and vicky ? ) are a riot . will definately be back soon . 
i am a trenton native and after some time away from my fair city , it is nice to finally have a place in trenton that has a great ambiance and a good vibe ( lounge set-up , outside patio , local art exhibited , dim lighting , etc . ) . so why don ' t i go there more often ? why am i not a regular ? three words service by benny . by far service here is slow and inattentive , even if you are sitting at the bar in plain view with an empty glass . but in all fairness , it is not all the service that gets under my skin . i actually enjoy the friendliness espoused by the owner , the chef , the girls that serve on the floor and even the owner ' s fianc e ( she is super sweet and has good business acumen - be friendly with the patrons ) . however , behind the bar seems to be the most rude bartender ever - benny . mind you , i bartended for over N years and understand the mix of personalities that come into a bar , i " get " being busy and trying to run a one-man show , but that is no excuse . against my better judgment , i took some out of town guests to trenton social on saturday . i actually made a silent prayer on my way there that benny wouldn ' t be on shift so early in the day ( sad , i know ) . note the other bartenders may not be the best cocktail makers , but they are polite . at first , i kept my opinions to myself to not bias my guests . however it didn ' t take long before they were all disgusted with his attitude and lack of service . after making us wait , he rushed us to take our drink order and then proceeded to get annoyed because we were ready to order our food . when one guest asked regarding the filet mignon sandwich , he snidely responded " its filet mignon on bread , what else do you want to know " . really ! ! ! the rest of the service pretty much went the same , he returned with drinks after a while and made no effort to give drinks or food to the person that ordered the meal , and instead he placed them down and left us to pass plates across a table of N of us . it ' s a shame a great place like trenton social has such an ill-mannered bartender at the helm of service . jackie trenton native
i ordered off of grub hub because it was the only sushi restaurant still open at N N when i wanted to order . the sushi arrived fast but when i opened it i was extremely disappointed . i ordered N vegetable rolls intending to eat one and save the other for lunch the next day . they only gave me one container with what looked to me like the equivalent of one roll . . . . so they either messed up the order , or their rolls are half-sized and they put both in the same container . then i tried it . . . . the worst vegetable roll i ' ve ever had , and they are pretty hard to mess up . i paid an extra N each for avocado and cucumber , which i don ' t understand because they were basically the only vegetables in the rolls besides lettuce ( who puts lettuce in sushi . . ? ) the avocado was brown and the whole roll was soggy and fell apart as soon as i tried to pick it up . i picked out some of the rice to eat but ended up throwing out the whole thing . never ordering from here again- N for basically one , inedible veggie roll . . . . so disappointing
are the new owners or managers trying to ruin this former gem ? though festooned with one too many wide screen tvs playing sports for our tastes , this was by far our favorite restaurant on staten island , just because of the amazing arugala pizza , as good or better than any in the city ( including otto ' s , john ' s , grimaldi ' s and patsy ' s , etc . ) . they also had a party special-- a large pie such as the arugala , plus buffalo wings or calamari , and pitcher of beer , for N total . plus , nice attentive ( but not suffocating ) staff . the pizza is still great , but the prices have doubled in the past month for this and many of the menu items . the special that used to cost N is now N for the same thing plus a desert . brunch is N for one person , albeit with N free bud lights ( yay----not ) . while we were there other patrons were also literally laughing at the new menu prices . this is not the sort of place that can support such high prices , not without a serious redecoration , which would alienate much of their existing clientele ( decent , well mannered , but not people who will regularly pay N per person for an omelette , a cup of coffee and three buds ) . to top it off , a new manager or host or whatever that big beefy guy is now hovers and stares at the patrons , like he ' s a co and this is a prison cafeteria . ( if you ' re reading this , no offense , you ' re probably a nice guy , just wanting to make sure everyone ' s happy with their meals , but seriously , you really gotta learn to become much more inconspicuous and not hover and stare , it ' s disconcerting ) . also , the new menus , printed sponsored by bud light ? tacky . exactly the opposite of what you want to convey when you ' re doubling your prices . lastly , i ' m not sure if there are new owners , or just new managers , or just new policies , but these new prices are a joke . we ' re not coming back until it changes , nor are most of the people we know . 
my god . this place . i don ' t really know how to elaborate on those first four words . i went here with my girlfriend back in december . it was our first date and i wanted to pretend i was a big shot for the night . this story ' s made better by the fact that she was well aware i was not and am not loaded . ( but i will be . . . ) anyway , the story it ' s pouring rain and we get into the restaurant . the girls behind the counter see me looking like a wet dog since i let my girlfriend have the whole umbrella , and they hand me some towels to dry off with . awesome . but then , even with reservations , there ' s a N minute wait . not so awesome . but it didn ' t matter . first trip to buddakan scores you a free plate of the trademark edamame ravioli . i ' d describe how awesome these bad boys are , but it ' d be like describing a color without just saying the color you can ' t do it . try it . then try to lick your own elbow . i ' ll wait . you done ? okay , moving forward . i ordered the pork shoulder . i have never been this happy with a decision since the time i got orange and black braces on halloween when i was N . so that was destroyed in a matter of minutes . my girlfriend got some chicken tempura thing that looked like sushi but wasn ' t . that description may make it sound like we hated it . we didn ' t . why do i say we ? luckily , i date a girl who doesn ' t finish her entire meal sometimes . so , since i was dropping N on food , i dug into her plate . in other news , the dumplings were out of this world . we finished up with the lemongrass consomme because sometimes i like to feel fancy , okay ! ? go here . just do it . i don ' t care if you have no money , imaginary person . go here and eat . now . 
i ' ve been visiting posto since it opened a few years ago . it used to be my go-to place when i wanted thin crust pizza . the pizza was always piping hot , thin and so delicious . i used to highly recommend it to friends who wanted to eat in or near gramercy , but i don ' t think the quality of their ingredients is the same as it used to be . this time , ordered N N mushroom and half jalapeno . the cheese has become extremely oily and the pizza very greasy overall . the sauce is not even tasty either . i hadn ' t been back in about N months after a similar experience . for an N thin crust pizza , it should be fantastic and i was again , seriously let down . 
i came here late on a friday night around Npm after getting off the train at penn station . it ' s a short cab right straight uptown to yakitori totto . we didn ' t have a wait for a table because it was late but the restaurant was still pretty filled . i was under the impression that yakitori normally takes a while to prepare but i was surprised by their efficient service . we ordered a bunch of skewers to try and i think my favorite is the premium steak . it ' s pricey but a must try . the meat is extremely tender ! i ' m not a big fan of chicken gizzards and soft bones so we didn ' t try any of that . everything we ordered was decent but the two skewers that stood out for me were the premium steak and the onigiri ( rice ball ) . the place is fairly small and i imagine that there would be a long wait during peak hours . i would recommend going here with a smaller party and either early or late in the evening . the skewers are prepared in a reasonable amount of time so it might be a good idea to order one each to share and then reorder the ones that you like . i will be back when i am in nyc again . 
i wanted it in and around my mouth . . . . . . once i saw it through the window . the cheese dripped down my face as i continued to slobber it down . mushrooms , onions and meat slid down my throat over and over again . my desire and the size of it had me choking . i always swallow . 
i went to this place on the saturday of labor day weekend with my girlfriend . we both were on our first time in burlington , and are big fans of the " brew pub style " restaurant . the reviews were pretty favorable , and this seemed like a hot spot to hit up , so we scheduled it into our weekend . there was a quick wait to be seated , and let me tell you , friends , it was not worth it . stay away ! we sat down at the bar , and grabbed a beer . it was warm , stale , and very mediocre ( two different varieties ) . the bartender was rude , and not very hospitable . we were seated in N minutes , about the same time quoted . that may be the single most positive thing i can add to this review . our server , alie , was either extremely new , extremely over worked , or extremely bad at what she did . she didn ' t check on us when our glasses were empty , didn ' t ask us if the food was cooked ok , didn ' t thank us at the end of the night , and didn ' t ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee at the end of the meal . come on . . . waitressing N , right ? for an appetizer , we ordered the " cajun calimari " . this dish was microwaved ( and served to us lukewarm ) , dry , tiny ( we ' re talking the entire appetizer would fit on a saucer ) , and had the smallest , least attractive pieces of calimari ever . it also had no cajun flavor , whatsoever . if this were my place , i ' d be embarassed to serve this to a guest . i ordered a burger and fries . the burger was actually pretty good , although the fries were nothing to write home about . she ordered grilled salmon . . . which came out as a minature salmon colored hockey puck . dry , overcooked , tiny , and flavorless . i know this is a brew pub , but when you offer three varieties of salmon on the menu , i would hope that you know what you are doing . again , i laughed as this dish was served . . . and the waitress didn ' t even stay around long enough to see our reaction . bottom line if you want a burger and fries , and to try some mediocre beers , this place may meet your needs . if you are expecting anything flashy , special , delicious , or even great service . . . stay away . i can honestly say that i have a very strong desire to come back to the city of burlington , but absolutely no desire to visit this place again . huge disappointment . 
love this place tho i don ' t get here enough . first introduced to it by my italian boss who took our entire dept here for a holiday outing thank you event several years ago . there is nothing on the menu that is not perfectly done , perfectly balanced and served with an understated , rustic elegance . the vibe is very welcoming and not snooty at all , even though the food is so good they could probably get away with it . this place is also the fave restaurant of a foodie friend of mine . you really can ' t go wrong at lupa . 
steve ' s steaks are far better , not worth the price or the trip ! ! ! ! 
pros building amenities . pool , gym , lounge , there is no other building in the city that you will have amenities like these . dog friendly great location cons doormen - always N on duty , yet none ever help you . they watch you struggle with N bags of groceries , luggage , hailing a cab . for the price you pay to live in the building they should be helping you . they just watch and sit on the phone with their friends families . especially richard ! units - very small , no view residents - a majority of the units are studios though they call them jr . N bedroom . therefore a majority of the people living in the building are students . the pool as i said is amazing , and beautiful , however laying by the pool is not relaxing as you have students wasted , making noise , bringing tons of friends , and acting like their on spring break . firealarms - always going off in the middle of the night or N in the morning . due to students , who fall asleep while making breakfast , or the restaurants in the building setting them off from cleaning their ovens . the alarms go off for abour N minutes at least once a month
this place used to get N stars from me . definitely not anymore . their food is great in-person , and they ' re nice people , but when i order delivery , i expect the same high quality food and service . i don ' t want a pizza that is impossible to eat because of poor delivery . i don ' t want mozzarella sticks that are raw , crushed , and have all the marinara sauce from the container spilled all over them . i don ' t want to pay for extra cheese just to get a terribly saucy and cheeseless pizza . come on , del rossi ' s ! you ' re so much better than that in-person . why can ' t you do the same for delivery ? ? ? 
i had the artichoke dip , mac and cheese and the mustard greens while here . the mac and cheese was bland and just not satisfying . the mustard greens were so salty that i ended up mixing them with the mac and cheese to combat their blandness but it was no help . the artichoke dip was the only thing that saved this place from a N star review . 
great coffee . good food . small portions . 
my favorites are of course the blueberry pancakes because that ' s what i always order and what i would consider N hours for . be prepared for a long wait . . . you can ' t seem to ever just eat here without a long wait . i would also recommend the eggs benedict there but most definitely everyone has to eat the pancakes here . love their syrup
N N stars for me . recently came here with my girlfriend and sat outside on a relatively early evening for dinner ( Nish ) . tables filled up , so i think we were a bit lucky . we have been before and have always been pleased . i thought the service was great . a friendly guy came to check on us quite often . i had the brisket and it was delicious . i had the mac and cheese and it too was delicious . she had a salad and it was delicious . bill was not horrible either with coffee and drinks . will certainly be back to try new things on the menu . until next time . 
wonderful place . one of the few bars that kept the pre-gentrification , non-posh atmosphere of northern liberties . unpretentious , but colorful . food that easily matches restaurants of higher price ranges . a great deck to sit outside . a choice of vibrant loud bar space , or more quiet restaurant atmosphere . inspiring people , always very good service standard tap is a gem . 
if you love bread then run to this place now ! really amazing breads , pastries and croissants . i would say it was the best i ' ve had in nyc . the coffee was rather average but then again , they are not a coffee shop so it ' s forgivable . the only disappointment was the attitude of our server . it was a snowy morning and there weren ' t many customers , no one behind us , but she behaved as though it was friday night rush hour . she seemed very impatient , barely cracked a smile , and acted like we were really in her way . aside from that , i will definitely come back again ! 
i ' m confused . i walk in , i follow the other people with their confused faces to the touch screens , i have no idea what to get , i press some buttons and hope for the best , i grab my receipt , i ' m not sure where to stand , i follow the other people that aren ' t sure where to stand , i realize i ' m going to be in the way , i wait about N minutes , i grab my little chinese take-out box , i walk out feeling like i had been at wawa , i wish i had been at wawa . i like the food , i ' m just not sure i like the way i have to obtain it . 
i don ' t know if they are the best in the city but they are better than the rest i ' ve tried because i find the service good attentive , clean , good fresh ingredients , they serve huge N oz beers for cheap , and they are open late night . i went on a week day so it wasn ' t so busy . so what ' s with all the different meanings for shabu ? i ' ve always understood it to be " swish-swish " as in the movement of your food in the boiling water . . . 
i would give this place a qualified four stars-- it is not the place for a taco that is blow-your-mind delicious if that ' s what you ' re looking for , but it ' s a fantastic hangout spot with tasty food , very very strong frozen drinks , and cheap beer . i went their with a friend for drinks and we were just looking to relax in a laid back atmosphere . the outdoor seating at picnic tables , pretty lights , and great location just outside the entrance to the lafayette c train makes this an awesome spot to meet up and start the night . we had the frozen mojito-- it was very good and very strong ( watch out ! ) . the corn is fantastic . but the carne asada tacos we ordered were just average . overall it was a fun time and would definitely recommend checking out for a great night outdoors this summer . 
awesome dining experience . worth the wait . i would do this every year to taste the different menus . lived up to the hype . 
waited forever . . . . . over N N N hours for N pizzas and the place is only N minutes from where i live . contacted the manager and was offered no compensation at all even when requested . i was just told " if the pizza is cold when you get it then i will refund you " . horrible experience . 
what a great place with great clean eating options . falafel is the best in ny ! ! you can get it in a pita or platter , i particularly love quinoa salad and the beets with mine , my wife loves the lightly grilled vegetables and the fresh salad . very tasty ! ! we also love the juices , they are phenomenal . we visit this place regularly and the staff are extremely friendly and always full of smiles . the manager has a well organized team and is very much involved in the quality of service . recommend this highly to anyone who loves the mediterranean food . also have great options for vegans and vegetarians , as well as anyone who likes meat . trust me the falafels i dream about ! ! ! they are awesome ! ! ! there are great options for drinks , food is great and staff are very welcoming and a pleasure to deal with . 
i actually came here mostly for the hot chocolate . i mean i ' m a fan of all things edible buttttt the hot chocolate was my motivator so much so that i ordered it first ( the food can wait ) . i went with the clasico . it ' s funny , when your palette is soo used to cheap hot chocolate , it ' s hard to appreciate good stuff . i ' m really use to the panera bread hot chocolate . . to me , they make the best " cheap " hot chocolate ( for me , anyway ) . so i was served my clasico with a nice heap of whip cream . i was a bit disappointed in the small cup it came in but that size was deceiving . it was really dark , rich and thick ( uhmmmmm sorta same qualities i like in my men , their wallet and their penis . . . mauwahahahahah naughty naughty ) . so back to the drink , it wasn ' t too hot as the owner rightly pointed out , the " cheaper " hot chocolates are made hot , but the real cocoa is not meant to be that hot it ruins the product . anyway , i don ' t have much to say about the food because i only had the appetizer ( platter and the smashed garlic plantain ) soursop drink . i didn ' t really have space for real meal so i guess i have to go back for that . i got street parking a sketchy one block away . . . creeeeeepy . i like the home feel of it ( owner ' s actually come out and interact , take ur orders , serve you . . etc ) . the decor is also very simple but neat . i appreciated that . . . no fluff . i don ' t wanna pay for fluff . i love me some biscuits ( has nothing to do with nothing but it ' s a great saying ) . so go check out sazon . . . and do it up like i did it . . . get the hot cocoa first . oh , they have diff flavors . . . i was scared to try them because i was afraid i wouldn ' t like them so i stuck to the safe " classic " bet . 
i order takeout from here N-N times a month . the pulled pork is amazing and well worth it . haven ' t eaten inside yet but i want to try the mojito they look great
great atmosphere . i live in the area and definitely will be back more times . 
i don ' t have a yelp account . i didn ' t ( ! ) until right now ! that ' s how moved i was by our experience . we sat and waited a while to be seated , which was fine . the most magical part of our lunch was our server . she first arrived to drop the specials board and lean it on the table next to us , which we both thought was a joke and then realized later definitely was not . she didn ' t point out the brunch specials board--which was unfortunate , since i didn ' t see it until after we ordered , and had some stuff that sounded great ( cinnabun pancakes ! ) they were out of the soup ( thanks ) . wildly inconvenienced by our presence , she somehow managed to withstand our company while taking our order . once the food came ( which , in the kitchens defense , was good ) , she disappeared , never to return , until she took our plates after we had been waiting for some time to get the check . here comes my favorite part we had already discussed how awful the service was , how cold and rude the server was , and that we , people who have both worked in the device industry and never leave less than N-N tips , would reward her with what she deserved barely N . when you use a card to pay for the check , it ' s run through a little tablet , which the server brought to our table . you ' re then made to select N , N , or N tip . nope , nope , nope . this would ' ve been okay to customize if she hadn ' t been standing over the table watching . it was horribly , horribly awkward , unprofessional , and just . . . . awful . she threw the card down on the table and said " have a good day " with some of the most impressive levels of disdain and sarcasm i ' ve seen . decent food , some of the worst service i ' ve ever experienced in my life . 
this restaurant offers kind of authentic mexican food . i recommend the tamales . the room can be very noisy at times , though . 
this is one of the best indian restaurant in iselin area . . . even though i am from nyc i work in islin so i have tried most indian pakistani restaurant . . so i would say this restaurant would be on my top N list in indian pakistani resturant in nj . . . . the food is prepaid right after you order so you know you having something fresh rather then food that is sat there for hours . . another good thing is the prices . . . an avg dish would run you for about N or N . . . one of my favorite dish in this restaurant is panner tikka masala . . . its one of their best dish along with chicken tikka and fish pokadaa . . . . 
very good food . very good service good too . the last time i was here ( a N . N weeks ago ) however , the bar smelled sour , kind of like it needed a good cleaning and disaffecting on regular basis . the smell kind of wafted through the entire bar . i hope they keep up the cleaning part . perhaps the place needs a refresh , but the food is great . otherwise , i would have given them a solid N . N stars . 
ordered the veal marsala and stuffed mushrooms . the veal was as thin as paper and only half breaded . tasted like jerky . the noodles were horribly undercooked . everything was flavorless and depressing . the mushrooms were swimming in so much grease and oil i filled a dixie cup with it . they were a soggy messy and nothing about them was distinguishable or enjoyable . never ordering again . 
the beer list is good , and the atmosphere is great ( sunday quizzo is usually a good time ) , but the food is hit-or-miss . sometimes the food is wonderful ( good fries , great chowder ) and sometimes it ' s terrible . on one trip the cook apparently failed to properly clean the griddle prior to putting my wife ' s burger down to cook - needless to say a hamburger that tastes and smells of fish is less than appetizing . the waitress was very apologetic , but that ' s the last time i ordered a burger there . as a side note , mccrossen ' s used to have one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches i ' ve ever had , but have removed it from their menu . it was truly one of the only reasons i went there , and likely won ' t be returning often . 
love it . great hearty food and good service . always a wait , but worth it . 
i ' ve been here twice so far , for business lunches . very good food , but small portions . first time here , i had the skirt steak , was very good . second time , i had this salmon omelette , served in the frying pan it was cooked in . i wish it was bigger or thicker . fries are fantastic and client i was with ordered the mac cheese . . . as much as i wanted to dive-bomb my spoon into that and try it , i held back . but i ' m definitely ordering that the next time i go back . 
we walked in as the place was closing the kitchen , but the owner said she would take us anyway . the food came out quickly and it was delicious . service was very good . as we were paying the bill , the owner gave us some dessert items on the house . 
amazing food , vanilla limoncello and atmosphere . gotta try the kangaroo ! 
this place gets N stars because of the efforts of it ' s manager . well , that ' s not entirely true . the food was absolutely amazing . it was about a year and a half ago that my girlfriend and i went there for breakfast . the place was fairly crowded and we were seated at a table that did not have a great view . we saw one that was open by the window and asked a bus boy if we could be moved , he said that ' s fine , go ahead . we were re-seated and the waiter ( looking flustered ) took our drink order . then we waited N minutes . still no drinks , it was clear he forgot about us . we finally decided f k this , let ' s get out of here . we told the hostess on our way out that we had ordered drinks N minutes ago and still hadn ' t seen them , then left the boat . we were probably N yards away from the boat when we heard ' excuse me ! sir , madame ! please wait ! ' it was the manager jogging towards us in his suit and tie ( and it was a hot day ) he caught up with us and said ' please come back , i apologize , but i don ' t want you to leave here feeling anything but satisfaction . ' we were on a meter but his persistence brought us back onto the boat . our drinks were waiting for us and our order was taken immediately , although at this point we ordered it to go as we didn ' t want to get a parking ticket . our entire order was there in under N minutes with an additional bonus of lobster bisque and something else i can ' t remember , and the manager comped the entire meal ! drinks and all ! we took it to a park and had a wonderful picnic . to sum up the manager of this place deserves a raise , i have never been so completely turned around in my opinion of a , and the food was some of the best i ' ve ever had ! kudos ! ps sorry it took so long to write this review , i told myself i would do it the following day
pretty much your typical chinese take out-- predictable and reliable . we used to like a different place , but china garden is our current favorite . 
really nice resturant , so cozy , so good food , so good wine . you just have to go there . a tips for you is to ask if you can get a table at the second floor . the prices are good , you can get a good steak for around N-N . it is a must even if you ' re from new york or not ! ! ! if you want to eat there the best is to make an reservation . 
i had the farmer ' s skillet which comes with a potato , sausage and assorted veggie frittata ( really delicious ) , fried potatoes and a buttery biscuit . the food was excellent and the service was very good . i like the inside decor which has some local art on the walls . the staff was very friendly and i would highly recommend coming here . i will definitely be back . 
surprisingly not totally weird to eat dinner a restaurant hidden like a russian doll in chelsea market . but it ' s still a little weird . food is good , but it just doesn ' t all come together for me . 
i haven ' t been here in years . i should have stayed away . i guess college nostalgia can only carry the taste buds so far . risotteria is to risotto as tad ' s steaks is to steaks . actually that ' s a bit cruel . still , way over priced for mediocre dishes . 
we were expecting something better but there aren ' t many great falafel places in nj . the falafel was so-so but not bad . still not sure how i feel about the pickles on the sandwich . . the hummus was average . we made a special trip to falafel hut since there isn ' t anything good near us . we ' ll sticking to what what we know in jersey city and highland park for now . 
veggie smoothie , fresh strong coffee and great mini quiche raise this beyond its competion . will definitely seek out again when in the area
jimmy ' s has fast become a favorite . what ' s not to like . super tasty food , friendly staff , and a totally laid back vibe . if you are looking for good , simple food in a low maintenance environment , this is the place . 
this sandwich was very good . i ordered it with bacon . lots of bacon on the sandwich . i took most of it off . also had the peach bellini -really hit the spot ! cute quaint restaurant . friendly wait staff . 
and it was indeed tasty . i got the house special noodle soup and it was quite a large portion too . i opted for the knife cut noodles and while some individual noodles were better than others , overall they were nice and chewy . i also added in some of the fishballs with pork inside . they were pretty interesting . think gushers but made of fish paste with pork inside . 
claire ' s is always a faithful stop for fabulous vegan food . i like the vibe , but i never go during peak hours as it ' s chaotic when it ' s crowded . i ' ve never tried their desserts , but all the mexican options , the smoothies , the pancakes , and the soups are so good - right down to the giant fluffy rolls that come right out of the oven . it ' s not cheap , but when has organic vegetarian vegan food ever been easy on the wallet - even in the grocery store ? worth it . i ' m surprised to see so many bad reviews . perhaps people aren ' t used to the way vegan food tastes ? 
tried both genos and pats . both are equally good . 
whoops . closed . . a new place is there . escape . . . 
honestly , i was surprised at how good the food is . the long line outside was not deceiving . i ordered the fried green tomatoes , and corn cakes . literally the best corn cakes i ' ve ever had . they were so good ! i can taste them now . my friend ordered the hot chicken , she said it was delicious . it was a little out of the way , but i ' d definitely say check it out . 
pleasantly surprised by the really good pho and noodle dishes . ate here several times while on vacation . prices were really cheap . if i was a local i would eat here regularly
great place i like the atmosphere food is great drinks are good people are so well educated love this place i really recommend - ) 
awesome food as always . service can get a bit scarce depending on where you sit or how busy they are . large space though and good for groups . be prepared to wait a long time at dinner time . 
good food but way way too expensive to eat here regularly . 
our favorite restaurant in burlington ! the penne bolognese and arugula salad are my wife ' s favorites and i typically experiment with the pasta ' s and specials . my favorite pastas are the gnochi with balsamic , cherries , and slow roasted pork ( as a starter ) , and the seasonal risotto ' s - always great if you like the ingredients . they have a great wine list , mostly italian varieties , and i love the basil ice cream with balsamic and strawberries . the service is typically prompt , but can be a little inconsistent when there is new staff . in mid- to late- winter , they run a series of special menus on mon through thurs from various regions of italy . they are N courses for N and are a great value . 
in the midst of burgeoning commercial food establishments , harvest table stands out as a glowing gem ! i love harvest table ! 
i probably shouldn ' t admit this . . . . but i went to masa twice in one week . don ' t judge me . my motto try everything at least twice . mission accomplished . that makes it okay , right ? all-you-can-eat sushi sashimi standard and special rolls , various appetizers , soups , etc . and it ' s byob ? ummmmm yes . compared to sushi palace ( on rt . N in kingston ) , the service at masa is quicker and more friendly . i haven ' t experienced a wait for a table , nor have i felt rushed out . the decor is nice , too . my little criticism at first glance , the list of special rolls looks big and exciting . . . once you start reading , though , you ' ll notice that the majority of the rolls are almost exactly the same ( mostly with spicy salmon and spicy tuna ) . oh , and it ' s about N pp ( a bit much , and slightly more than sushi palace ) . 
it was Nam , about N degrees outside and we were drunk . the line was about N people long . no joke . i ' m not really sure what i was eating but someone told me to ask for chicken and rice and at N am when you ' re freezing and drunk anything tastes good . 
oh my god . i have never loved salmon as much as i do here . . . ever . absolutely amazing ! ! ! ! ! miso glazed salmon with brown rice . . . . it ' s my new addiction . not to mention the fact that it ' s less than N ! ! ! and comes to the table in like , N minutes . come on , where in soho can you get that ? ! ? also , i noticed there doesn ' t seem to be a microwave anywhere on the premises , just an open air kitchen . . . pretty sure nothings ever frozen as well . rarity yea ? or maybe , i ' m just a bit idealistic ? i ' d like to go with the former . . . my tastebuds rarely lie ) we ordered the grilled squid and split the snow pea wonton soup to start . . . completely not disappointed ! the curry sauce on the squid was amazing , and the squid was fresh and cooked just well enough . the garlic in the wonton soup was absolutely fantastic , really great flavor . finished it all off with a bit of key lime pie ) which was a legit key lime pie . . . none of that awkward green food coloring some people seem to use to make you think it ' s " real " . . . limes are only green on the outside people . . . not on the inside , which is used for a pie . ahem . learn a little something . and i ' m not sure , but i think all the recipes are from the owners ' family secrets , yea ? so , awesome job mooncake family ! ! ! ! many fantastic generations of fresh food to come ! ! ! i shall return ! 
food N . N decor N ambiance N service N . N value N . N
trendy ambiance , affordable drinks , exceptional noms , really accommodating to both small and large groups . i had a really wonderful time celebrating my birthday here . thank you proper west ! p . s . proper ale is super tasty . 
they have the best pickle martini , cute bartenders and my favorite abita , cool place . 
was shocked to see so many specials that to my delight were mainly vegetables ! it was hard to pick only N . also had the chicken soup special with avocado . . . didn ' t come out super hot but was great ! definitely want to come back ) 
briskettown is to food as the beatles are to music . yes , that good . ever felt euphoria from meat ? no ? then give this place a try . they threw in a few extra ribs . i ate so much i had to go home and sleep afterwards . when i asked the guy " no sauce ? " he replied " nothing to hide . " he was right . 
we ' ve enjoyed two dinners here recently . the service from reception to farewell was excellent , highly professional w . a certain warmth . the room itself is one of my very favorite in nyc . however , david bouley needs to return to creating cuisine . his menu is somewhat tired and for a one star michelin he is out pricing himself w . the N tasting menu . desserts need to be changed . . . also there is no bar to relax at pre dinner . 
was my go-to place for take-out indian when i was in school . lunch buffet is great , and got fat off of all the galub jamun i had afterwards . reasonably priced , and would recommend to those looking for serviceable indian food . 
i ' ve been living a couple blocks away from this place for over a year , and i only discovered this restaurant through seamless web ! i suppose i need to trek out to the outer boroughs a little less and see what is going on in my neighborhood . this restaurant is wonderful ! we just ordered a pizza , but it was surprisingly good -- the nicest pizza i ever had delivered , in fact . the crust was thin , soft , and puffy . great texture , and it was pretty good by itself . for toppings , we went with the quattro stagioni which included prosciutto , mushrooms , basil , artichokes , mozzarella , and kalamata olives . additionally we added pepperoni . all of these ingredients were of high quality and quite flavorful . i enjoyed the rustically cut , spicy pepperoni and the earthy mushrooms . the sauce was really good too and brought the pie together . the only drawback was that the toppings were unevenly distributed . instead of mushrooms on the entire pie , they were concentrated in N-N slices and similarly for the other ingredients . i understand that you are focusing on each season with each slice , but this pizza would have been substantially better if the toppings were uniformly distributed , and i will try to order it that way in the future . looking over the menu though , i am very inclined to check this place out in person and try some of the italian specialties . definitely recommend ! 
pietanze ottime , piatti non banali , prezzo giustificato per la zona e la qualit . consigliatissimo . forse un pochino nascosto . cercatelo , non ve ne pentirete . 
great new spot by city hall . stopped in here after work one evening with co-workers . happy hour crowd had a very good vibe . overall manhattan proper is a nice clean bar with good ambiance and very attentive service staff . tried some apps and a couple burgers with the group and everything was delicious . will definitely plan to stop here again . 
i came here once for some afternoon beers with a friends and really enjoyed it . i didn ' t know it was on the second floor , so going up i was really surprised at the nice view and layout of the outdoor patio . the selection of beer is fantastic , it makes it difficult to choose . the menu is also pretty great . i got a pulled pork and hash brown mixture , which was the bomb . i would definitely come here again . 
my all time favorite thai food place ! a very warm restaurant with a feel good ambience . most weekends we end up dining here . my favorite of all is their mushroom puffs n volcano crispy tofu ! their salad dressings are the best ! 
i love this place ! its awesome to have a place like this in the area . i ' ve been here several times and every dish we ' ve had was great . try the blt , fried clams , mussels , salads , the also have a N oyster happy hour , and dan the bartender is freaking awesome ! 
tuckerbox is a great little cafe along the lonely route from boston to burlington . there appear to be a lot of solid options in white river junction , but this place jumped out at me , and i ' m glad i went with it . the blt - really a reflection on the ingredients you choose - was excellent , and their special kebab sandwich was even more so . pretty good value for this kind of fare and great service . my only grief lies with the carpet . . . 
we had a group of N coming for lunch and called them for two days confirming that they would save a table for us and they agreed to . so today we head on over after calling N minutes prior to confirm with the hostesses and when we get there they gave our table away . " we actually gave your table to a party of N . . . " and she didn ' t even apologize . never returning back , customer service is what makes or breaks a restaurant and they definitely lost our great business . 
reminds me of one of those places featured on diners , drive-ins dives . order inside and pick up your food in the back yard which features cafeteria style seating . there ' s also the option of sitting inside which has a vibrantly colored cuban decor and an open layout . i ' m a fan of their beef burrito and pineapple ginger lemonade . great chill spot . 
great food , polite service , cozy atmosphere . a good brunch . i hate insane brunch places , where you ' re smashed in like sardines , and the waitresses look like they ' ve been pre-gaming since N . la follia is nice , quiet , and relaxing . the way brunch should be . i had the steak eggs , which was delicious and of a very generous portion . all in all , i was pleased , and would happily return if i found myself in the neighborhood again . 
super nice place in the nabe ! ! ! small , clean and the panini ' s are very good . i got the pN prosciuto , mozz , tomato and pesto , my husband got the grilled chic , mozz and tomato and put balsamic on and it was very good . served with a little salad of spring greens and grape tomato and a basil dressing . he also got the beef barley soup which was very good too . we shared the apple cinnamon crepe with caramel sauce and it was also very good . we just love it and it ' s N minutes from the house . try the cafe frappe , yummy ! so nothing bad to say about this place at all . go and enjoy . they also deliver . 
there has got to be some sanity in the review section . i went to do or dine on valentines day with my girlfriend , after a long hard day of busting my ass . first thing i asked for was a cup of coffee , and honest to god , the waitress told me " we don ' t serve beverages here . " to put it plainly , i was furious . i don ' t drink alcohol so there was nothing for me to drink but water . the entire meal , they were playing music i actually like , but playing it ironically ( i know that sounds weird but you could tell if you were there ) , which pissed me off even more . i ordered steak , and they didn ' t ask me how i wanted it cooked . when it came , it actually was a delicious flavor , but the meat was tough and chewy ( it was supposed to be flank ) , which frustrated me . and there was no salt anywhere . my girlfriend is a vegetarian , and she basically was presented with a N plate of leaves , all arranged very nicely , and flavorful , but vastly insubstantial . the general vibe i got was that the maintenance of their hip atmosphere was far more important than satisfying the customer . apparently , at do or dine , the old addage " the customer is always right " does not apply . if not for the beauty and grace of my date , i would have a . lost my cool and b . had a terrible time . that i had a great dinner was in no way contributed to by the restaurant , service , atmosphere , or food . i will say the appetizers were fantastic , i can ' t lie . when the check came , i slapped a one hundred dollar bill on top of it and waited about N minutes in the emptying restaurant for the waitress to come pick it up , as though they had somehow forgotten me ? i don ' t understand why that took so damn long . so , they get N stars , rather than one , for the following reasons . N . they are competent food-wise . N . there probably are some people who want to be abused in the way that we were when we went there , who would see it as a validation of their hipsterness . N . its not my taste , i guess , but they clearly have got something specific going there and are very accurately achieving it , even though i think it ' s bullsh t . 
i used to go there on a regular basis , its very convenient to my office so i went when i needed a quick business lunch this place was great . the food was okay . last time there the owners son said they didn ' t take american express credit cards so i now go to a local diner . i am not about to open another credit card because this business owner or his son is not intelligent enough to negotiate a better rate with american express . this occured over a year ago , i estimate they missed out on N visits by me with an average of N people per party but sometimes as many as N but never less that N . the park west diner suits us fine now . 
there r many halal food cart in nyc , but somehow this one is famous , i had chick over rice , i didn ' t think it was all that , the chicken was a bit too shredded and dry , others were pretty much the same taste as others
i recently visited the smith with a friend and was thoroughly impressed . the atmosphere is perfect for someone my age , a fresh college graduate , as it was a bit loud and filled with energy . i sat tucked in a corner an had a full view of the entire restaurant . i found it interesting that they have a rather large table in the middle of the restaurant where people of different parties can sit together and mingle . as for the food- delicious . the best meat i ' ve ever had . so tender you didn ' t need to cut it with a knife . ( i had some sort of braised ribs with potatoes , i don ' t recall the actual name . it was the only one like it on the menu though . ) i would certainly go back anytime ! tasty . 
best service in west philly . the bagels are delicious , the coffee is good , the fresh-squeezed oj is to die for , but the stars really go to the service . i have only sat down to eat at the gsc once or twice , but the counter service is friendly , prompt , efficient , and fun ! i can honeslty say its the best in west philly . the green line cafe ( both locations ) make you feel like you are wasting their time ( and no this isn ' t based on N or N instances . i have probably been there about N times since i moved here bc the cherry apple walnut bagel is the best in phila . ) , and the milk and honey has the worst service of any cafe i have ever been to in my life ( ranging from getting ignored by the counter staff to being treated like a piece of crap for not knowing that their credit machine doesn ' t include tip . the food at the gold standard really isn ' t out of this world . the modena salad is pretty good and fresh , and the bbq seitan is also only " ok " , but for real , if you are looking for somewhere to get a good cup of coffee and breakfast to go without immediately regretting walking in the door , this is your place ) 
this place is one of the best restaurants i ' ve been to ! the ambiance decor is wonderful ( very romantic and good for a date , but also a good place for a nice group dinner as there were several groups too ) , the service was on point and amazing and the food was incredible ! i would give this place N stars if i could . quick review is - absolutely amazing . you def should try this place ! went for dinner with my boyfriend and we were seated in the garden room which has a retractable roof that they open in the spring summer when it ' s warmer and i ' m sure it ' s beautiful . we can ' t wait to go back when the weather warms up . here ' s a breakdown of what we ordered drinks - la gitana - awesome ! it tasted kind of like a tea mojito -verde sobre blanco - my boyfriend ordered this and loved the flavors . he said it reminded him of mexico appetizers -tostas de boqueron - i know it sounds weird because it has anchovies , but they make it work ! i normally avoid everything anchovies , but i ate N of these they were so good ! -croquettas - amazing with great flavor - panceta con calabeza - some of the best pork belly i ' ve ever had . and it was a large piece . they are very generous with portions here -codorniz con membrillo - they ' re like mini chicken wings wrapped in bacon . very delicious , so tender and moist . excellent entrees -pollo campero - so delicious . this chicken is soooo tender and moist . it had great flavor , was a very nice portion size ( i had some to take home ) and the beans and greens it comes with is a perfect blend . -porcella - also delicious and a very generous portion . even the salad it came with was delicious ( my bf who does not eat salads even ate it ! ) dessert -flan - omg get the flan . i do not like flan , but i loved their flan . it was the perfect creamy texture with just the right amount of caramel . -blanco y negro - this one was also good . the chocolate custard was very rich and creamy and was a strong contrast to the bizocho ( just like black white ) the waiters were so polite and professional . you can literally see them monitoring the tables and making sure everyone is happy and they ' re available if anyone needs anything . at one point the hostess sat N people at a table and they all piled their coats on her and she was still very professional and handed each of them their menu , despite being bogged down with N large winter coats ! our waiter was also extremely helpful and polite and cracked a couple jokes with us . he made sure we were pleased with everything and made sure our water glasses were never even close to empty ( i noticed at every table water glasses were also frequently refilled ) . we trekked out all the way to Nth ave in N degree weather and both agreed this place was worth it and we would do it again ! 
nyc is a tough place to find great vietnamese food . there ' s just no getting around that simple fact . having said that , ss is my favorite . i prefer it ' s pho to all others in nyc when i rate it overall . one other place has a better tasting broth , but pho is ultimately about the whole dish . holistically-speaking , their pho is tops . relatively normal prices , quick service , better atmosphere than typical vietnamese dives , yet able to pull all of this off without any significant compromise of authenticity . can be impossible to get a table , though ! yikes . . . 
the best shanghai food in manhattan for real ! ! ! definitely order the pork dumplings ! my husband and i can ' t go anywhere to try shanghai food now because we don ' t think anywhere else will be as authentic ! 
this definitely is one of the best burger place in the city . one of my friends compared it with shack shake , and he believes umami is better than shack shake . i would not said so . i think both of their have their own merits . i ordered truffle burger medium rare and sweet potato . truffle burger is pretty simple . there are only truffle cheese and meat in the burger . there is no tomato or lettuce inside so that we could just focus on the taste of meat . the meat is really good especially when it comes with truffle cheese . it makes the burger be a little bite crispy and sweet . i would say the truffle cheese plays a very good role in the burger . and they are a little bit more expensive than shack shake . but its definitely worthy to try . 
the hostess was very rude ! waitress doesn ' t come often . although the food is awesome , i wouldn ' t recommend it if you enjoy good service ! also very hard to get a seat in at any time . 
i went to this place because my coworker who is an indian from punjabi recommended it because of dishes with goat meat . i don ' t like goat meat , so i skipped these dishes , but their chicken tikka masala , chicken curry , butter chicken , paneer makhani , chana masala and biryani ( both goat and chicken ) are very good . no aloo bhindi which is my favorite . they have at least N-N dishes with goat meat which is quite rare for an indian buffet in central nj . as a matter of fact , this place is more pakistani than indian . that ' s why they have sikh kobabs , fried fish , and macaroni salad ( ? ? ? ) in the appetizer section of the buffet . the naan is out of this world . it ' s the ultimate in crispiness . they also have more variety in desserts than any other similar buffets around . moreover , they have at least N different sweets desserts sold by the pound in the front of the store ( i think it ' s N . N lb ) . three flat-screen tvs , each dedicated for broadcasting domestic pakistani indian tv stations . very clean place and friendly service . go for lunch early ( starts at N Nam ) so you won ' t complain that there is no meat in biryani . ) 
eat here ! this place is amazing ! i was skeptical after reading all the hype about this place , and then seeing the foodie fridge magnet style menu that lacked any details about the dishes . we had a couple of inspired cocktails . the cabbage and maitakes were available for me without the meat and were incredibly rich and flavorful . the veg pasta was lemony and pure silk . what a treat . seriously . go now while it ' s cold out and you ' ll have all the deliciousness to yourself . 
love coming here for a quick lunch outing . service is quick and the lunch specials are under N , comes with a bowl of soup , and the portions are normal entree sized . i dont know how authentic the food is since malaysian food is a bit fusion to begin with but it does taste good to a person who eats in chinatown on a regular basis . the atmosphere is nice - wooden setting , hand painted artwork by a local asian american artist , and low lighting ( you can read your menu clearly and see your food but it can have a romantic feel to it ) . the bathroom is also clean which is always a plus in chinatown . i recommend the roti and mango chicken over rice . 
it was an " ok " restaurant . it ' s surely average because i don ' t think you can do too much fusion to mexican food as to let say french chinese or cuban cuisines and make it hype . the service was good , the ambience was nice . carne asada is so-so as are the crab enchiladas . the el vez dessert is fair . 
the restaurant is now located on N battery street in burlington and has a much better set up with all the same great food , fantastic margaritas , and vermont microbrews on tap ! 
screw the paninis - get the crostinis ! ( at least , i prefer high content-to-bread ratios ) . we ordered a bunch of crostinis to share , and unfortunately i will not go into an intelligent critique of any of them , since they were all delicious - just go and enjoy . drinks - i ' m not a big beer person , but i fell in love with crabbies ginger beer . it ' s unfortunate that crabbies isn ' t more commonly available . service - friendly , chill , cute . the place itself is laid back ( but it ' s busy , so make your reservations and get there on time . ) price - well worth what i paid . nice to have a break from city prices . i generally don ' t like going to the same restaurant twice , but i ' m definitely making the trek back here for ginger beer and crostinis . 
love this place ! went here for a private party and was really surprised when i walked into the space . about as intimate and warm as you ' ll find in all of new york . i almost felt like someone invited me over for dinner at their home . anyway , the chef , jehangir mehta was incredibily personable and genuinely seemed to enjoy getting to know all the guests . so refreshing to meet a down to earth chef , especially one who ' s featured pretty prominently on tv ( iron chef , martha stewart ) . the food was refreshingly light and i loved the emphasis on real , whole food , and simple yet delcious flavors . great experience . i ' m definitely going back ! 
went back with a friend the other day , and wow ! ! ! had a really great time ! this time everything was good . service meal , and drinks were great . maybe it was the company i was keeping that night . anyway a much better epxperience . 
i love jimmies . but , after reading the reviews i think robert irvine of " restaurant impossible " should be called . would love to see what he would do . i love the belly clams and the cole slaw
el vez is one of my favorite places . the margaritas are always so delicious and nothing beats the nacho mamas ) . a great place to hang out with friends and just relax . i recommend the fish tacos and the guac . it is on a great block and service is always great ! make a reservation in advance - they fill up quick ! 
great pizza . love the sauce . yeah . . . love it
the beer selection is constantly rotating , and the person choosing them has excellent taste . the menu rotates regularly too . i don ' t get to go that often due to its location , and every time i do there are new things to try . they really know their way around a deep-fryer . i recommend the okra if you see it on the menu or as a special . they also make my absolute favorite veggie " burger " in the whole city . it always tastes like it came off of someone ' s backyard grill , and is made out of lots of wholesome ingredients . service can range from average to molasses-slow in the dining room , but the bartenders are always on top of their area , and generally awesome in many ways . if i somehow was forced to live in this neighborhood , memphis taproom would be the thing that would make it tolerable . 
the frozen mousse tart thing that comes with plum ( super sour tart ) and bacon flavored popcorns interesting but not my thing . the salmon was very good . the beef was nice with the b arnaise but some of the bits of the meat couldn ' t be chewed overall pleased with the experience . 
i really love romeo ' s ! i am always going there for the dinner specials on the weekends and pizza and salads during the week . i have N kids and they are always asking for romeo ' s . my husband and i go often to eat on the dine in side and the service is always superb . they give you the bruschette with your drinks and bread , so if you are starving you have something to eat right away . we went last night and there was a wait and that is a good sign . the owner is always there walking around to see how everything is . i love the fact that it is family owned and we always are treated special . 
i had a friend and his girlfriend head into town for his birthday . he read about this place a couple weeks prior and requested we try it out to celebrate . i hesitate to dole out a perfect score , but i truly cannot tell you one thing i would have changed about our experience . they do not take reservations . we arrived at around N Npm on friday night , and were seated by just after N Npm . long wait , but the hostess took our name and phone number so we could go drink at the surrounding bars , and we were texted when our table was ready ( which happened to be exactly when she projected it would be ) . apps we began with the artichokes and the tomato with basil and burrata . artichoke portion was small , but i felt appropriately so . and both were phenomenal . entree i got the monster prawns while the other three got the hanger steak . the prawns were truly monster and incredibly tender flavorful . but the steak - the steak - was out of this world . i ' m not the biggest red meat eater , thus my choice of entree . but when i go back , i ' ll be ordering the steak - mark my words . sides pan fried garlic truffle oil mashed potatoes , cauliflower , and scorched shishito peppers . all great , no complaints here . dessert lemon cheesecake with blueberry compote . light but rich , tart but sweet . perfection . we also ordered a bottle of red ( sorry , not sure which , we let the birthday day boy choose ) , and i got a glass of white from their wine tap . mine was very crisp , acidic , and great with the prawns , as promised by our server . cost four people , N apps , N entrees , N sides , N dessert , N bottle of wine , N glass of wine . just under N . N . i generally maintain a strict budget when dining out , so this was a rare night of splurging for me . however . . . i would have paid another N . truly . service the hostess was slightly offstandish upon our arrival , which is never okay , as she is the first impression clients get as they walk through that door . but in her defense , the line of wide-eyed , ravenous , drooly patrons was impressively long . nonetheless she performed her job efficiently , and she perked up as the line dwindled . our server was not only pleasant and knowledgeable , he was helpful without becoming an imposition . we were never wanting for anything , and never pestered by his service . as i told my coworkers the following monday - this may be the best meal i ' ve had in nyc . 
i loved the antibiotic- and hormone-free chicken breast with creamy guacamole and locally-sourced bread . nice beer and cider selection on tap . great spot overall . 
we have been here three times for lunch and have never been disappointed . the burgers are thick , juicy and incredibly tasty -- substantially better than plan b . and the beer menu is fantastic ! if you can ' t decide on a beer based on reading the list , you can ask for a small taste of two or three to help you make a final selection . our servers have always been attentive and helpful in choosing the beers . the interior decoration has an industrial steam punk vibe that i find interesting . 
this place is a keep ! great environment , delicious food , nice service and reasonable price . what else i can ask for ? the duck and salmon salad were amazing , the octopus was tasty too . the mosquitos in the patio reminded me this place is real . i ' ve been collecting this kind of places in city for a while , great meal and environment that me and my girlfriends can enjoy eating and talking for hours ( without paying too much ) i may delete this comment when i feel selfish . 
our first time giving them a try is our last time . the guy taking orders is too busy chatting with the guy behind the register to actually listen to what you order . after N mistakes we finally got our correct order . the pizza was just ok but the calzone was awful . the dough was still totally raw on the inside . i bit into it and could only taste raw dough . i took it back for a refund and did not receive an apology . just " ok that is N . N here i ' ll give you N . N " and that was that . when i said " seriously ? not even an apology ? you served me an uncooked item ! " he sarcastically said " oh ok ma ' am i ' m sorry " . we will not go back . horrible food and horrible service . don ' t waste your time . there are plenty of better pizza options in the area . 
might quinn reminds me of fette sau except the food has more delicate presentation and they give you a bunch of pickled veggies to go with the meats . we got brisket , spare ribs , and brontosaurus rib . brontosaurus rib was the highlight as it is juicy , tender , and uniquely spiced . also love the fact that it came in a huge chunk ! brisket is seasoned slightly heavier than fetter sau ' s , and i would prefer a little less seasoning . pickled veggies help balancing out the greasiness of the meats , a great addition to the plate . also worth mentioning are the homemade ice tea and ice cream sandwich . the lemon flavor ice tea is refreshing and goes great with bbq meats . finish a bbq meal right with ginger flavor ice cream sandwich . fyi - might quinn has a stand at smorgasburg , but the line is among the longest . i ' d recommend coming to the east village location instead of soaking in the sun for half an hour for a plate of juicy meats . 
pretty much a pulp fiction moment here . . . a N burger ? well with the carmelized onions and the gruyere cheese , i ' ll have to admit i don ' t know if it ' s worth N but its a damn good burger . 
i ' m a big fan of eataly and all it has to offer . granted , it ' s a little overwhelming inside , but i find their fish and meat selection expansive and fresh , as well as the fruits and veggies . for so long i have been purchasing whole foods fish to cook for dinner , eataly has put a stop to that . they always have wild fish which i greatly prefer to farmed . their homemade pasta selection is amazing , try the squid ink linguini ! although it can get very hectic , i really like to go to eataly for their meat and cheese platters . they have great options , including many types of mozzarella cheese , my favorite . good wines by the glass and pretty good service for how busy it is . if you go to the pasta restaurant get the pappardelle with the veal ragu . . . bomb . 
ate here for brunch with my family . cool little restaurant . make a reservation ! seating is pretty small . brunch portions were tiny but enough to share for N people . i had the champorado . that seems to be the only vegetarian safe item on the menu . it was really delicious . chocolate , coconut milk , sweet , but not too sweet . i also had some garlic fried rice but i think it was cooked in meat , yuck . for omnivores and foodies , this is a culinary delight . bottomless mimosas keep the party going . they also serve coconut water from the young coconut itself ! too bad that they waste the meat ! i definitely like the decor of the restaurant , modern , clean , but not cramped . staff was friendly and helpful . we were pretty loud but no one gave us a hard time , heehee ! oh and jamz ! ! ! ! ! their music was off the chain yo . 
well this place is just ok . . . if you compare how long you have to wait to eat here . . . to the quality of the food . . . its just not that great . . not waiting the hour and a half . . . . theres much better places to do brunch in the area . . . 
this place makes very nice sushi . the waitress was very nice and gave us really good recommendations . the appetizer tuna carpaccio is great and the crazy roll is also great . my only complaint is that the taste of wasabi is a little bit mild . 
i ' m a huge fan of guacamole- i ' ve been ordering delivery a few times each week for the past few months , and have been in a few times as well . the food is consistently delicious , always fresh , and authentic . by far the best mexican you ' ll find around university city , with great customer service as well ! highly , highly recommend it . 
the last time we ate at aksum , it was a very unsatisfactory . the grilled calamari were tasteless and rubbery . the lamb shank was inedible . i posted a review on that disastrous dinner . after some time away , the two ks and i decided to return to aksum for dinner last night . the dinner last night was very enjoyable . night and day . we ordered the hummus , which is a favorite . instead we were given the mediterranean platter with hummus , tzaziki and lentels , compliments from the chef . we were charged only for the hummus . nice touch . the platter was delicious and filling . we ordered the fired calamari with arrabiata sauce next . this was also tasty , although some of the calamari pieces were saltier than others . we had to order the lamb shank and see if the last shank was an anomaly . it was . last night ' s lamb shank was tender , fell of the bone with a slight tough of the serving spoon . the fingerling taters and green beans were cooked well . we finished with two desserts , the bread pudding and the oreo beignet . both were very good . the oreo beignet was my favorite , a bit decadent with ice cream and fresh fruit . our server was pleasant , informative and competent . she also is a very interesting young lady . we enjoyed our dinner last night very much . 
i actually ate there about a year ago on a business trip . i was taken there by a co-worker who lives there . maybe it ' s because i ' m not from philly , but i don ' t get the appeal . the food is way overpriced for what you get . it was decent , but nothing to rave about . to be honest , most of it looks like it was made by a N year old , and thrown on the floor . the waiter acted indifferent to our presence . like he had better things to do . i really expected more . in hindsight , a trip to wendy ' s would have been more satisfying . i didn ' t originally post anything because i don ' t usually do internet reviews , but since they don ' t have any problem with publicly displaying their displeasure with customers , i felt compelled to share my experience . i give the restaurant N stars for being meh , not bad or good , but deduct N stars for their public attack on customers . i won ' t be going there in my next trip out there . 
great spot for lunch and desserts . the atmosphere is lovely and the food is even lovelier . all their sandwiches are great , the goulash is amazing here , the sausage salad is perfect and the vinegar dressing really makes it . what really wins my heart here is all their desserts . the best apple strudel is definitely here it ' s the perfect texture and just melts in your mouth . all their other tea cakes are amazing and their chocolate cakes are also great . you just can ' t go wrong with dessert here because everything is so delicious . the pastries here are perfect for take-out as well . 
we are always happy and full after a visit to rosa ' s . the food is outstanding and the chef is very creative with seasonal specials . even my picky kids love the bolognese sauce and appetizers . can ' t wait to go back ! 
this place is under new ownership - food is delicious - he makes the sauce fresh and the chicken is perfect every time i order . the salads are fresh-crisp . i ' ve been recommending to many people . they are open for breakfast on the weekends which is a nice place to go after a rough week of work ! good atmosphere and large menu which is why i go N-N week ! 
i don ' t always want halal but when i do it ' s Nrd Nth halal guys ! the line is long but worth it ! very inexpensive also and is a must try just ask for the mix ! 
i probably won ' t go back to a single pebble . - it took nearly an hour to get our food . a half-hour after we ordered , the waitress said they mixed up our order so everything was going to be delayed . she brought us some complimentary napa cabbage salad to hold us over . - the environment was ridiculously loud . i ' m not sure if it was just a few loud tables causing the noise or the entire place , but it was not a pleasant ambiance . - food was good but definitely not " must have " as some would lead you to believe . - our beverages were kept full throughout the entire N hour meal . - by the time everything finally showed up , we were pretty full from the cabbage and multiple glasses of water we drank before anything arrived . for this reason only , lots of leftovers were packaged up . - the markup on beverages was way above the local average . N . N for a local can of beer . . . no joke . 
i went with a group of N girls , and the waiter gave us a very hard time about ordering N appetizers salads for N people on our party instead of entrees . though the food was good , the experience with the waiter created an unpleasant atmosphere . 
we came on labor day weekend so luckily for us , we had a table outside without waiting . it was a slower day at the restaurant . what did we have that was so good ? the squid ink risotto , the creamy corn pizza and the clam pizza . excellent and refined quality . nothing needed to be added . our waitress was superb . we finished every single bite . all N of us would come back again . 
waitstaff - phenomenal food - get ready to overeat everything ! 
we ate here over labor day weekend for the restaurant ' s soft opening . the place is unbelievable . from the decor to the service to the food ( the food ! ) to the drinks , the team of cooknsolo has killed it once again . go , eat everything , you won ' t be disappointed - the food is delicious and inventive , unlike anything this city ( or any city ) has ever seen . book now , i predict this place will be mobbed every night from now until forever . 
yep . best deli sandwich i ' ve had in downtown new haven . sure it ' s a little price-y , but man is it worth it . and you can ' t beat their monday lunch deal--soup , sandwich , chips and a drink for N . they just got themselves a loyal customer . space is small , so best to take food to go . 
what else can i say ? the rest of the reviews say everything ! yum yum yum ! okay i will get to the point . shishito peppers yum yum all appetizers yum yum ramen ( stick to the traditional and stick to red meat-chicken in my opinion wasn ' t that great ) also the spicy version is great ( i am an indian and my tolerance is high but it ' s not all that spicy ) overall , a place if you go once , you will crave repeatedly ! 
wow . the rumors are true . roberta ' s is making some of new york best pizza ! the crust is amazing - tangy , charred , and crisp . it stands up to the wonderful topping offerings very well . no soggy crust here ! the asparagus with bottarga and poached egg was refreshing , simple , and unique . the cheese plate was also amazing because you not only get to sample a variety of flavors , you get a huge hunk of roberta ' s amazing fresh bread to go with it ! going to brunch was such a treat . 
i ' m giving this place N . N stars based on what i would have paid for my meal here , and not what i actually paid ( N pp through a special event dinner - N or N stars for that pricing ) . the dinner rolls are as soft , fluffy , and delicious as everyone says . we were served family-style , and had the lola rosa ( good , but the four thin slices of raw tuna were meager at best ) , house charcuterie ( various salamis with mustard and bread , pretty good ) , and the chilled heirloom baby beets ( very tasty ) for the first course . for the second , there was the peekytoe crab gratin and the colorado lamb spareribs which were both delicious , and the wood oven flatbread which was fine but nothing special . next came marvesta prawns and texas wild boar , both very good , and the heirloom potato cassoulet , which i could have done without . for dessert we had a blood orange gelato-type scoop with a cr me fraiche wedge that tasted like super light and fluffy cheesecake . most of the food was good , but nothing especially stood out or was truly inspired , especially compared to dishes at some of jose ' s other restaurants . for N all this was a steal , but i could definitely see how the portions could be much too small for the prices they normally charge , as seems to be the common complaint here . still , the food is fresh and well-prepared , and is worth a try if you have money to burn . service is a little slow , though . as a side note , there is a room for private parties in the back , and i can easily see this being a great place for a wedding rehearsal dinner or some other special occasion . 
its a shame when the food is amazing , but there service is horrendous . when the hostess passed us up twice for having a party of . N , and four people walk ( one with reservation and another was a walk in ) and we are standing in front of a table for four that wasn ' t reserved , that is insulting . even better is when our waiter is outside typing away on his phone ( apparently our order is not important ) . if you can stomach rude behavior from the staff , the food is amazing . 
this place is really on the upswing . as a restaurant the food is absolutlely scrumptious . i ' m not used to thick and heavy italian food , but i had the homemade gnocchi here and i stunned the waitress by eating it all . the gnocchi itself was very tasty , but the sauce is what made it stand out and kept me shoveling it into my pie-hole like i was never going to eat again . they have a great deal for dinners , where two people get appetizer , two entrees , dessert and a bottle of wine . the bar has great deals too ! i can ' t remember the day , but there are N pint nights , and in general it has an awesome vibe to just come out and party with your girls . if you get the munchies after a night of drinking the pizzaria is always churning out pies too . can ' t get any better than that . 
jim ' s at Nth and south is way better . 
my cousins took me to this place when i was about N or N . now i am ready to go off to college . nevertheless , i still enjoy coming here with my mom for the famous soup dumplings . yes , the line might be long for most of the time , but i think your experience will be worth it . nothing compares to this restaurants ' famous dish and those dumplings are absolutely mouth watering . i always have to stop by when i am in the area . i highly recommend this restaurant . 
the wait time is usually pretty crazy , however it is a high volume establishment . it is a tad over priced and if you dont speak french you may have a difficult time understanding the menu . so i went with a burger and it was okay but not worth N , shake shacks would have been just as good for half the price ! 
wow ! great place , food is great and we barely like mexican food ! not fast food , its a restaurant ! perfect place to bring your girl also ! 
normally i don ' t just throw out five star reviews but this place earned it . my guy and i sat down for lunch on friday and were greeted by the kindest wait staff possibly ever . every single person who helped us was so friendly . i ordered the chicken sandwich with couscous and it was pretty much the perfect lunch . lots of flavor , tasted fresh . my guy cleaned his plate as well and both of us were flipping over how good the fries were . we had a few beers and chatted and they didn ' t rush us out which gets a gold star in my book . if i lived in the neighborhood i could imagine this being my regular spot . 
we came to new york on a family holiday trip . my husbands family are italians from upstate new york . we heard how fantastic it was and decided to try it . this is one of the best places i have ever eaten . . . . ever . i recommend every entree-we were with a huge party and i tried it all . don ' t miss the tiramisu or the ricotta cheesecake ! we will be back ! ! ! ! 
the food is amazing and the service is decent . it ' s a good restaurant overall but it gets really crowded at night . 
my wife and i tried it last week . we absolutely love indian food and were thrilled to try this new spot - especially after seeing the good reviews the secaucus restaurant gets . we tried the butter chicken , lamb vindaloo , chicken N appetizer , and garlic naan . chicken N - it was fine i guess . i wouldn ' t order it again but i wasn ' t turned off . butter chicken - bizarrely sweet ( there is no ingredient in butter chicken that should make it sweet , did they add pure sugar ? ) . we couldn ' t finish it , it was not good . huge disappointment . lamb vindaloo - not as bad as the butter chicken , but not good . sauce was thin and watery in parts , and bland throughout . we ordered it extra spicy . it was not spicy at all . garlic naan was fine , no problems there . i can ' t comment on anything else from the menu - but it ' s worth noting that if your butter chicken and vindaloo aren ' t good . . . i ' m not convinced anything else will be much better . we didn ' t save our leftovers . i have never not saved indian food leftovers before ! we won ' t be returning . luckily there are several better indian options in montclair and other nearby towns . it ' s not fun writing negative reviews , and we ' re bummed this place didn ' t work out . oh well ( 
i love this place . its authentic cuban food and fairly priced . 
returned , and we were lulled into a stunned , grateful silence . the food . tip whatever specials the waitress offers you - trust them . my friend explained that when you go french , you go hard . bring on the butter , the wine sauce , the savory . savor we did . - special N lobster spaghetti , with vanilla butter ? ! and garlic sauce . sooo well balanced . taste buds absorbed it . light , but creamy . will return on dates for that dish alone , if i can catch it . - special N of course i had the much heavier dish . tender veal with sliced mushrooms in a creamy , rich white wine sauce . mashed potatoes topped with spinach . simple enough . silence when it set in front of me . eyes closed at first bite . am i being dramatic ? no . so good . ugh . i can ' t use the word " full " to describe how i feel . i am . . . saturated . finally despite being ( saturated ) and half-asleep from the butter coma , dessert was ordered . instant decision to go with the house-made lavender creme-brulee . yeah , housemade lavender creme brulee . i swear to god it is like colors shifting across your palette . i highly recommend this dessert to anyone with heightened taste buds , you can literally feel the flavors changing . - extra try the grog . a piping bowl of hot water , honey , lemon juice , and rum . officially in love with this place . 
it ' s hilarious how people think this place is good ! i always give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt thinking that my first visit they could have been having an off day ? which is why i went back for a second chance . . . . just for starters , the service is rude and overwhelming ! when you walk in there about N people behind one counter ? you ask for a booth and they say they are reserved . once you get seated , a server asks if you ' re ready to order . . . . . really ? i just sat down- Npm . then you begin to wonder if the reserved booths are real since the whole time i ' m there , over an hour , they ' ve been empty . when you ask if the reservation was cancelled the rude manager tells you that people are coming and they are only for four to a booth , never two . whwn i sat down , there were N booths with parties of two ? then i see her seat another party of two in a booth and i ask , what about them , she replies , oh there party is on there way . their remaining party never showed . meean while the N and N reserved booths had long expired since it was now N . liers ! i then wondered why the ac was blasting down on me when it was cool outside . . . . . . maybe to keep the sushi fresh ? after being harassed by every single waitress every N minutes , we were pressured into giving our order . by then we were completely fed up so we left after being there almost an hour and feeling like i had been lied to and harassed . the cold and rude service , the cold sushi fridge atmosphere and fake reservations really put me over the edge . never again will they see my hard earned money ! want a great all around sushi experience , go to yuki hana , madison , nj and ask for andy . . . . tell him ozzie sent you ! ) 
i came to this place because i was in the area and it had pretty good reviews . as soon as i entered , i wasn ' t sure if i was in the right place . i thought i invaded someone ' s house . the reviewers were accurate regarding the " different " set up but i wasn ' t expecting what i saw . the place was a bit closed in and cluttered for my taste . it was like the combination of a bed breakfast , a library , and a day care center . not in modern day times through . if you bring a small kid they would be entertained because there are loads of books around . everything just didn ' t seem to go together . i ordered the basics eggs , bacon , and their popular biscuits and gravy . everything was average . not one item stood out as tasty , seasoned , or extremely fresh . it was something to eat if you were starving-and i was . i was pretty disappointed , and going forward i will not try out breakfast foods based on yelp reviews . my taste palettes are way more complex than the average person . i need more than a bland meal . just because it ' s not disgusting- doesn ' t make it good either . sorry , i can ' t try this again . 
the pit . . . an unfortunate name really , and unfortunately , even though the food is not that bad , it lacks finesse . they close really early ( like all other restaurants in bloomfield , i guess they don ' t like money ) , and the menu although pretty well rounded , should have better options for sides the ones they offer really seem like an afterthought- the inclusion of fries with everything is met with disbelief when you ask for veggies and salad , or matched with rice and beans ( beans- typical portuguese kinda flavorless , rice not bad at all ) . its menu consists of good meats prepared very well , but the really nice guy owner doesn ' t offer a good sauce to finish them off with . i do realize that portuguese bbq doesn ' t usually come with sauces , but the plastic packets of lousy cheap bbq sauce just really doesn ' t cut it . ive been to portuguese churrascarias before , and the meats were seasoned really deliciously well . while the chicken has really good flavor and what seems to be a garlic lemon basting , the ribs seem to be bland from lack of sauce but juicy- makes you want to reach for those hideous packets if you dont have some better quality bbq sauce in your fridge- but isnt that the point of ordering in , that the restaurant would have that covered ? also- for the longest time , they didnt have vegetables at all , and i suggested to him that he offer some , and eventually started serving platters with this really bland out of a frozen bag mix that really lacked any flavor at all . how hard is it to saute your own ? i can make a kick ass veg mix with three or four cheap veggies that will knock your socks off- if you go through all the trouble to run an open fire rotisserie with quality meats , why fudge the rest ? one highlight is , the flan- its truly fantastic stuff and reasonably priced like the menu , some of the best ive had besides this co-workers home made stuff that was a game changer for me . so seriously- nice guy owner dude . . . ive been telling you that it really sucks you close at N for years , and the few things it would take to make your meals fantastic are really easy to accomplish , so why not dive in to your portuguese culinary history , and start researching good marinades , sauces and sides , and make up a few varieties of vegetables . these days people want low carb options , and your meats fall right in to the category that those of us who watch that sort of thing look for , so give us options , and ones that dont taste like wet cardboard . i know you can do it , seriously . 
smallest tacos in the world . go somewhere else . 
i really wanted to like this place . i have no idea how this place got one star michelin . i have been here N times and each time only verifies what i feel is ok food with nice atmosphere . 
i figured it was finally time for me to accept the fact that i ' ve moved over the bridge to brooklyn and start checking out restaurants in my new neighborhood instead of incessantly trekking to manhattan . what can i say , i ' m terrible at change . fortunately , i could not have picked a better place to make my brooklyn restaurant scene debut . the roommate and i checked it out for dine-in brooklyn week , and though it was packed , we were seated immediately with a reservation at a cute little table tucked away in a cozy corner . the small dining room opens up into a larger covered patio area , and is punctuated by skinny bookcases stacked with old-looking volumes on wine . if a ) my roommate wasn ' t in a serious relationship and b ) we weren ' t both straight , it would have been the perfect setting for a date . we " splurged " on the wine pairings - N - which gets you three , N N full glasses of wine to complement your appetizer , entree , and dessert . it turned out to be a solid decision and worth the extra dough , even if the final wine selections - a sherry for me and a port for her - only served to remind us the dessert wine is gross . the waitress explained each wine upon pouring and was kind enough to write down the name and vintage of the beaujolais we both really enjoyed . food was delicious , the fried goat cheese appetizer with prosciutto and mandarin orange was unexpectedly stellar . looking forward to checking out their famed brunch menu soon . 
my favorite restaurant in the city . large portions of delicious food at reasonable prices - is that actually possible in nyc ? it is here . the staff is friendly and the service excellent . i ' ve even been given free drinks on multiple occasions ( granted i am a regular here . ) my german father said the cooking reminds him of his grandmother ' s i now take him here every single time he ' s in town . i can ' t recommend this place highly enough . 
i ' ve had lunch several times at bleu sushi and it has always been very good . orders are quickly filled and available on grub hub which is convenient . the rolls , shrimp vegetable tempura and salmon teriyaki have all been great . 
decided to eat here on a sunday evening after driving around for an hour trying to park for the googa mooga festival . unfortunately , we never made it to googa mooga , but fortunately , we made it to cafe steinhof ! we were very pleased with the atmosphere and the food ! i ordered the brook trout which was really good ! my boyfriend ordered the seafood stew-he said it was great ! for sides , we orderd kielbasa ( wow-delicious ) , and the spaetzle . it was good , but the price for the size we got was a bit ridiculous ! the only down fall we ran into was one waitress and one bartender for the night and it was packed in there ! i ' m glad we got to experience this and you should to ! 
this place is pretty decent . their xlb is pretty juicy . however , when comparing this to ding tai fung it just doesn ' t compare . i ' m not that big of a fan of dtf but i do like the skin of dtf ' s dumplings . here it ' s kind of just big saggy and juicy . it ' s tasty but probably not worth waiting in line for . luckily when i went it was pretty empty and got seated right away . i also got the rice cake noodle soup which was actually pretty good . the restaurant is small so we sat next to another couple really close . i wasn ' t too sure what the service charge was on the bill . i asked the waiter if that ' s tip and he said yes . hopefully that ' s really what he means because i didn ' t leave anything else . lol
easily my new favorite bar in bushwick . avoid the art douchery of tandem , the tropical vomit spewage of bossa nova civic club . get some well thought-out cocktails , or no frills drinks in a cozy setting , and enjoy ridiculously delicious cajun food while you do it . seriously . i had the shrimp sliders w tarragon . . outrageous . and you can never go wrong with the boudin balls . tchoup shop knows where it ' s at . 
this place was crazy inside with trippy murals . food was tasty and service was outstanding- they offered us complimentary shots and desserts . can ' t argue with that . great place . 
loved this place . sat outside with a group of N and the atmosphere was equal parts relaxing and invigorating . we shared a cheese plate , for which our waiter was very helpful in customizing something to meet the group ' s different tastes . the calamari appetizer was fantastic , especially the strips of pickled tomatoes . i ordered the bass , perfect portion size and great taste . i ' m usually not a fish person , but i wanted a change of pace , and it was well worth it . as an added bonus , the bar inside had a selection of locally brewed beers which i really wanted to try while i was in philly for business . 
fantastic neighborhood coffee and breakfast brunch spot ! delicious omelettes and egg dishes ( my favorite is the roasted tomato goat cheese omelette - listed as egg white omelette but i get it with real eggs ) . also fantastic pastries and baked goods . excellent service , beautiful space and reasonable prices . what ' s not to love ? ! 
prices are fair , food is yummy , cozy ambiance . i love thai food and i was definitely not disappointed , i defaulted with dumplings and pad thai ( as padthai is the general marker for thai restaurants ) - my favorite part was actually the mango and sticky rice , mango was fresh and sweet , the sticky rice contrasted nicely . 
this is real chinese food , especially if you stay away from the " foreign devils dishes . " i ' m not sure , but i believe the chef is the owner . you ' ll often see him sitting out front when things are quiet , sometimes teaching his kids to read or otherwise being a good family man . when he steps behind the stove , he becomes a wizard . the restaurant isn ' t much to look at-- the theater next door went bankrupt and looks like it was bombed-out , so you might be unsure if chengdu N is even open any more . we were there last night , and i was nervous the recession might ' ve killed it , but it endures thank goodness . it ' s very typical of restaurants in china , including a decidedly casual wait staff . dishes come out as they ' re finished , not in any particular order , and the staff hardly changes over time , unheard-of with most american chinese restaurants . comments here about the poor service baffle me . i guess i ' m used to a casual demeanor from wait staffs in china . now , about the food . when this place opened up , it was very authentic with a large selection of authentic spicy dishes . over time , they have added the " usual suspects " of lemon or general tso ' s chicken , lo mein and hot sour soup because they ' re what americans want , and turning away business is commercial death . the good news is these additions are grouped under the " classic " banner . the menu is crowded with choices , yet if you look around or ask , you ' ll get a revelation of what the chinese really eat . the szechuan sichuan specialties on the menu are where the chef ' s genius shines through . if you can ' t eat anything spicy , then you probably should go somewhere else don ' t ask picasso to paint-by-numbers . to start with , politely decline the deep-fried noodles and orange " duck sauce " the waitress brings obligatorily to western diners , and ask for peanuts instead . it will buy you some street cred with the staff . appetizers aren ' t something we usually eat a lot of , preferring to save our appetites for the main dishes , but the wontons in hot oil are delicious , if quite spicy . the cold dan-dan noodles aren ' t really noodles as we know them , but strips of rice dough with a decidedly gelatinous texture not to my particular taste , yet very authentic . texture is important to the chinese my friend , ken hom the food writer , told me jello sells out in hong kong . the chinese base their eating around meat dishes , fish , veggies and soup , with meat decidedly less-frequent and in smaller quantities than the groaning platters served in restaurants here catering to american preferences . so make sure you focus on the vegetables , consider a soup ( chinese diners often have more than one at a banquet ) , and certainly something seafood . sichuan may be a land-locked province , but that hasn ' t prevented the cuisine there from embracing shellfish , dried fish ( abalone , for example , a hong kong influence ) , etc . veggies first when in season , ask for " kong shin tsai , " often called " water spinach " or other names in english . it ' s a leafy green vegetable with a hollow stem ( the name means " empty hearted veggie " ) that is simply stir-fried in oil and spices . the chinese brocoli is also very good and is usually in season ( not to be confused with western brocoli dishes ) . the julienned potatoes and green peppers are wonderful ( green as in green chilis , but very mild-tasting ) . the saut ed bean thread w . green vegetable is excellent , and the ma-po tofu is meaty , oily and very much traditional home cooking . tofu doesn ' t have much flavor on its own , so it picks up the chillis and stir-fried pork tastes . soups are more-limited , probably because americans don ' t usually eat soup ( other than the " classic " wonton variety ) when dining chinese . i like the pork pickled cabbage . in colder months , order one of the caseroles or hot pots . i hesitate to recommend one in particular , since traditionally chinese chefs work from what ' s fresh and in-season , but the dry panned beef ( or lamb ) w . chili is good . don ' t be fooled by the " dry " qualifier , this is a kind of spicy stew . for the committed carnivors , the pork chops with salt are a guilty pleasure for me ( called " cispy spareribs w . salt pepper " on the menu ) . the szechuan style shredded beef or pork are very tasty . kung pao chicken w . peanuts isn ' t a revelation , but solid and something most americans are familiar with . the trick here is to ask what ' s fresh , ask for guidance , and tell them you don ' t want western-style fare ( if you can handle the phonetics , tell them you want " dow dee duh zhong gwo fan " which means " authentic chinese food " ) . 
best place in flatbush . hands down . 
eastwick is my favorite place to eat . i have been here multiple times and they never disappoint . the service and the atmosphere is really good . every time i walk in i am greeted with a smile and feel very welcomed . they have a great bar with a nice beer selection . i highly recommend the moroccan soup , mac and cheese ( which is better than dumonts ) , the burgers are phenomenal and for dessert the chocolate mousse is a must . if anyones looking for a freshly prepared meal with gourmet taste this is the spot . 
my girlfriend and i decided to check out the place after heard good things about this place . we ordered N crepes in total lychee valentine , crepe dog and azuki green tea . i would recommend the azuki since the rest aren ' t really impress me at all . the crepes somehow come different in standards , the azuki green tea that is made by the asian lady who assumed to be an owner impressed us right away . on the other hand , the other two crepes that made by the employees come out much smaller in size as well as the crepes weren ' t cook well at all . overall , it is a good place if you have a chance to visit soho and want to grab something while hanging around . ps it would be better if they could train the employee to make the crepe at the same standards . 
the roasted vegetables will change your life . . . . . in a good way ! not like those dastardly grilled vegetables i had at another place . . . . practically ruined my life . seriously , get their grilled veggies over rice . delicious . 
the food was fresh and excellent tasting . we had friendly , courteous servers . i would highly recommend the pork shank special . the portions were generous . we did not feel rushed at all . our whole party ( my daughter and mom ) thoroughly enjoyed the meal . 
if you ' re not from the east coast ( as i am not ) this cheesesteak may surprise you , since you ' ve probably never had a " real " cheesesteak . i ' ve been here N times now , so know what to expect long lines any time of day , limited seating , and no containers for ketchup for the fries . you order and pay for your steak at one window ( get it " wit onions " ) and get your fries and drink at the next window . it ' s just fun to bring new people here just so they can say they ate here . parking can be a bit of a chore , but that ' s just philly . 
seriously , no one in bayonne should ever order from fontana ' s ever again . they messed up my order and i ' ve been waiting over N minutes for them to come and fix it . when i called to complain the owner answers the phone and tells me she has no driver , that i need to just wait until they get around to bringing the order back , and hung up on me . i called back to say i don ' t even want the food i just want a refund , and she hung up again . never again . ever . 
not worth all the hype ! ! ! ! ! ! okay so where do i begin . well my buddy nick told me about this amazing place called " potatopia " . so last week i tried it out . when i got in there , it looked like a nice place . the food smelled amazing . when i got the register a short women took my order . not the most politest girl but ehh . she convinced me to get a " smash hit " so i said hey why not if it ' s the best seller . now here ' s when every thing goes down south . she told me it would only take N-N minuets tops . it took me N minutes to get it . - . - i told them no cilantro and they added cilantro - . - " . this " awesome potatopia " my friend told me about was not how he explained it . the " great " customer service i heard so much about wasn ' t there and i didn ' t even enjoy my food . not worth N - . - . for all that i can cook a potato in my own home . 
our family including my brother ' s are big fan of edison mithaas . so we were literally waiting for this location to open . i should say the first couple of times we tries as soon as they opened was either bad or not so fresh . it was very obvious that food was not made fresh here . we were really disappointed and this kind of left a bad taste to back to edison . last night accidentally we picked up some chaat and other stuff for dinner for N and every single item was fantastic . we were greatly surprised to taste the real edison mithaas flavor . tonight i went back again with my friend had dinner thali . wow same good quality . i strongly feel their taste , quality and quantity has improved a lot . i just hope they keep up with this quality . yes i agree with one of the review , some staff are very pleasant n friendly and some don ' t even make an eye contact or wish . there one person who is the same as always - welcoming , enquiring , asking customers about the food . and he takes the criticism well and tries to always fix the issue . but as long as i get good food and decent service i definitely would go back at least once a week . 
one of the best nepalese food restaurant in new york city , i have tried . great food and reasonably good service . recommend to check this place out , you may not regret ! 
i would get city pizza delivered to me at university of hartford at least once a week and they always had a great deal with free delivery though i always gave them an extra big tip . the cheese pizza was a bit on the greasier side but so good and the crust was nice and crisp . i like how they had like circles of sauce dripped on top of the cheese . i also got the calzone here though i prefer sisson ave ' s to theirs . absolutely recommended to college students and people in the area . i ' ve only drove by city pizza and never gone inside . they have some seating but it doesn ' t look like that much fun to sit and eat there so have their excellent delivery people bring the pie to your door ! 
one of those sort of ok type places where the food is , well ok and the waitstaff can range from pleasant to absolute bitches . we ' ve had a couple of real interesting servers who sure weren ' t happy about their jobs . entertaining in a warped kind of way . not sure why i keep going back though . convenience maybe ? 
lots of choices for brunch or lunch during the day . . . plus eat inside or out ! ! 
this place was good . . . now it ' s terrible . the food quality is horrible . it is old and the farthest thing from fresh possible . do not go here and wait in line based on the hype . . . it is not worth it ! my girlfriend and i also got sick after eating here . . . watch out ! 
great place to order from for pizza , pasta , and stuff like that . the price is right , portions are good , and quality is good . though it has an eat in , it is not a place that i would generally take my family to eat at . it ' s best to take out or order delivery . 
delicious burgers , delicious duck fat fries and yummy drinks . a little on the pricey side for essentially pub fare , but if you ' re looking for an upscale burger joint with a nice atmosphere this is your place . space is a bit limited on the inside so either make a reservation or come early . 
love love love the food ! kale salad is outstanding . omelete is amazing . coffee is good , bloody mary is drinkable . service is not my favorite but not terrible . 
my favorite italian restaurant in the city , and my favorite byob in the city . i have been to eatalia numerous times , and the food has never been less than phenomenal . the menu always has it ' s staples , but the seasonal additions are always incredible . the service is great , the staff is great . . . . . i have , will , and do recommend this place ! 
i have been coming here for the past N years and every time i go there is constantly new specials and new updates and ideas . the manger is a very nice guy and is N of the time available at the pub . every time we go there he comes to our table and shakes our hands , the same that he does to all the patrons there . they changed their menu N months ago and they have very good appetizer selection along with new sandwiches and wraps . thee pub is best know for its best thin crust pizza in town and the buffalo wings . now they have tuesday night special which they called " buffalo night out " , all buffalo items is N and N cent wings along with beer specials if you have an orange tshirt on . all their employees are dressed up in orange tshirts and sneakers . every time we go their we always have a good service . it is a very friendly bar , everyone knows each other . it has a better atmosphere now than when we started coming here . overall it is a good place to come and hang out and have a cold beer and some good food . 
great low key atmosphere , and delicious salads and pizza ! a must go for those artisanal eaters ! 
it would be hard to beat the pancakes here ! ! 
once upon a time i included this halal cart in a little thing i called the holy trinity ( of food ) yes , i was in love . halal was my everything , i would crave it all the time ! fast forward several years - i still love it , it ' s still delicious but i don ' t crave it anymore . every now and then i ' ll get a real hankering for it and go all the way there , wait on line for N mins and nommmmmm like a starved animal . i think i just ate so much of it that i ' m all halaled out ! side note - spicy hot sauce . do not mess around with it . 
i should probably preface this review by saying that the couple who decided to bring their baby to a nice restaurant for dinner at N N on a saturday night probably had something to do with my overall negative experience . we have four kids ourselves , so when we get a chance to go out , we don ' t want to sit next to a fussy and crying baby for an hour . besides the crying baby , our experience wasn ' t ideal . we arrived at N N . the hostess asked us if we had a reservation . we said no ( the place was still N N empty ) , and she gave us a look like we had committed a crime . after a deep sigh , she seated us next to the back door . awesome . maybe you should be on open table if you want people to make reservations ? our waitress tried to sell us on a bourbon tasting , but instead we ordered a round of cocktails . the lemon plum was a bit too bitter for me , but my husband ' s drink was fantastic . i cannot remember the name , and it ' s not listed on their website , but it had coconut , mint , and cucumber , i would have liked one myself ! per our server ' s suggestion , we started with the cesar salad . yuck . i appreciate an original take on a favorite , but this was just too much . it tasted more like cole slaw . and btw , if you ' re going to desecrate a cesar salad with tomatoes , they should be fresh and ripe . i was hankering for scallops , so i ordered the scallops appetizer for dinner . hubby had the rib eye . the scallops were supposed to be pan seared . first off , the scallops were three of the smallest ones i ' ve ever seen , like the size of a dime . literally . either they weren ' t properly seared or were done so in a dirty pan . yuck . by this time , i would have liked another beverage , but where is my server ? my husband ' s steak was cooked just the way he asked for it . the accompaniments weren ' t so great . the potatoes were not quite done and the broccoli rabe was just too bitter . the aforementioned crying kid at the next table was really kicking it up now , so we didn ' t even bother staying for dessert . nothing looked exceptionally interesting to me anyway . i had to ask to get my water refilled twice and our server didn ' t come back to see how our meals were until we were done . we never did get our bread . the decor is lovely , but i found the tv in the bar to be distracting , and it didn ' t really seem to fit in with the overall image of the place . i really wanted to like this place . i love that the chef is an ex-marine . in addition to being an ardent supporter of veterans , my dad was in the marine corps for N years . semper fi ! i will probably return in the summer to take advantage of the lovely outside seating and try one of the cocktails my husband , had but not sure about going back for another meal . 
mirabelles made my wedding cake N years ago and it was sublime . but . . . i ordered a cake for my inlaw ' s N wedding anniversary last week and it was sadly very disappointing . it looked pretty from the outside , but when we cut into it there was more buttercream frosting on the cake than cake itself . it was like eating sweet butter , and sure it sounds great , but it ' s really not . in an attempt to salvage the moment , we ate the cake between the layers of frosting and the frosting stood up like beeswax . wish i had take a picture of it to post . on the other hand i had great wait service while i was picking up the cake . friendly waitress and support staff . 
i went to dinner with very high expectations because i could never get a reservation here . . . first , the decor is very pretty . we were seated at the second floor , where the wine room is located . the food was great . we shared some appetizer and i ordered a pasta , which was great . came with a friend who loves to dine and he sounded surprised as in how good this place was . he even recommended it to a friend afterwards . 
great location , wonderful hot sizzler and salad bar , service is adequate , a little crowded but very clean environment , sizzlz holds the best value for your buck . i spend about N . N for a full course meal w salad bar and i leave for home feeling stuffed ! 
the staff was friendly and service good and the food was delicious ! the rotisserie chicken was very good ! you can order a quarter or N N chicken . we also tried the fish civiche which was great ! one of the best that i have had . the restaurant is small and the noise level high during my lunch . i will definitely go back and try more things but the ceviche and chicken will be a regular choice . 
the best italian food i have had to date , real authentic . very small and crowded , but well worth it . must have the hot roast beef with free mozz . 
stumbled upon this restaurant on my way to home , and i must say it was the best decision . delicious food , awesome service , clean place - a " rare " combo these days , especially if you visit an indian restaurant . a server was too nice to explain each and every dish and recommended veg kati roll and vada pao on my first visit . both the items were so tasty and fresh and that made me visit this place on a regular basis . a must visit place for indian fast food lovers . 
this place is definitely a nice , solid addition to the lackluster choices on restaurant row . hopefully they also stay in business a whole lot longer than a bunch of places that lasted barely a year or two on this tourist trap street . neo-latin food - that ' s what this place is all about . i had the argentinian platter which featured lots of freakin ' meat with chimichurri sauce . steak , short rib , port chop , chicken , chorizo , etc etc . bottom line - it was a freakin ' ton of meat . overall i was very pleased . it wasn ' t the most amazing i ever had , it it was still pretty decent . some of the meat lacked flavor but the sauce more than made up for it . my lady ordered the signature fish ribs , which were actually quite tasty and made for great eye candy . just watch the huge bones . otherwise you will definitely dig this dish . the dessert was solid . how can you fuck up tres leches ? ( well , some places can ) . their version of it was sweet but also refined . it ' s definitely a dessert worth gobbling up . just note the price here are on the higher side , but for a pre post theater dinner , it is a fab option . it also has a nice cozy ambiance and the staff is very friendly . all in all worth your time if you happen to be in the area for a show or just for date night . 
i found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try on a friday night with my friends . i made a reservation , which was a smart decision because the place was crowded and i think there was a waiting time when we got there . service was very good and food was delicious . thumbs up for the cheeseteak egrolls ! we tried different meats and everything had a very nice and authentic bbq flavor to it . i was surprised because i am used to bbq places being less formal and this place is nice and the food is still amazing . i loved the sangria as well . will definitely go back ! 
really loved it . food was great , boyb was nice , waitress was charming , and the overall atmosphere was intimate and pleasant . highly recommend as a date spot or for a nice dinner with a friend . 
ok steak , but on the night that my husband and i went , they really didn ' t have any vegetable sides ! 
yummy in my tummy ! ! amazing burger great bottle of wine too ! this restaurant is bomb digs for a number of reasons . just go ! cheer local farm fresh boo i don ' t have one
i ' m obsessed , this place just has great food and atmosphere . it is a place to be and been seen , as well as people watch in rittenhouse square . 
perfect for special occasion ( read ) . candle-lit , chic black chairs and thick oak tables , well-dressed waiters and diners make for an intimate ambiance and upscale experience . the focus here is tapas and wines ( obvi ) , but feasts include a whole pig roast , lobster paella , and special occasion pre fixes . i recommend splitting a pitcher of the white sangria , and adorning it with pulpo , mussels , and an ensalada verde ( as large as an upside-down cereal bowl ) . it ' s garces , so good cheeses and meats as well . if you are into that . 
i liked it there alot . i think i ate too much . the margaraitas were good . the staff was fun and frienly . the ambience is decent . ithere arent that many mexican restaurants that you can dine at downtown so this place was good
i like this place just because everything is fresh and this is really clean restaurant ! a little funny crew works in there that makes me smile every time . food is really good and sushi chef mike makes the best rolls around . i wonder why is this place always so slow . good work guys , keep it up ! 
easily the best brisket i ' ve ever had . i was surprisingly shocked at how good the collard greens ( made with no ham and just butter ) were . the main man came over in his fake mustache to ask how everything was and then explained they " confit-ted the hell out of some garlc " to make them that good . the small ribs were also the best i ' ve eaten . honestly i can ' t tell you if they were the beef or pork ( i ' m guessing pork ) that i ended up getting , but i do know that i dislike pork ribs generally , so if he managed to make me a convert that is a huge accomplishment . i got there about N N for my pre-order and we were the first ones in the restaurant , no wait , no fuss , just friendly service and delicious food . by N N there was a decent line and four to five tables full . get there early ! side note two friends bailed on me last minute so my pre-ordered N . Nlbs meat ended up being way too much for me and my vegan girlfriend to eat . i doggie-bagged and fed my parents and sister . they all unanimously declared it was bar-none the best they ' ve had too . that speaks volumes as we come from a strong brisket family ( although typically roasted in the oven , not smoked ) . i ' m kicking myself for not trying the other sides , but i guess i ' ll just have to go back for my remaining pounds . 
excellent restaurant , great food and amazing ambiance ! will go back ! 
recently i go to bedford-stuyvesant often . peaches hothouse is my daily spot now . my favorite is jerk chicken , but i would try more items . in addition , staffs are all friendly and kind ! 
eek is the only way to describe the servers and the food . 
N stars because their tacos are the best out of the new mexican joints that have opened up in the past year . however . . . . that isn ' t saying that much . corn tortillas were good - didn ' t fall apart , tasty and a little chewy . wish the tacos were all a little cheaper , but i guess that ' s what you get when you ' re eating local meat and vegs . the meat was tender and juicy . the sweet potato taco , " el camote " , was very good with the crunch of the pepitas . but the sauces need some kick . for the love of god burlington please give me some spice . even the house-made hot sauces were not very spicy ! but . . . . i ' ll go back and ask them to make the tacos spicy and see what happens . . . . 
i was given the task of quickly finding an italian restaurant in the city for N of us . oh yes-and it must have wonderful food and service . no pressure-i just went to yelp and scanned the category . i came up with uva . although it has existed for N years , i had never heard of it . well-i looked like a hero ! they do not take reservations unless you are N or more and i am always uncomfortable with that . they told me about a N minute wait for N people at N N on a saturday night . my wife and i just assumed we would wait double that time and met our friends at the bar . this place is loud and a bit close but it is fun . there are N or N small tables near the bar and they do serve dinner there but good luck trying to get those seats on saturday night ! their wine list is extensive and has a choice for almost every palate . nice beer selection as well . we waited almost exactly N minutes and were seated in a wonderful table for N . the hostess even took our drinks from us and walked them over to our table . every staff member seemed happy and eager to please . our server was very professional and knew the details of every dish . she even gave us her opinion , when asked , about what to order . now to the meal-everything was fantastic . for the table we started with insalata caprese and bruschetta with mushrooms , arugula and parmigiano . all were tasty and fresh . for our mains we had-red snapper fish special , melanzane parmigiana ( layers of eggplant baked with tomato sauce , basil parmigiano ) . pappardelle al ragu di vitello ( pasta ribbons with ragout of veal montasio cheese ) and their signature dish-gnocchi ricotta . they were all so good and the gnocchi might be the best i have ever had ! for dessert we shared the chocolate mousse and the spongecake with nutella . both were mouth watering . next time we are out in the city and want italian-uva it is ! 
the square pie is really the only thing you ever need from this place . it ' s that great . the only other noteworthy item on the menu is the mussels . other than that , the rest of the menu is average , and the only reason it ' s not a five star review . 
delicious tacos ! i loved the sweet potato rajas and scrambled egg and beans . you can mix and match N tacos for N . can ' t beat it . 
i went there with a friend . we had bulgogi jun gol ( N . N ) . it was delicious and good for people who like meat . the small dishes are also very good . the only problem is that the restaurant is a little dark . but i really love the food there . i would like to try other dishes next time . 
i went to eulogy long years ago before i had learned to appreciate beer . i was on the most awkward date of my life and our third wheel ( in congruence with the fourth and fifth wheels ) suggested we stop at eulogy for dinner . being the horrific mishmash of budding foodie and goth chick , i thought it was just the place for me ! it wasn ' t until much later that i realized it really was . eulogy is a narrow place i ' d recommend against it if you ' re highly claustrophobic . it took me awhile to get used to knocking elbows with the people to either side of me . i have since learned the ways of personal space while at a crowded bar . there ' s a lot of wood in this place ( talking about the decor , not the patrons . ) and i love that you get the feeling of old-school ale house as soon as you walk in . eulogy is lit like a tavern , downstairs and upstairs ( yes , they have an upstairs for you folks who want a little intimacy . ) it really just sets the mood for a wonderful experience . the bartenders know their stuff . and so does the waitstaff . the first time i was there after turning twenty-one , i asked for a beer recommendation for someone who didn ' t like beer . the bartender i was dealing with asked me a few more questions about flavors i preferred ( sweet versus bitter , floral versus fruity ) and they offered me a sample of three different beers they had on tap that might suit my palate . and boy howdy , they were spot on with all . three . i was so shocked that someone who absolutely hated the taste of bottled pretzels ( what i affectionately called all the beer i ' ve ever sipped ) could find that same abhorrent beverage enjoyable . and , much to my shock and delight , they didn ' t charge me for a sample of the beers ! i don ' t know if i got lucky or what , but i thought that was fantastic . the food is belgian-inspired . lots of mussels and frites are served here and upon having them , i can understand why they ' re the most popular things on the menu . i haven ' t had better mussels anywhere else in philadelphia and i ' m a massive bivalve fiend . they have nine different mussel dishes , served with a crusty piece of bread for sopping up the broth they ' re cooked in ( and believe you me , you are going to want to freebase some of these broths . ) and if you ' re not really a fan of the shelled and the unctuous , then there ' s plenty of standard ( well , upscale standard ) bar fare for you to choose from . their menu pales in comparison to their beer list . front and back , double sided , eight-point-font - over N different beers to choose from and they list the type , the flavors contained therein , the country of origin , and the alcohol percent . it bears repeating these people know their stuff when it comes to beer . the place gets packed pretty quickly in the evenings , even faster if there ' s a game on . but the best part about eulogy is where it ' s located there ' s a hookah bar right around the corner from it that you can spend some time in while you wait for a table to open up . i always do it if the place is too crowded when i get there . the staff is always very hospitable , very friendly , and very accommodating . i ' ll be a fan for life . 
everything is amazing here ! ! ande the owner is a sweetheart n personal with his customers 
as a vegetarian i only get to enjoy the aromas of some of the city ' s best burger joints , here i get to enjoy my favorite veggie burger . the veggie cake sandwich , to be exact , is paired with a mound of sweet potato and regular french fries , it ' s glorious . always good beers on draft , and the entire staff strive to keep it a low-key fun bar . " don ' t stop believing " will get vetoed on the jukebox to keep the local popped collar crowd from taking over . always recommend this place , but seating is limited so expect to wait at peak times . lunch is my favorite time to go . 
tasty and service was ok . . . . . . 
took the entire family to zahav last night , november N , ( this included twins under N and one teen ) and was awesome . why ? the food was simply amazing . each and every dish was presented artfully and elegantly explained by the staff . oh , and they were very accommodating to the fact that if we ordered from the tayim , it would be for five , but not priced this way . as a family of five , we rarely see this , as hotels want us to get two rooms , etc . as a family with kids , the reviews told us that this was not a family friendly place . yet , the whole place was very welcoming of the kids and certainly did not mind having them around . now , if the kids were below say N-N , this probably is not the correct destination . we decided upon the tayim since this was going to be a adventure for our family . maybe next time we ' d do less , but this was a wonderful way to experience the entirety of the offerings . ( yes , pricey . we decided to drive home and forgo another night at a hotel motel in lieu of missing out . ) let ' s start with the laffa with hummus . devoured . the laffa was warm , flavorful and just the right texture . the hummus set a new bar for us , though . the texture and scent alone were worth the trip . the salatim were each wondrous . our family ' s favorites were the carrots ( cumin did the trick ) , the beets , and the eggplant . the tabouli was very good and the israeli salad , which we make at home , was extra special . the preparation of each of these made them a treat . they gave us N of the mezze to try and we tried most all of them . we ordered N of the cauliflower because we love this anyhow ( make this at times at home ) . our favorites were the kibbeh , the sable , the cauliflower , the haloumi ( sans walnuts ) , and the tuna . the sable , with the warm yolk inside of the toasted challah was like magic as the textures of the fish , runny yolk and toasty bread blended together . the cauliflower ( N of them ) did not last N minutes . the breading was flavorful and with that dill garlic mint accompaniment ! al ha ' esh was meguez , kofte , salmon , baby potatoes and the hanger steak . the kofte was simply amazing . each was delightful . the salmon ( sans so much spicy stew ) was eaten by the teen ( almost without sharing ) , until the couscous was spotted causing a squabble ! the baby potatoes with the ground lamb was simply divine . . . and the kofte was split into equal portions and left us all wanting more . oh , and we ate some of the desserts ( the chocolate went over very well , as did the halavah with strawberry ) but took some home for the drive . by the way , yes , parking is rough . i put the van outside the theater because i was lucky , but it did add to the price of the meal . for some , this might be a bit much , but for this type of quality , and the fact that parking is expensive in philadelphia , we dealt with this fact . so , overall , for a family depending on age it is just fine ( we went at Npm so probably more family oriented anyhow ) . quality outstanding . service welcoming . . . created a take home bag for us with what we could not eat . everyone explained what was served and answered any question ( even those from kids ) . an experience we won ' t soon forget . 
prices are constantly changing on a daily basis . horrible service . . rude ass workers . disgusting hot cold bar . . . using awful low quality ingredients . so expensive that it will make your fucking head spin ! open N N yeahhhhhh ! 
i did not expect this place to be what it was . thoroughly and pleasantly surprised . tops is an upper class diner with an extraordinary menu . i ate so much i nearly went into a food coma . try their bread pudding for dessert and you are sure to leave happy . 
i can not fathom why people would give this restaurant more than a star or two . i ' m starting to find yelp reviews unreliable . this was our first time ordering from peppino ' s and we will never eat their food again . overpriced for the quality . i gave one star for prompt delivery and one star because the food wasn ' t horrible . it was just bad . their bread is tasteless- this goes for their crust and garlic crisps . no flavor whatsoever . same with the plain pizza . we couldn ' t even finish a slice . the marina sauce is coated with a layer of oil and tastes burnt . the penne a ' la vodka was fine , but again , lacked flavor . the eggplant parm roll tasted old . if you want good pizza on Nth ave go to brooklyn central or la villa , which also has amazing pasta and appetizers . 
me and my boyfriend have been two times . we ' ve walked drove by here dozens of times but it wasn ' t until university city restaurant week that we went here ( it was one of the participating restaurants ) and we were curious . to be honest , i would have never gone in here judging by the outside . but i ' m glad i did . the food is very reasonably priced and also good the both times we have been there . the menu is also very friendly to vegetarians . please note that unless a place is designed to be some type of entertainment centered place , i generally don ' t rate based on anything else except food . other people seem to really like this place besides it ' s a sort of neighborhood joint but i didn ' t take this into account ( since i ' m new around here ) . 
pinto is good value for your money but definitely not an authentic thai experience . the restaurant is stylish while minimalist on the inside , clean , modern and unassuming - great for a little spot on christopher . after reading all of the positive reviews i was hopeful for a mouthwatering thai experience . what i got at pinto just wasn ' t . my friend and i started with the fried tofu stuffed with vegetables and topped with peanut sauce . it was entirely boring and bland . for dinner i choose the green curry with chicken , specifically because i wanted spicy and it said it was a hot chilly curry . nope , miss again . definitely not spicy , though it wasn ' t bad . just not a hot green chilly curry like i ordered . my friend had the pad thai with tofu . she was underwhelmed as well . it wasn ' t bad food , just not tasty thai food . i have to believe that somewhere in manhattan there ' s a thai spot similar to what you can find in queens . the quest goes on to find it . 
food is ok but overpriced . unlike all of garces ' other restaurants the hostess was actually nice . service was poor though as the waitress forgot one of our dishes and was very slow . will not return . 
i ' ve been meaning to try cafe lift for a while , and was happy to get the opportunity this past saturday . as far as brunch places go , a N-minute wait wasn ' t too bad , considering we were a party of N arriving right at N Nam on a saturday . the menu is pretty diverse , offering something for everyone - whether your tastes run savory , sweet , or more lunch-based . i ordered the huevos rancheros and really enjoyed my meal . it was extremely filling and the hot sauce ( possibly home made ? ) that accompanied it was out of this world . they don ' t overload you with a ton of breakfast potatoes , but it was a nice addition to the delicious tortillas beans egg combo . friendly service , interesting atmosphere , and great food . 
i searched for homemade bratwurst in all of western mass and finally hartford before coming up with this place . not sure what the hours are but they are open until N on tuesday . the service here was awesome . i went at an off peak time just to grab some brats . the woman behind the counter was helpful , polite , energetic and honest . i ended up with the brats and a couple other things , but got to try so much more at her insistence and she sent me on my way with almost as many samples to take home as i bought ! there are a lot of polish deli ' s in my area , but nothing compare to adolf ' s variety . products and service are great , i already can ' t wait to go back ! 
best pizza in ct ! this is the only place i ' ve had the mashed potatoes pizzas . it ' s a must ! ! ! 
beautifully decorated interior and patio . the restaurant was empty at N noon on a friday , when N of us arrived . upon arrival to the restaurant that has ' best lunch special N . N " on a banner above the door , we were told that groups over N people could not get the lunch special . we would have to order off the dinner menu , with basically the same offer as the lunch special but pay N . N per person . after the N of us had arrived , the restaurant was still empty . the owner continues to inform us that we cannot get the lunch special because we have N people . in a rude , and condescending tone he reminded us that we could order off the dinner menu which starts at N . N . the reason we asked a few times about our options is because we were actually perplexed . is it possible that an empty restaurant is going to refuse to give us the lunch special because we have too many people ? does he not want our business ? very confusing . we decided that the combination of false advertising and rude response from the owner was not worthy of our business so we went elsewhere . for all i know the food may be ok , but i won ' t find out . there are too many other good restaurants in montclair that treat their customers with respect . 
i went here twice . the first time the lamb lollies were fantastic and meaty . the second time they were about as big as a lolly pop . the other food wasn ' t much better . tasteless fish and chips . limp gorgonzola crostinie . the drinks were pretty good and the servers were very attentive . they kept asking us how everything was and how we were doing . me and my wife felt terrible for them . 
this restaurant serves the best mexican food in connecticut ! both the guac and the tacos are outrageously good ! the menu was out standing and had a great selection of specials . the was a excellent atmosphere there and the service was impeccable . superb beer and mix drink selection . the oaxaca margarita is to die for ! 
great store that stocks most essential japanese items . prices are good too . about the same or better than larger grocery stores and cheaper than japanese grocery stores in the city . great selection of japanese beers - don ' t see too many orion and hachiko at other asian stores . lots of parking in the area too ! highly recommended . 
the cigarette mushroom is indeed a good byob is great . great service . very small place . i am glad i tried , but i would not go back . 
i have never had a good experience at this place . it ' s great if your drunk and belligerent , because , only then , you will not notice the attitude of the service or the fact that they forgot about your order while you ' re standing right in front of them ! i just left . they do this to serve the best cold pizza in hartford , because that is the only thing that i have bought from them . delivery is a mistake , picking up didn ' t help , and ordering there and waiting is not worth the service . i tried to give them a chance for a while , because of the lack of good pizza in hartford , but they are bad . if you want good halal food , go to tangiers ! if you want pizza get domino ' s , very sadly the best pizza place in hartford , even with the bullet proof glass at the counter , seriously bullet proof glass . 
i went here the other night with a big group of friends . we waited for a group table and and got a few drinks . great beer on tap . when we got our table our server was on point . kept our drinks filled and took the order in a timely fashion . food was spectacular . salads , pizzas , you name it we got it . nice work ! ! 
sadly , i ' ve only been once . a friend did some cheap work on my house and i took him here , upon his suggestion , for a thank you . wow . first , kip behind the bar is great . second , i love a place i can fine dine sitting at a bar . the interior is very reminiscent of a victorian bar with dark wood , marble . . . lovely . the cocktails were all strong and inventive . served quickly and with care . ask for kip to make you his version of a manhattan . i ordered scallops . divine . i finished with the chocolate creme de pot , which kip said he ' s only ever seen one person finish because it ' s so rich . i took that as a challenge . i finished it . i didn ' t feel very good afterwards but i finished it ! chocolate lovers only there . great place for a date . . . great place for anything ! can ' t wait to go back ! 
the food is great but i have never gotten a good vibe from the staff . sorry , but it ' s true . you can ' t just get margaritas if you want a table- but drinks can really rack up so it would be in their best interest to let people have just drinks at a table . when cactus cafe was open my girlfriends i would go to the N margarita night and have a blast ! we miss that casual happy environment . 
i went to this place recently and was very disappointed with the overall experience . i try to go into new places with no expectations because i ' m more easily pleased when i do so . but having been to amada prior to this ( and loving it ) , reading reviews of both places , and comparing the menus prices , it ' s hard not to expect that the restaurants will at least be similar in quality and overall experience ( especially since they are both mainly tapas restaurants ) . the experiences are not even close to each other . i went with a group of N and we each got the tasting menu . the dishes were creative , but the quality of the vast majority of the dishes was disappointing . the meats they served ( lamb and pork over a thin slice of bread ) , for instance , were very fatty and just lacking in flavor . flavor quality was the main problem with most of the dishes . while the sauces and presentations were always nice , nearly everything that was served was disappointing . you will get the same type of variety as you would at any garces tapas place ( creamy rice with artichokes mushrooms , exotic sauces , meat wrapped figs , and generally small quantities of all dishes ) , but nearly none of these dishes will knock you socks off the way you want them to be knocked off . the sangria was particularly underwhelming . although it had a very similar description to the sangria that amada serves , the two are very , very different . tinto ' s sangria was tart and tasted mostly like wine . very little fruit taste and no touch of cinnamon at all . i would not get this again . the meal had its highlights ( service was generally good , and they served a real nice cut of sea bass toward the end of the meal ) and the dessert was very good , but for what you are paying , you just expect so much more . i would consider this place a notch below average when all factors are considered . i don ' t think i will be coming back here . 
this is my second stop at vesta and the food and service were fantastic . i was served by jackie and allison who were attentive , quick and friendly . i had the filet mignon special and every bite was heavenly . i would suggest this place to anyone looking for a great pizza place that also offers a great selection of beer in east rutherford . if you are not in the mood for pizza then definitely feel free to try their other selections as you can ' t go wrong . 
i haven ' t tried the burgers but from all the reviews . . i will have to try it ! my friends and i stopped by here before going to the popped concert this past weekend . their beer selection is better than the other bars around . this statement is biased as i wholeheartedly favor strawberry wheat beer and victory headwaters over other beers . yes , they have those and that is why i like this place . d the bartender was nice and friendly and so was the hostess . the hostess was very accommodating and even though she said the tables outside was for guests who planned to order food , not just drinks , she said it in such a darling manner that i wasn ' t even angry about being " rejected " a table . if you ' re with a group of friends on a sunny afternoon , go here and drink beer and be merry ! 
my son took me there today for a family lunch and it was my first time there . it was a surprising experience as i really did not know what to expect . we had the N-course tasting menu and the food was exquisite and expertly made . i can ' t say i recognize everything that was on the plate , but the blend of taste was unexpected . i didn ' t even realize it was a vegetarian course until the end of the meal . i would definitely come back again . 
great ambiance specially for a restaurant in east haven . this restaurant is perfect to take a date to and impress her or to go out with friends and family . the food is terrific specially the paella and the owner leo is a great person who is very attentive and makes sure you are N percent satisfied . will come back weekly and recommend it to everyone . 
my new favorite place ! i ' ve been living in murray hill for over two years and although i like the neighborhood , it always bothered me that the area is packed with sports bars and has no real quality bars . i usually had to go to the west village or chelsea . whitman and bloom is a game changer in the neighborhood . yes , the name is weird , but the place is absolutely gorgeous , very classic design with soft music and comfortable seating , great bar with a wide bar selection . i love wine so for me its always a treat to find a place with such a quality wine selection which fit a top restaurant . food was amazing , everything we ordered was great . not your typical bar food but actually high end gourmet food check out the lamb ribs , my new favorite dish ! prices are moderate and are definitely reasonable for that kind of quality food . it ' s a great place for a nice dinner or just sitting on the bar with friends . i usually don ' t bother with writing a review but this place is great ! great service , great food and great atmosphere ! 
great food and great service . first time at this restaurant and it sure won ' t be the last ! mushroom fries were spectacular and salads were fresh and yummy . 
nice place , friendly service . 
i love ippudo ramen . one of best ramen . 
the food isn ' t as good as the restaurant thinks it is . but the bar is the place to go when you want to feel like an adult . 
recently yelp reviews have disappointed me quite a few times , and this is one of the them . honestly i would probably give a N star , but i ' m a bit pissed off by the N . N stars and not very rational now . we went on a friday night , very friendly waiters and hosts , good ambiance if you want to grab a drink . however , it is way over priced for the food they offer . first , the waiter recommended us to order a seafood platter which is not priced on the menu , and later i found out from a yelp review , it ' s N . we only have N people . . . then he tried to sell us lobsters for entree . in the end , we ordered , guacamole- a small bowl for N dollars , very salty , i had to stop after N bites fish ribs- exactly as it described , can only taste the bbq sauce . . . i guess i shouldn ' t expect too much after all other people ' s raving reviews short ribs- ok portion , on the dry side fish stew-probably the most successful dish of the night . we were thinking about the parilladas , lucky we didn ' t get it . they are really small , u pay for all different type of sauces , and the nice display . all in all , i would not go bad . pricy and ok food , small portion . 
definitely worth stopping , shout out to hershel ' s deli . 
not a huge fan of this restaurant - i think it ' s extremely expensive for sushi - atmosphere is very pretty though - fun to go for night life
the only indian place i go to in the area ! you can get homestyle indian food without paying high prices . do not let the prices fool you - these guys offer the best quality food in the area . their malai kofta and chich tikka masala are a must try . its a small place with minimalistic decor . customer service is very friendly . highly recommended . 
i was happy to have had this place recommended to me . it ' s a little off the beaten path , but worth checking out for take-out or for a quick lunch . the wings were big and meaty . the sauces were tasty , but in our take out order , they all got mixed together in the same package . the counter service was excellent . they were friendly , efficient and recommended some great things to try for a first-timer . 
one word , poetic
cute place , good service . the truffle gnocchi had wonderful flavor , but was not the soft pillows of potato-ricotta i looked forward to-- it was more the texture of tater-tots . the bacon-wrapped apricot drizzled with honey and red pepper flakes was amazing and a definite try . 
fast and friendly . great for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ( i was surprised at how good their dinner menu was , with a wide selection to choose from ) . the wait staff is very friendly , and the owner is often around for dinner to check in and make sure you are happy with your meal . my daughter loves their pancakes . . . . their omelets are also quite good ( though lately the chef has been burning them slightly , so i ' ve chosen other items from the menu instead ) . nanny ' s chicken and vodka rig for dinner were among our favorites . a great local favorite . 
i went here in november during a business trip . the food was just ok - i ordered the seafood pad thai which seemed overcooked and lacking flavor . the ambiance was nice , but i ' d bypass this spot if i ' m in hartford again . 
awesome ribs the sauce the comes with is so good ! calamari is good too . the pad se ew isn ' t bad either , not the best but still pretty good . the prices are great ! 
manny ' s is open ! went there today , october N , N , and we are thrilled to report they ' re back in action ! prepared foods--flank steak , salmon , quiche , pot pies , and veggies sides , along with a full compliment of sandwiches . great coffee and baked goods to boot ( including a dangerous looking donut that i avoided with great effort ! ) . head on over bed stuy , and give ' em your love and support . 
what a great surprise this uptown food stand N Nam ! ! i should come uptown more often . . after a long night of partying . . . this is definitely hit the spot ! ! N chicken and rice rules ! ! ! there was a huge line N N in the morning but it was moving pretty quickly . . worth the wait ! ! very unique infamous food stand of nyc i would have to say ! ! ! 
great pizza and pasta dishes . crummy , at times rude , service . they make a lot of order mistakes but never apologize and don ' t seem to think you should be upset that you had to wait for things to be made right - kind of a " you get what you get " attitude . be especially careful on " to go " orders and have the person repeat your order back - at least then you have a N N chance of it being right . even with these problems i find myself going back after a while because i haven ' t found anyplace else that makes such good pizza and sausage and peppers - but i definitely go there a lot less than i would if they improved their service and attitude ! 
service was great . food was so-so . i was surprised because the food at dinosaur bbq-harlem is always on point . i will stick with the harlem location . 
i ' ve been to this place a couple times now and it ' s always been spot on delicious . the last time i went it seemed like it had new ownership perhaps ? the name had changed but it was the same restaurant and the food was just as good . lots of authentic dishes to choose from , their tacos are awesome so i highly recommend those , just be aware that the ones that are labelled ' spicy ' ( like the spicy pork or spicy goat ) pack a little heat , which is great if you like that like i do , but if you have a sensitive stomach try one of the milder options . 
my partner and i went a few weeks ago to jamonera as we had been wanting to try it for awhile and after coming home from spain have been looking for those flavors again . we were able to sit down at the bar and enjoy a glass or two of wine while we ate some lovely food options . the only lackluster part of the evening was the bartender that seemed put off when we were interested in ordering more food or wine ( he was clearly more interested in the friend person at the end of the bar with whom he spent N of his time talking with ) . overall i would go back in an instant just for the great flavors . 
perfect neighborhood byob restaurant . i used to live across the street so i really know this place well . it was always full each night and the whole simple decor and menu selections were great . the place was renovating in ' N when i moved . great to see that it ' s back ! 
if there were a half-star option , i ' d have given this N N N . pietro ' s is a pretty popular place , so it gets crowded , especially for lunchtime . however , they ' re on top of things when it comes to an accurate wait time , and when you are seated , you don ' t feel rushed . there is very , very dim lighting , so this may be a funky little place to take someone when you are not keen on being seen , if you know what i mean . i have typically ordered a pizza to share amongst three or four and we ' ve still always had leftovers . portions are rather large , but more so , the pizza isn ' t that spectacular that i want to overindulge . the soups are great , but for N . N a bowl for lunch , it never seems worth it . all in all , it ' s a good place to go when you have a small group and want to share , and you ' re not looking to really care about what you are eating . if i want really delicious italian food , i would go elsewhere . 
this was not made for the great meal to be devoured , a dim lamp was all i had been given , and patience without end , to shine it on the empty plate in front of me . i was a solid in the midst of other unkempt solids . i tried the salted salt with salt puree and braised salt . for dessert i had the warmed salt cake with salt dipping sauce . nothing to be done . 
what a great place ! we love the bloomfield location but really love the wethersfield one ! it is quieter and more intimate . the food was great . one of the best parts was the service . they were friendly and prompt . we will be going much more since it is close to home . 
an honest place . i ' d ditch the plastic cups and move to quality glass mugs or glasses , in line with the quality pub environment that they are building . i liked the beers , but if i were them i would commit the ultimate heresy and add budweiser or similar to the beer menu , since many of their potential bay ridge audience will want that . there is no reason why craft beer and bud cannot coexist . service was cheerful and competent . it was chilly in the back . they ' ll need to do something more when it gets colder . they ' re a welcome addition to the area , and i wish them success . 
my date and i went to ootoya for lunch , and we were quite disappointed . simply put , the service was atrocious . we waited approximately half an hour for ice water and another N minutes for our order to be taken . the food redeemed our experience slightly . i ordered the hokke teishoku , and my partner ordered the mackerel . the fish was cooked nicely , but some of the other components were lackluster . the oroshi ( grated daikon ) was bitter and spicy , which results from slicing the daikon incorrectly . the pickled vegetables were bland . and the chawanmushi lacked anything but runny eggs . perhaps it was an off-day , but the service and poorly prepared sides do not entice me to return . 
the pizza at jo jo ' s is hands-down the best in the area , even better than delorenzos which i think is way , way , overhyped . now mind you , the place is a little small but you can really enjoy a nice meal without breaking the bank in a cozy atmosphere . 
i don ' t think that amazing . . . . but the broth is very authentic . . . feels like it ' s from hoshu island . i am not a big fan of ramen in general , and this one is nothing in particular . . . . the soup is what makes it worth it . i like the decor though , and location is convenient . . . . a good post dinner or post volleyball place . 
great people , great food . one of our favorite restaurants . . . we started coming when this was a different turkish restaurant , troy kitchen . . . i think it was called . this place ' s bread and antep ezme are fantastic ! ! ! ! complaints ( N ) the muhammara was so much better in the former place . ( N ) the former used to have belly dancers on weekend nights . . . ( i do believe they have live music still . ) all in all , the best turkish place in new haven cty ( and possibly all of ct . . . 
great place ! delicious flatbreads and fun atmosphere . very crowded when we went ( N Npm on a thursday night ) , but we were seated within N minutes . may be tricky with larger groups , but a fun place to go on a date or with a friend . 
the food is delicious . my wife , daughter and i have gone there several times and have never been disappointed . the staff is always willing to help and make suggestions on what to order . i will definitely be returning . 
best thai in city . great prices . only wish they would take reservations because it gets packed . 
by far the best tuna sandwich in the financial district . . . . . . served on a warm thick pocketless pita with fresh lettuce and slivers of red onion . we collectively take out from there at least once a week . try it . . . you will not be disappointed
despite being an area with multiple options for take-out and delivery , this place is my go-to . the food is good , the portions are generous , but what keeps me going back is the service . everyone is kind and welcoming , and the woman who takes orders over the phone always remembers what you get if you ' re a regular . fantastic place with great service . 
checked this spot out last saturday night and it is in my top worst ny food experiences . the bacon was not good - i ' ve had better at a diner and they aren ' t touting bacon as their main squeeze . the service was equally as bad as the bacon . slow . our entrees came out N minutes apart . the burger came with no basics - like lettuce . we had to ask a few times for things . it was sad and annoying . the vide and table next to us didn ' t help either . this place has an identity crisis . are you trying to be a cool food spot or bar spot ? your doing both badly right now . net net - don ' t go . 
excellent pizza and exceptionally friendly staff . we had the margherita and prosciutto pizza , the prosciutto was our favorite . very thin and crispy crust with quality ingredients . lots of drink options . simple dining with community seating . 
very clean and nice but i hate the fact you have to pick from one or the other meat or non meat . . . what if you are going with a group of mixed eaters ? well my friend and i went with fish . . . even though i don ' t eat meat-i made a concession this time . everything was fresh . . . very fresh . the portions are so small that i was starving about N hours later . the veggies that accompanied the meal were also very very fresh . my chair also kept on getting knocked by employees with no apology . . . i counted at least N times while we were there . it was annoying . our waiter however was very nice and very accommodating maybe i should have told him about the chair knocking . ok we were also seated next to this loud annoying family . . . who i wanted to punch as they kept on getting up and down all i saw were butt cheeks the tables are so close together . i wouldn ' t come here again as there are i many better places to eat in nyc . 
hobby ' s is a beacon of food glory in an otherwise barren city . great corned beef and amazing matzo ball soup . chicken parm with pasta is great if you are in the mood for something filling , or bringing leftovers home . prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly . the cookies are great as dessert ! one of the best restaurants still around in newark . 
seriously good cheesesteaks , long lines though . and bad service . and only outdoor seating . and terrible prices . but . . . good ? 
N . N stars . i have never had georgian food before , so pretty much everything on the menu was a new experience for me . the restaurant itself is really elegantly decorated and the back displays a beautiful indoor garden and waterfall . this is a great place to have either a romantic date or a family gathering . adjaruli khachapuri - this was the reason why i wanted to try this restaurant . it is essentially a gourmet cheesy bread consisting of a a bread boat filled with a gooey georgian cheese topped with a runny egg . this glorified cheesy bread concept sounded amazing . unfortunately , right before we came here , we made the mistake of getting joe ' s pizza beforehand . we tried not to , but it was hard not to compare the two . the khachapuri though extremely fatty and high in caloric content tasted kind of bland . the bread was extremely fresh though . lamb khinkali - comparable to very large chinese soup dumplings . the skin has same texture . what surprised me the most was because of the appearance i expected it to taste somewhat similar , but it had a completely different taste . there was no asian taste , but it was still filled with delicious broth . this was a great appetizer . chaqapuli - this was the slow-cooked veal in white wine and tarragon sauce . it looked like some kind of soup full of green herbs and tiny pieces of veal , served with hot fresh bread . this is a very small dish and tastes very healthy , probably because veal is so lean . after the extremely heavy khachapuri , this dish was welcome . the waitstaff though friendly , mostly left us alone . i ' m not sure if i am a big fan of georgian food in the end , but this restaurant is definitely an interesting change from the general fare of cuisines new york offers . just make sure you don ' t eat joe ' s pizza beforehand , and i think the food would taste even better . 
as a bartender i ' m used to people getting out of hand and occasionally getting violent . the night after i was f ' d with at double windsor , a patron at my bar punched another guy randomly in the face . no one saw it coming . i realize its not fair to throw a place under the bus based on the actions of a few bad apples . however . . . my recommendation for bars without a bouncer , is to set the tone ! don ' t play song requests for drunk jerks . don ' t give free shots to drunk jerks . don ' t encourage drunk jerks to be drunker and jerkier . and please . . . stay reasonably sober behind the bar ! 
always fun and delicious , festival de mariscos is amazing if ur into seafood , its for N people usually but they do make it for one as well . meat wise besides the rodizio of course is the skirt steak . for appitizer i recommend the octopus in oo and peprika . the shrimp in garlic sauce , and the grilled portugese sausage . just tried the passion fruit sangria based on other reviews and it was right on . here to watch a world cup game and enjoy great portugese food . always a winner . 
best risotto , the four chesses is great waiters are the best , very friendly . 
i love this joint ! i think it ' s a great sandwich spot and love that it ' s owner operated , not a chain . the owners are cheery , and have very busy hands . we ate lunch here yesterday and a steady stream of people came in while we were there . it ' s clearly popular , and it ' s popular because everything is fresh , the people behind the counter are fabulous and it ' s a great deal ! as an aside , i especially like that they actually close for a short period of time to go on vacation each year . just further underscores that the owners are committed to their business , but also know the value of taking a break to refresh and rejuvenate . 
definitely a fan of the smith . although the atmosphere is noisy and very crowded but they always deliver on the food ! the cheese corn appetizer is amazing and the steak frites was to my liking ! i definitely recommend going there , but make a reservation a head of time on the weekend or go during the week ! 
i trusted my yelpers three years ago and took my mom and mother in law out to dinner for mothers day . my mom had never been to a nice restaurant before so i was trying to impress her . we looked at the menu and yeah , it was a bit pricey but i knew that . they , however , seemed uncomfortable . i wanted the food to get there so the flavors could do the talking . my mom ordered some veal cutlet thing and i don ' t remember what i got . all i know is that it was not good . actually , my mom got sick ! she already had some hesitations when she first got the plate but i guess she did not want to be rude and ate it anyways . never again ! overhyped , not quality . simple as that . i ' ve worked in italian restaurants and this was lackluster food . had better , moving on . by the way , it seemed to me they catered to their regular clientele because the chef spent most of his time chit chatting with certain people . no attention to us newbies blows raspberry 
the food gets N stars for being " good enough " but not really great . the salad was definitely the best part - it was pretty good . i wasn ' t as impressed with the N gratuity which wasn ' t really well labeled on the bill . i guess my waitress thought she was extra great , because she decided to keep my change and plop herself at the bar to chat with the staff . hope you enjoyed the N tip , because i won ' t be back . 
a quintessential new jersey italian restaurant . fresh pasta . classic dishes that are sure to satisfy . a restaurant that is comfortable and reliable . in fifteen years , never had a bad meal or an off night . 
i freakin ' love this place ! food is always delicious , staff is courteous , and on point . pork slap ale is always on hand as well , a perfect accompaniment to the light , filling , superb cuisine at this fine establishment ! ! ! 
my favorite sake bar in the city ! i had the apple sake the first time i went there and i have it every time i go there . it closes late so it ' s a good place to go to after having some drinks . my favorite is the chicken skin and the bbq specials . we got the fried frog legs , seaweed salad , chicken skin on a skewer , lamb chop , cabonera udon noodles , chicken gizzard with garlic sprouts , and steak with white rice ( they had no brown rice ) . the chicken gizzard with garlic sprouts was my main dish and because it was so bad , it dragged down the review . the garlic sprouts ( rare to find in america ) were a nice addition to the dish ( suan tai ) but not crunchy enough . the gizzards were basically fried and then drenched in a sweet and sour sauce . . . which made it really hard to eat . the fried frog legs were basically frog tempura and were just meh although the lamb chop was tender and juicy . overall , i suggest at least hitting up sake bar hagi at least once during your trip to nyc . 
already crowded despite coming less than a half hour after opening , diner has a wonderful , cozy feel to it that i really adore what ' s especially personable is the waitress writing down the specials on the table " cloth " while kneeling down as if you were a crying child desperate for food . while the enjoyable music plays up above , food is brought out promptly and is truly delicious . turning our attention to the tablecloth rather than the menu , my friend and i had ricotta pancakes with blackberry preserves and an omelet stuffed with goat cheese , basil , and summer squash . the pancakes were delightfully tender and creamy . . so much so that a knife becomes obsolete in the cutting process . the omelet was rich but not too heavy , and the spicy potatoes and salad that accompanied it were equally as tasty . with an ever-changing menu and a sprightly spirit , this place is worth coming back to several more times . 
there is sometimes a long wat but when you sit the food comes out right away . its delicious and i ' ve had most of the things on the menu . its also a great place to go during lunch and have a quick solo meal with a great ambiance . 
i have tried others because i love pierogies , but every time i eat them i always say they still don ' t match pierogies palace . if you want something different you found it right here . i always wonder why they haven ' t opened in other locations to spread this great product around . i will be moving out of state soon and wish they had a way i could get them delivered through express mail . even frozen and cooked these are awesome . 
i love their tea . . . they have a variety of flavored and bubble teas . the sandwiches are great as well . the staff is nice and very friendly ! ! my coworkers and i are regular customers during lunch time since we work nearby . 
got takeout the food was burnt and the hostess unfriendly
great food ! ! ! good for brunch . 
our friends took my wife and i here , and not having ever tried peruvian food , we were pleasantly surprised . the ceviche is awesome-some of the best i ' ve ever had . likewise the hanger steak dish i had was full of flavor . byob . all in all a fun place with great food and service . 
i am definitely a regular . they are open late nights . prices are cheap for alcohol food . everything is great . they always try to accomadate groups of any size . attentive and quick staff . my favorite izakaya ! food tips sashimi salad , mentai pasta , chicken meatballs shishito peppers . yum . 
really great coffee and tea , awesome atmosphere and the best part is the prices are perfect . food is also excellent but order ahead if you ' re in a hurry . 
i don ' t know why there are so many good review on this place . i mean i get it ' s " legendary " but i really ? there are flies all over the place . as for the burger . . meh . . it was tasteless . 
i found this place after readng yelp reviews . the location is a little off but once you entered the restaurant . i felt like i was in a little town in frence . very nice and friendly service . there was no waiting to get a table but the restaurant is so understaff that only one waitress was serving the whole place . she handled it professionally and always with a smile . amazing ! there was no menu to read because it was posted on the wall . the food was delicious indeed . we had fried osyters and tomato mazzrella as appetizers . we tried two seafood soup as well . for main entree , we ordered bronzino , cioppino , salmon and red snapper . i would say you can ' t go wrong with any kind of whole fish entree . the ciopiino was only ok , the texture of the lobster was disappointing . i have had better ones . we skipped desserts because we were full and it was getting late . but overall , it is a very romantic restaurant with great food to offer . the bill came out less than N for a party of four . great deal ! will sure visit again when we are in the neighborhood . bring your own bottle of wine ! bona petite ! 
get to the chase pros N ) cat fish was divine ! ! ! so soft and flaked right off . piping hot as well N ) cajun fries ! ? yes please ! ( too bad they ' re such small portions compared to ca ) N ) definitely an interesting experience ( bibs , surgeon gloves , getting right down dirty with that fish , energetic and excited vibe ) N ) um attractive staff much ? ) N ) thank god they have bathrooms , because there ' s no way that smell would get off your hands even with operating gloves on N ) cool that the waiters input the orders on a smartphone . very quick and practical cons N ) minimum hour wait . . . unless you eat dinner at N pm and you ' re a couple N ) really greasy , oily and buttery . . . . and not in a good way . . . felt like i chugged a bottle of canola oil or chomped on a stick of butter N ) damn crawfish were on a diet . . . definitely going to work hard for my food , because beneath all that breaking and snapping of shells , i had a N cm size bit of craw to eat . . . . hmmm something ' s not right ( and i definitely know how to shell them suckers ) N ) cash only . . . what is this ? why ny ? ! N ) pitcher beers can be avoided . . . very watery . . . felt like i was drinking at a frat party N ) it ' s one or the other , either not enough food so we had to order so much or too expensive . . . N combo bags , N fries , N pitchers of watery beer , N snowcrabs and N fried catfish for a group of N people came out to N person o o definitely an experience and i ' m happy they brought it to the east coast . . . but the heavy grease , wait , cost , and hit or miss with some of the dishes wouldn ' t warrant another visit for me imo . maybe the shellfish on the west coast are better . . . but it was an a-ok experience . 
love memphis ! i need to reveal that this is my ' local ' bar , so i might be a little biased . great beer list , awesome and knowledgeable staff , and fun , innovative menu . i recommend the beer battered dills and kielbasa hoagie ! 
i love honeygrow . i love the ordering process - reminds me of the screens at wawa . so convenient and easy . the only thing i ' d like them to add is a sign to show you where to order . the first time i was there , there was a huge crowd and i was confused of where i was supposed to go . we then thought there was only one screen to order from because the other screens were blocked and there was a huge line to just one . i also think they need to make sure that all the ingredients in the salad are actually in there . i ordered a salad that had sesame sticks . . . and they forgot . i was so excited then i was not . boo . otherwise , the salads are delicious . fast and fresh . 
i noticed that i only gave geronimo N stars before and i really don ' t know what i was thinking . this place rocks N stars without breaking a sweat . also loved hell night , a special spicy food lover ' s night that they do once a month . 
great food and always the best beers . the service is usually good although my recent waitress wasn ' t the friendliest . the bus boys are awesome ! definitely try the burger and mussels ! along with the bacon wrapped dates . good place to watch sporting events and outdoor seating available . 
i know everyone in nyc loves this place but it ' s ok - there is better pizza . you definitely need to go at least once - the old ambiance makes it an experience that everyone should have at least once ! 
amazing ramen , one of the best i ' ve eaten , even including ramen in japan ! the wait is a bit painful ( one hour in the nyc cold for N people ) but the service is good and the atmosphere ( extremely crowded ) even feels like japan . i ordered the mega ramen , as did the rest of my party . it was not overwhelming and the char siu meat was incredible . 
this is my boyfriend and i ' s favorite asian cuisine restaurant in town . he is vegan and i am vegetarian so finding a place to eat out can be tricky . hj house has multiple options and the staff is open with ingredients and more than willing to alter meals to accommodate . they have lots of ramen dishes , sushi , various salads , and tempura . their tempura is awesome ! they substitute all veggies for us with their tempura dish , using even mushrooms and avocados ( which is unbelievably tasty ! ) . my personal favorite is the fruit rolls , which is a sushi roll with fruit on top and a fruit sauce . it is so good ! i especially like the mango one . the best part of hj is that the price is great for the food you get . we recently got four appetizers and two meals and the shebang only came to N . N . highly recommended ! ! 
mojitos were good , black bean something or another was good . outdoor seating was a plus . love the ceiling fans swarming around as you eat , very pleasant atmosphere , although happy hour is a mess of extensions , makeup and . . well you know . . 
i had the cheesesteak with friend onions for lunch today and it was absolutely delicious ! best cheesesteak i ' ve had in a long time . not only was the food terrific but the staff and owner were incredibly friendly . i had such a great experience here , this is definitely going to be my top destination for lunch in the area ! great food , great prices , very friendly staff and ownership . 
this place is healthy and delicious . the groothie ( green smoothie ) is yummy , and the ceasar salads are awesome . only downfall is that this place is a bit pricey and the food isn ' t necessarily filling since it ' s soooo darn healthy . but if you don ' t mind spending an extra buck or two in order to have a healthy lunch - this is definitely the place for you . 
i was there last sat at N pm . our last N guests were running late but the host offered to seat us right away . the bread they gave us as we waited was nothing special . the crust was too hard . the olives were tasty though . when the full party has arrived , we ordered a whole bunch of tapas and as well as the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria . the sangria was excellent . not too strong and really refreshing . i , personally , loved the pulpo a la gallega ( octopus ) , the churrasco arriero ( skirt steak ) , the gambas al ajillo ( shrimp in garlic sauce ) , and the pan tumaca ( serrano ham and manchego cheese on toast ) . so delicious . we also ordered a pitcher of the red sangria- good but i preferred the blueberry . we ordered more food but the restaurant was so busy ( don ' t know when it happened but all of a sudden i noticed it was packed ) that we had to wait . and we waited what felt like an eternity . after inquiring about our food , our waiter raul brought us brought us a free plate of tapas ( i think the patatas alioli ) as an apology for the delay . and then some time after that he brought us a free pitcher of sangria . what ? so awesome ! ! when we got our bill we thought they overcharged us so raul very patiently explained each item to us . not once , but twice . i was cringing inside but he was so friendly , nice , and helpful about it ( turns out everything on the bill made sense , we weren ' t charged extra ) . we paid and as were leaving i waited for raul to come clear the table . i asked for his name , thanked him , shook his hand , and gave him an extra bill- i was that impressed with the service . without a doubt i am coming back here again . oh and i can ' t believe i almost forgot about the flamenco dancers ! ! they were fantastic . it really helped create a fun and festive environment . lol why bother travelling to spain , j come to nai tapas bar ! ! 
really delicious italian food in a warm , understated setting . it actually reminded me a lot of picollo angolo without the ridiculous wait . the pastas were all super delicious . the prices are reasonable . the location is great . definitely recommended ! 
happy to say my husband and i are regulars here . this place is amazing ! the food , the people , the atmosphere could not be more welcoming . my husband and i can be difficult to eat out with . i ' m a vegan with gluten and dairy allergies and the husband is allergic to nuts . we never have any issues eating here . the menu is labeled for vegetarian , vegan and gluten making all available options ( and there ' s plenty ! ) easy to spot . they are kind and caring about our food issues and never make us feel like were a problem . the food is unbelievable ! fresh , clean , flavorful . the drinks are great too . sangria is tasty and filled with fresh fruit . there was even one day where we came here for breakfast and then dinner . it ' s just so good . can ' t say enough good things about this place . only downside is we live too far for delivery . 
i am from buffalo , and last night i was dying for a good wing . when i say dying for i mean i had an insatiable craving for buttery spicy fried fowl . i did a lil searching and went to bonnie ' s grill . the gentleman who appeared to be running the restaurant that night immediately recognized me as his fellow buffalonian and introduced himself as a native of the tonatonawana . if you don ' t know that what means , don ' t ask . i order a plate of N wings , hot , xtra crispy . they came out exactly as ordered and were plump , nice sized wings . the only thing that distracted me from how delicious they were was the fact that i was washing them down with a N . N labatt blue . . . ! sweet lord almighty if you ' re from wny and want wings go to bonnies , they ' re not quite the bar bill , but they ' re a fantastic substitute while living down here . . ps dear bonnie ' s cheeseburger , i saw you sitting there atop your freshly grilled poppyseed bun , looking so wonderfully spiced and cooked to a perfect mid-rare . as you watched me me eat my wings i got the feeling that you wished you were on my plate . don ' t worry bonnie ' s cheeseburger . your day will come . 
the buttermilk-fried chicken and blueberry pancakes were great - but stay off the pizza . we also had the gin sling and lemon squash cocktails . they were really fresh , but pretty sour . definitely a great place for good food ! 
consistently good and fresh and actually pretty amazing considering the price . the veggie quesadillas are awesome--really anything with their sauteed mushrooms . the people working there are cool and very patient when you try out your pathetic spanish when ordering and picking up . their cart on the corner of elm and bway is great for lunch--fast and reliable . 
we love this place . we order from here a few times a week . we used to order chinese but this is a much healthier options . i love the tofu dinner box with brown rice . 
booked the back room for my mother in laws Nth birthday celebration . the food was absolutely fantastic and the service was second to none ! we had kids in our party with allergies and the restaurant was fully prepared and extremely accommodating . we booked lunch , which by the way is an unbelieveable value . i ' ve never had so much fun sitting down for a N hour lunch . the team made it most enjoyable and were extremely attentive . we will be back for sure . thank you ! thank you ! thank you ! 
last night my husband and i along with another couple decided to try max fish in glastonbury for the first time - we were mortified ! while the attention to our reservation was overly thorough ( two phone calls and an email that day ) , both the meal and the atmosphere were disappointing . the appetizers ( mussels , greek salad , caesar salad , mix salad ) were ok but the entrees - the stars of the show - were very disappointing . the poached fish was the worst . our friend eats fish most of the time and was puzzled by the whole meal . it was a soggy soup of overdone vegetables and some drowned trout finally located at the bottom of the bowl . the " san francisco " cioppino wasn ' t san francisco style at all . it was more like a bouillabaisse - no pasta and no spicy zing . it was just a pile of seafood with nothing to give it character . the black cod with honey mustard was satisfactory but the amount of bok choy , chewy and thick , was unbecoming to the rest of the dish . the pan seared scallops were certainly tasty but not overwhelming in amount . as to the atmosphere , the noise was highly intrusive . perhaps noise is something the max group cultivates to give the feeling of great popularity but restaurant sounds need to be properly harnessed to provide both quiet and social settings . clatter and chatter might be fine for the shark bar area but we sought an intimate dining experience and were mightily disappointed . in closing , you need to provide quality product not just window dressing if you want repeat business . we never mind paying the premium for sophisticated eating but this was poor performance . we will not return . 
good pizza , great price . i love how the cheese is melting and hot when it first comes out of the oven . but don ' t let it sit around ! the crust is thin and crunchy-just how i like it . ( if i want thick-crust , i ' ll move to chicago ! ) and their sauce to cheese ratio is just perfect for me . i try to catch a slice whenever i can get there . 
good food and prices
the service and the friendliness of the owner and staff is impeccable . you can ' t find this kind of southern charm anywhere but the south , so this is a gem ! the food is wonderful and they cater to vegetarians as well . i love their fried green tomatoes , mushroom gravy biscuits , homemade sweet tea , house made buttermilk ranch dressing , and the care they really take in the quality of their food . i ' ve been here several times with my roommate and the owner always comes up to chat with us and makes us feel super welcome . they deserve five stars all the way ! keep being awesome guys ! 
it is a very cool place . it is little bit pricey . i love their cheese pie . 
good mexican food in nyc is hard to come by . perhaps i am spoiled by growing up in los angeles but it must say something that tacos were my first second and third choice in la and fall somewhere down the list in nyc . dos toros is about as good as it gets here . ( the only better mexican food i have had is the taco truck on myrtle and wyckoff which i was too lazy to create a page for ) this place is similar to but way better than chipotle . the ingredients are delicious and heaped on . the meat is juicy and delicious . ( wasn ' t even trying to be sexual i am just that hot for this place ) i generally go with the carnitas but have never been disappointed when sampling a friends taco . ( again ) i ' m getting all hot and bothered just thinking about it . i love this place . the only thing keeping it from getting that fifth star is the seating situation . for the most part there is none . you will have to be pushy with the douchebags that don ' t exit upon finishing their meal or find another place to enjoy your meal . what is wrong with people that they cannot look around and see that there are other patrons in need of seats . they stole that fifth star from dos toros . that rant aside , as a connoisseur of mexican dining , i can assure you will enjoy your experience here . 
great calzones ! stopped by for a quick bite , great food ! 
awesome . . . i am a regular at makoto since its opening and love it . its by far the best sushi in a N mile radius on all accounts . by far the best presentation of sushi that i have seen outside of nyc and always fresh and delicious . the staff is very freindly and the decor is quaint and inviting for various occasions from a simple dinner to slightly formal . great place to take a date ! 
finally a place where si mangia bene and no attitude alla faccia di forno siciliano
not too shabby , came by to meet the lovely alayna one night , and couldn ' t remember the name for the life of me ! the beer selection is definitely something to be reckoned with , but the table layout ? kind of bizarre . thanks for letting me steal your electricity to charge my crackberry , though . 
learn how to order correctly ( " whiz with " cheese steak with fried onions ) or you will be deprived of the best cheese steak in town
there tripping there food use to be good a few years back but now they got popular and they are way more inconsistant . they only care about the money . the last time i got the david it was a shame i wish i had a camera to take a photo and upload it . what crap it was . i was a big fan but not anymore . 
when you ' re suffering from major jet lag and are wide awake at N in the morning , there ' s only one place to go the halal guys on Nth and Nrd . for N , the round tin of greasy gyro and yellow rice drowned in white sauce and hot sauce is well worth the gut-wrenching eater ' s remorse that follows shortly after . 
food is good , employees are very friendly . i like the take away lunch from here very much
- family staple , we usually get stuff to go ( would more frequently if it weren ' t so far ) - i wish i could recommend certain dishes . . . but i have no idea how to order them in english ! generally speaking , all of their noodle dishes are worth a go . however if you ' re craving wonton noodles , i ' d opt for big wing wongs - mediocre service - cheap convenient eats - generous portions
cozy and casual dining spot ! it ' s small but comfortable . the restaurant can fit N large groups at the most . the waitstaff are very prompt with the order . i love their lil ' buddha magnets on the counter as a business card ! order their chicken wings w honey soy , very crispy and sweet . i enjoyed the miso-glazed salmon with brown rice , light and subtle with the right amount of seasoning . my husband loved their sliced steak with cilantro and ginger and grilled asparagus , the steak was juicy and sliced perfectly . the mix of cilantro and ginger add an extra zest to the dish . we end our night over a banana cheesecake and a pot of jasmine tea . it was a great night out for a relaxing meal dessert ! we are definitely going back for their grilled lemongrass shrimp and grilled pork chop sandwiches ! 
loved the burrito ! it is such a cute restaurant , definitely tasted fresh and home-cooked ! a little expensive though for me to be coming back any time soon . 
after a long time i went back to this diner , i had a full dinner , they have fixed their service and better food being served the food was delicious , the staff and owner are wonderful people , i would recommend everyone in the neighborhood to give them a second chance . 
disappointing ! nothing healthy on the menu and the food was not very good . very , very slow service . 
ok i went with a small group of N was seated immediately no complaints there . jacqueline is a very nice woman . however , it is very , very small inside which makes it , very loud to the point i almost couldn ' t hear what the people in front of me were saying . now to the food not many selections to choose from the appetizers only mixed green salad and an antipasta platter . the pizzas are about N inches so your going to have to order N a person . it took at least an hour for the pizza to come out . we were about a bottle and a half of wine in before we were served our pizza . the pizzas were ok nothing crazy i havent had before . i will not be going back there . 
i ' m enjoying the hell out of le salbuen now , while i can , because i get the feeling it ' s going to blow up once word gets out . i ' ve only been for breakfast , but everything i ' ve tried thus far has been excellent . the ingredients are super fresh , the portions aren ' t out of control , and when you leave you feel genuinely energized . i spend so much time eating frozen veggie burgers and canned soup that every time i eat there i think " oh , right- this is what actual food is supposed to taste like . . . " 
came back to check out the new menu . me and my friend were looking forward to trying out the menu items . started off with the kobe beef sliders which were delicious ! also had to get the redstone lollipops since those were my favorite and i couldn ' t resist . thank god they didn ' t take them off the menu ! for my entree i had the seafood paella . i have to say for the price of N dollars i was amazed at the abundance of seafood and great quality of it . i give it two thumbs up . my friend had the veggie lovers pizza which she said was scrumptious and had just the right amount variety of veggies . for dessert we shared the chocolate molten cake . it was amazing ! the raspberry sauce added a great touch ! staff was friendly as always and the place was very clean . the atmosphere and ambiance is top notch . would recommend this place to anyone ! 
i love sketch ! ! ! ! the best burger in philly . 
if you are not sitting down to eat , go straight for the squares . they are awesome , stay away from the regular slices . also the heroes are very good . and of course can ' t forget the spumoni , best in town . 
i ' ve only been once . the seaport is a mess and was just looking for a quick drink and bite before a city cruise at pier N . this place more than hit the spot . very classy , extremely old new york flavor that i love . nice wine list and the apps were pretty tasty . the place had a nice vibe . it seemed like an off the grid wall street after work spot for the less stuffy members of that tribe . have not tried the full menu but will be back . 
i tried this place the other day . it was pretty empty and the tall heavy set bartender was not very interested in taking my order . he was busy chatting up some too young to date patron at the other end of the bar . she looked uncomfortable and i really don ' t blame her . and that is coming from a gay man . i had the crab cake sliders and my boyfriend had the calamari . the sliders were served on an unclean plate . - if you can get over that disgust they tasted pretty good -not great . calamari was so rubbery it could have doubled as a bungee cord . if you want a good experience , don ' t bother coming here
great bar , great food , great service ! as a local i would suggest it to tourists and other locals alike ! keep up the good work elixir ! 
can ' t really say too much good about the quality of the food and service here . we opened with a delicious artisanal cheese plate and saut ed nantucket bay scallops with a nicely balanced bandidi chianti . vermont pork , quinoa croquettes and their own cured pastrami and home-canned peaches filled out the meal exquisitely . the roaring fireplace rounded out a wonderful snowy evening . 
love this place . i was introduced by some friends of ours and i ' m so glad we went . the food is amazing and so is the environment . they also do nice little birthday stuff . the seafood pot is delicious as well as all the meats . i ' ve never had any issues at this place . i recommend it to everyone . this is something you have to have an empty stomach for and at least N-N people . its a lot of food . 
this is my local goto for pizza . staff is friendly and the food is always good . i live close so i pop in and pick up food to go . reg pizza , sicilian , margarita , all very good . zeppole are very good . 
i ' ve had many many xlb throughout my life , the best is still din tai fong dumpling house from taiwan . joe ' s weren ' t bad , but the skin on the dumplings were still too thick . it was deliciously juicy nonetheless , and the crab dumplings were even tastier . i recommend getting both the crab and the regular to compare ! we arrived before N on a saturday , only waited N min . it may look like alot of ppl but it moves very quickly . 
that fried chicken was the best i ' ve ever had . 
one of the most exquisite , quaint , beautiful dining experiences i have ever had was at this hidden little french gem . paris in brooklyn . i am a chef myself and decided to venture out on my one night off to enjoy a meal not cooked by myself . let me tell you , , , , upon arriving in cobble hill and finding this place i was blown away . the wine is wonderful , atmosphere is extremely ambient , and food . . . . . always a pleasant experience . i make it a point to visit as often as i can . you cannot pass up the appetizers they are heavenly , always a wonderful risotto , oysters are so fresh and sexy ( you cant stop eating them ) , tuna is so decadent , the lamb sausage and corn polenta will knock your socks off . entrees i try something new most nights but have to say i ' m partial to the duck . the skate is unbelievable . dessert . . . . . . . . wow ! ! ! from beginning to end this meal is an unforgettable experience . the prices are reasonable , service is very good , and its worth a splurge and a trip to the cozy beautiful cobble hill area . 
excellent find on the uws ! i didn ' t think i would ever find this kind of bar restaurant on the uws . large space yet feels very intimate with the lighting and candles everywhere . i came on a thursday night and probably waited N minutes to be seated . they text you when the table is ready . the menu was descriptive and very interesting ! it was pretty loud in there especially towards the back area which resembles a beer garden due to the communal tables . the front half of the place is more of a restaurant . i immediately felt a rush of energy walking in . the place was very lively and vibe was youthful ! i hear wait time is super long on the weekends and i can totally see why ! they have a large variety of excellent and crafty beer selections . they were out of the banana beer which my friend wanted though womp womp . i had the " rosemary vodka lemonade " for N . it was decent . at first i thought it was a little weak but it crept up on me quickly . the food is delicious and of course it goes without saying that they have tons of different pickle flavors . i ' m a lover for anything sour ! lemon , pickles , olives , you name it and i probably have them stocked in my fridge ! this place was my little own heaven on earth . the burger and fries were excellent and not too greasy . perfectly cooked . truly love this place . they opened dec N and i can ' t believe i hadn ' t found them until now . def go ! 
i expected to have to wait N hours . . . . they told me N mins . . . i ended up waiting two hours . the place was packed , if you are claustrophobic go at a very odd hour . it gets crazy in that waiting area . but the dining area is not stuffy at all , in fact it ' s very spacious and nice ( great date place boys ) i got the spicy miso ramen and my friends got the modern . get the modern . it ' s more balanced . the broth is cleaner and not as oily as the counterpart . the ambiance is great . the pork buns were really awesome . the bun was nice and fluffy , and i like mayo so it was good but others in the party thought there was too much ! the cute waiters and japanese speaking staff definitely help . 
in my opinion arusuvi restaurent is the best indian restaurent . people are extremely nice and helpful . i tried their chole ( chick peas ) pakora ( mixed vegetable ) . my friends has been dreaming about the chick peas . 
fabulous ! ! ! tight quarters inside - unbelievable food ensures you don ' t care . guacamole fresh , fresh , fresh . i had a amazing dinner at this place . drink floor y luna - vodka , st germain , lemon juice , mint and blackberry pur e . is one of the best cocktails i ever had ! ! ! dinner ceviche - ref snapper , mole line juice , avocado , and jalape o . delicioso ! ! ! ! entree chilpodito jarocho . is a sea food stew ( the best in the menu ) . and no price at all ! ! we skip desert . but am sure they r great ! ! service is awesome ! ! and friendly ! ! ! next visit will be brunch . ! ! ! and soon ! ! ! 
we went with a big group so we got to try a wide variety of appetizers , main courses and desserts . the service was not great , but the food was fantastic ! our favorites were the tom yum soup , crispy watercress salad and drunken noodles . only the frog ' s legs were a bit of a disappointment ( dry and boney ) . the coconut and green tea ice creams were also lovely . we can ' t wait to go back and sample more of the menu . we ' re also looking forward to sitting outside on the back patio , which looked like a very appealing place to dine . . . if only it had not been raining . 
if you like chicken fingers , this place should be on your bucket ' s list . i ' m somewhat into chicken fingers and this place has pushed me into the loyalist camp--i ' m going back as soon as i ' m in the area again . the chicken is served hot and crispy , so tender and the dipping sauces are off the wall . i got chocolate bbq and thai peanut . i had the classic tenders , but my friend got the wasabi tenders which were also amazing . we shared sauces . he had tomato aioli and sunny mustard . with my meal ( i had a three piece which was surprisingly filling ) , i also had a strawberry peach drink which was organic and only moderately sweetened . this drink was so tasty . they also have cane sweetened mexican coca cola , which is the tits . although the place is relatively small and the seating is minimal , this is a fetish joint . this place is going to change the chicken finger game forever . i highly recommend that you give it a shot if you ' re perusing the area . 
delightful . charming . great food . service wonderful . it is a gem to find a unique spot that makes you know that special still lives somewhere in ny . . . at the hourglass tavern
i ' ve only been here once , but i sincerely enjoyed it . i ' m only about a block or two away and was looking for a restaurant to eat at with a friend after moving in . we ended up choosing this over the pizza , sushi and chinese places on the same street . we sat outside , were served reasonably quickly ( though we weren ' t in a rush , so it wasn ' t a problem ) , and had delicious food . the cheesesteak was one of the best i ' ve had ( and as a philly area-native , i ' m picky ) , and my friend had a burger and enjoyed it a lot . the fries are awesome . can ' t speak to the alcohol as we didn ' t get any drinks . i ' m dying for another reason to go . 
this huge place is a hidden gem in brooklyn ! was there today for the first time . had little trouble finding a parking space however worth the wait ! we also got a chance to meet the owner , a really nice gentleman . inside is very spacious and nicely decorated . bathrooms are so clean and modern . i loved every corner of this place . their display cases are very organized and makes you want to eat everything . very large selection of cakes and pastries . ! we ordered breakfast platter with an omelette . everything was fresh and done so nicely . delicious food , very friendly staff . our waitress was very helpful . this place could be a great place to celebrate all kinds of events . 
let me start by saying i ' m a " diner guy " . there is nothing better than a good new jersey diner ! imagine how excited i was to see that the jersey diner opened right in my neighborhood ! i ' ve been there for breakfast , lunch and dinner . the food is amazing . seriously , i never had a bad meal there . they also have prime rib nigh on tuesday nights for the very reasonable price of N . N . the service is great , the food excellent , and chris the owner is there all the time , and very accomodating . they also have one of the best onion soups i ever tasted . 
great beer on tap at a great price . had a bunch of small plates and a burger , which was very good . i even liked the vegan food that we ordered . i never thought i ' d love brussel sprouts . even my N year old ate them ! ! ! 
thank you for resurrecting yourself into a new restaurant . i love this place . the burgers are great and the beer excellent . i live right around the corner and was so disappointed when it ' s precursor pomme deterre closed . but , in the end i find the ox cart to be be better and i have become a much more regular patron then i was at pomme deterre . i like it better because there is a bar with a happy hour , a tv to watch sports , and hearty less expensive food . like pomme deterre the service is friendly , social , and attractive . it ' s cozy . i was a regular at the farms on cortelyou rd . and i still like it , but now that i ' ve found the ox cart i rarely go there anymore . i prefer the location and the happy hour drinks . i am a draft beer drinker . i ' d love them to have a larger selection and this is my main criticism . they only carry N choices and sometimes make choices that i wouldn ' t . the farms does have better beer , but they charge too much for it . i like their burgers better than many more expensive places i ' ve visited . i only have a burgher maybe N of the N or so times i ' ve been here . the specials are good also and the portions large . i love the trout . i would like them to have more seafood and a regular mussel appetizer . also the bread could also be improved and served with more meals . 
i eat out every night in new haven because i don ' t own any food . this is by far the best value in town you can get half orders of food that are still great portion sizes for half the price . the outdoor patio is great during the summer . friendliest staff in town . this is by far the best value deal in new haven . 
coming from eastern north carolina , i have a special place in my heart for pulled pork bbq in that tangy vinegar-based sauce . but , i must say that percy street ' s texas-style bbq is pretty darn good . the meat really stole the show here . the chicken was some of the most tender and moist i ' ve had . it was lean , and they cut it up for you so it ' s easy to eat . my boyfriend got the pulled pork , which he loved , but i thought the smokiness was a little overpowering . then again , i ' m partial . the collards were tasty , the pinto beans were sweet and smoky but could stand to have more beans than meat , and the german potato salad could use a little more acid . the fries with cheese and brisket had a nice flavor , but the brisket was a little fatty . we got the root beer float for dessert , but i would pick the much raved about pecan pie or key lime pie next time . the ice cream scoops were just too small for my liking . and yes , there will be a next time . i ' m going back for the mac and cheese and cornbread . 
i ' m sad to see some of the bad reviews of this place , because it really is a neighborhood favorite of mine . since i live only a N minute walk away , i ' ve had a lot of opportunities to enjoy the outoor seating at llama tooth . their menu is creative and they always have unique specials to offer . i ' ve been here for brunch and had some enormous and flavorful french toast . in the evening , i always split a burger and a salad with a friend ( especially the asian salad , or the romaine hearts ) . try to keep this on the dl , but they also have great late night drink specials on fridays , and what could be better than lounging at a tiki bar with cheap drinks on a warm summer night ? i would easily give llama tooth N stars , but i really don ' t like their indoor seating ( not cozy at all ) , so i don ' t like to come here when the weather isn ' t nice . 
seriously ants pants ? it ' s time to step up your game . i ' ve loved you for a long time but recently the quality and consistency seems to have slid downhill . today ' s chicken red pepper avocado sammy was an embarrassment . smearing a rotten avocado all over my baguette ? did you think i wouldn ' t notice ? wilted lettuce for the salad ? for N ? also , when i order a bagel sandwich to-go , if you could do more than throw the thing in a paper bag ( wrap it in foil ? ) that would be great . the details count . don ' t make me break up with you for good ! 
only thai food i have ever had and i liked it a lot . would recommend . 
came here with my boyfriend for his birthday . we both loved it . yes , the wait was long , but having read all the yelp reviews we knew to expect that and just walked around for a while . we had a whole mess of different things ( too many for me to remember ) , but everything was delicious . my favorite was the deep fried tofu in broth ( sorry , can ' t remember its name ) . yum . it ' s so much fun to be able to try a million different dishes that you ' ve never seen before . and the prices are very reasonable - we only spent about N but given that we ordered a lot and had sake , i thought it was quite cheap . 
one of the best burgers in the city . period
the sesame pancake with peking duck was delicious . the peking duck played a minor role to the sesame pancakes . the was a crispness to the outside of the bread but somehow it was still tender and fluffy on the inside . the flavor of it without the fillings were just as yummy . the pork and chive dumplings are cheap , yummy and homemade . the dough was just the right thickness and had the nice crispness from the wok . you can ' t beat the price . . N for N dollar . they also have frozen ones , back of N for N dollars . 
me and my boyfriend happened to walk by eb strong ' s while on a stroll on church st . we were lucky enough to take part in their soft opening . i have to say the food was amazing ! ! ! i had the diver scallops , which were absolutely wonderful , and my boyfriend had a prime rib eye . we had oyster sliders and ahi tuna for an appetizers and they were out of this world ! ! ! ! ! ! finally someone does a prime steakhouse in vermont ! ! great wine list , and the staff is very professional and friendly . we will be going back again very soon ! ! ! 
the hostess here is the worst in manhattan . . . . seriously . . . she is a shrill witch . i have never been treated so poorly to gain access to food that i would describe as a b at best . while the owner did try to make up for her bad attitude he never got her to apologize which is the one thing that would have gotten me to at least change my mind on the restaurant . the owner is a nice enough guy but that hostess is just the absolute worst . there is an argument that this place is good for their drinks . . . not really . if you want drinks of that quality go to one of the dozens of " specialty cocktail " places nearby . whatever , i am just venting now . . . hostess . . . you suck . food b on their best day . . . which is almost never . 
i really like the food here and appreciate a casual byob environment . the menu easily pleases everyone . every plate i have tried has been tasty and well portioned . the staff has been the stand-out to me they are extremely friendly people and i always have an extra enjoyable time when i ' m here- no matter the size of the group . they never rush us or keep us waiting , and are helpful when it ' s hard to narrow down the options . it ' s a reliable casual spot that i am happy to have in my neighborhood . N of us ordered mains only and our total including tip was N- can ' t beat that . 
the bread , wine and appetizers were great . our entrees on the other hand were disgusting . i got the zuppe di pesce ( assortment of clams , calamari , filet of sole , shrimp and scallops over pasta ) the fish was overcooked and had a strange taste to it . my boyfriend got the frutta di mare special , his pasta was mushy . last but certainly not least . . . i found a long piece of blonde hair in my dish . . . . i have jet black hair by the way . when i called the manager over , which i hate doing because i ' ve served as a waitress before and i know how terrifying the feeling is , he tried to argue with me that it wasn ' t a piece of hair but that it was a part of the calamari . i tried to keep my comments quiet so the people next to us wouldn ' t be disturbed but he kept telling me it wasn ' t hair . his debate was ruined after i held up the long piece of following hair over my plate and said " this is hair buddy " he then took my plate away and did not charge me for my meal , thank goodness . 
visiting here from atlanta and went here for a group dinner . the food and service was excellent . cool view of grand central station . 
possibly the closest you ' re going to get to new orleans in nyc . this little treasure has the best ambiance and it actually feels like you ' re in nola . the food is delicious and cooked to perfection . things i tried crawfish bordin balls- yum pork bordin balls- yummmmm abita shrimp- -d -d -d chicken po boy- enormous and very tasty ( craving it as i ' m typing ) mac and cheese- better than kraft , best mac cheese i ' ve had to date note you have not had the full experience until you check out the bathrooms . they are adorable . 
N N N i know . . . i know . and i hyped this place up so much , since i had sammy ' s in queens . . . and i would have been the first person to tell you to go here . . . but . . . i ' m sorry , i did not like it at all . i ordered chicken and lamb combo over rice . i got the white sauce and hot sauce on the side . i don ' t know if the abundance of meat on the cart freaked me out , or the empty hot sauce , or the fact that they don ' t put the sauce on for you . i don ' t know . all i know is that i was pretty nauseous after eating it , it was not as spicy as sammy ' s , and it was not as tasty as sammy ' s . i even waited ( i hate waiting if i don ' t have to ) for about N minutes just to try it ! now i am not going to say it was horrible because it wasn ' t . it was ok , but i didn ' t finish it either . if i were you , i would at least experience once just so you can say you ' ve been there and you can compare it to others . it is not a bad meal , but i also haven ' t had a craving for halal . . . and with sammy ' s i actually wanted halal the next week ( 
brunch review if you can get here at a decent hour ( between N N am - N N am ) you might be able to get a table outside . if you aren ' t that lucky , the inside decoe is cute and the music is surprisingly good too . i was just really happy to get a table outside so i could bring the dog to brunch . we ordered eggs benedict on top of a homemade english muffin ( no thomas ' english muffins here ) with a hint of lemon hollandaise sauce . it was pretty on point . i don ' t usually like hash , because it reminds me of mushed meat and potatoes , but the short rib hash was pretty good , much better than the normal hash . i ' d definitely come back for brunch to try some of their other dishes and can ' t wait to try their market menu for dinner . my only gripe is that it ' s pretty expensive for brunch . 
after a legendary meal at yakitori tori shin a few months ago , i decided to go down the japanese route again during a recent trip to nyc when i was staying with a friend up the street on amsterdam avenue . when it comes to the hot asian soup category , i ' ve gotta say that i ' ll always be partial to pho ( that ' s probably the houston in me talking ) , but of course , that doesn ' t mean i ' d ever turn down a good bowl of ramen , and reading the reviews , i expected nothing less from this joint . there was a long line outside on a sunday night , which appears to be par for the course , but luckily as a solo diner , i was slipped in to a bar seat after maybe N-N minutes . those of you with friends and or people who care about you and your well-being will obviously wait longer . once i got situated at the bar , i made my order and got my bowl of spicy pork ramen with a draft asahi inside of five minutes it was cool to see the staff crank dat order out assembly-line style . i quickly got to slurpin . what made this ramen so good was that the broth was simultaneously spicy enough to make my nose run but not so spicy that i didn ' t want to keep drinking it down as fast as possible . it was also fatty and flavorful without being too oily or overly salty , which is also a deceptively thin line to walk when it comes to this stuff . there wasn ' t a ton of meat in the bowl for eleven bucks , but the pork i did get was good enough , and the noodles thankfullly had enough body to avoid going soggy before i finished the bowl . it all made for a good , solid meal for an autumn or winter night . would i wait for hours just to get a bowl of this stuff ? nah , probably not . but that doesn ' t mean this isn ' t pretty great on its own merits . 
so after hearing about jimmy ' s from a few different places i had to come and check it out myself . its a tiny place in the middle of a block in a residential area and you can easily miss it like i did . parking isn ' t to bad which is a plus . when you walk in it looks like an old school luncheonette . there is a wrap around bar and a few tables to the left which one waiter handles with ease . its dimly lit with a really chill atmosphere . every time we go we are always seated immediately , but we can see there being a wait on all the time . menu is pretty extensive and the first time went a little overboard . this place is not for the dieting type . everything is touched with the fryer ! so let ' s get down . . deep fryed deviled eggs was interesting . a tad dry . super crunchy . dipping sauce was a mayo with hot sauce which was delish . grits with cheese was super creamy and delicious def something to get off the menu if you like grits . fried pickles was a huge portion this was super good nice and crunchy and a great tartar dipping sauce mac and cheese with bacon this was another huge portion but it was amazing very cheesy with salty bacon fried chicken and waffles the best ive had . waffle was crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside chicken was great juicy . crust was crunchy and seasoned perfectly . putting syrup on the chicken made it that much better . fried chicken platter with saut ed broccoli and tater tots this too was spectacular tater tots was crunchy and moist , flavored perfectly broccoli was garlicky goodness . there was a brown gravy that was so good on this i wanted more . caramel milkshake out of this world delicious ! ! heres my beef with this place . . they are kinda dirty . . they make you know it . . they take the butter off one table and put it on another same thing with the syrup . kinda grosses me out . if they do that , what else do they do ? last inspection wasnt that great either . . so thats why i gave them N stars . . its to bad . . get your stuff together and i ' ll be back for your amazing food ! ! ) 
awesome food . great dishes , so fresh . the service is also awesome . they were super friendly and when they had no seating , N of us sat in the bar area and made our own space and they were accommodating and friendly . and the food was well worth it . i would definitely go again if i ever get back to vermont . 
feels like the french quarter when you taste the fried oysters , so so juicy but fired like ya mamma did it ! love the hot sauce on da bread , N N a crab in the gumbo , i shredded it ! i can not wait to go back . very small but not a deal to me i could take it to the park and eat . the guys the run the joint are just good ol nice guys . i loved the faces on the wall . oh yeah i got da N N N N and could feel home with the abita beer ! 
was here last week with a party of N , we sat outside even though it was a bit warm . the outside dining experience was really pretty . service was great , our waitress was very attentive and gave us suggestions as we had not been here before . food was very good . pulled pork was amazing ! i am so happy to of found a mexican restaurant close to home . 
the one , the only - big stash ' s . the stuff of legend . greatest sub you will ever eat and still going strong . i now live in the shore but when i do get a chance to visit the old neighborhood , i bring back at least a half dozen subs for the family . try their tuna sub . . . i dunno what they put in their tuna but it is incredible ! ! try it with a clinton ' s iced tea ! ! 
great traditional french food , such as moules-frites combined with a nice ambiance and reasonable wine prices . really enjoyed my meal here and the owners were really friendly as well . 
i had a chilly cheeseburger with fries and my wife had stake fajitas . food did not taste bad , in fact it didn ' t have much taste at all and was just bland . the food was also slow in coming . the waitress was very polite and kept interrupting our conversation every N minutes to see if we needed anything . environment was run down with cafeteria style tables and chairs . urinal did not flush in men ' s room and the stall was being used to keep cleaning supplies . 
it was ok - not great - not bad . got charged for guac i did not order . rather unfriendly . 
came here on december N , N i would give this place N stars if i actually ate anything , but the ambience is definitely great for date night . we stopped in here after dinner , after a day of wandering the city , shopping , walking while it snowed , rained , combined with gusty winds ( sometimes combined ) , so it was a welcome retreat . back room feels like a nice living room with leather furniture . quiet enough to talk . the server never forgot about us and left us alone after we had ordered two drinks each . 
everything about this place is good , but especially the food , really the most delicious italian food , simple dishes with fantastic combinations of flavors . the other night i had a special pasta an agnolotti type pasta filled with fontina in a black truffle sauce with brussel sprout leaves . wow . i am not even a fan of truffles because i find them too strong but this dish was so savory with just the right amount of truffles , . . the combination of flavors was special and made for a very tasty dish . emporio is fast becoming my go-to for meeting a friend for a glass of wine and supper . 
get the duck period . Nnd , get the seafood noodle soup . place has lota different noodle soups and from my experience all have been delicious . prices are very reasonable for quality and amt of food you get . you come here for the food , not the service . 
so underwhelming . had bone-in filet . asked for medium , came out really rare . first bite ? gristle . whatever you expect for N , this ain ' t it . also tried friends ny strip . not that tender , with minimal flavor , other than the pool of butter it was sitting in . can honestly say the ny strip sold at wegman ' s market is better . what a shame
the wait wasn ' t that long . the ika appetizer was yummy ! the ramen was of course excellent ! add the egg and pork belly to make it even better 
definitely popular when we called in without a reservation on sunday evening around N ! restaurant fully booked but they managed to find s place for us at the bar and we enjoyed a few small tasters from the menu . falafel was perfect , pita just right and the coffee very authentic turkish . it ' s definitely worth a visit and for a popular new york spot we were blown away by the reasonable bill ! 
so , don ' t make this a destination . we came here after a day up in northern jerz and we had a gift card so it was perfect . i was kind of excited from some great yelp reviews and i often hear about this place since it ' s supposedly a beer mecca . which , i ' ll give it up , it is . the place is pretty big , with a super large outdoor space as well . this place is definitely a hot spot for the locals . fair enough . however , i didn ' t enjoy the meal . to be fair , i only had the crab dip and a salad and my man ordered i believe the reuben . the crab dip many people have talked up in reviews was not so delicious . it was super creamy , super fishy and just didn ' t have flavor . served with a loaf of stale french bread . nothing about this app was great . i ate it but , still wasn ' t a fan . the salad was good however , nothing out of the ordinary and again , their homemade dressings . flavorless . like no flavor at all . my mans reuben wasn ' t a winner either . his comment lacked flavor . fries were good ) overall , i think this is a great watering hole , with a huge variety of beer , i ' ll just stick to the beer next time . 
great seafood experience . it ' s a little tight waiting inside for your table ( and if you go from N-Npm on any night you will be waiting at least N minutes ) . it is very much so worth it . i don ' t believe i have ever had anything bad on the menu , i have never tried the meat dishes , just the seafood appetizers and entrees . they even gave us a free dessert without even asking , real nice . 
tourist trap . nuff ' said . 
what an adorable little space ! came here for brunch one day . service was excellent , though perhaps the decor was a bit dark for a brunch gathering -- this place would be lovely and romantic for dinner . did i mention they have a bar ? the prices were decent and the cocktail menu was intriguing , but i wasn ' t there for booze . i ordered the shrimp and grits . the grits were a bit drier than i hoped they ' d be , and there were only three shrimp on the plate . a good number of tasty chunks of fried pork belly and a spicy cream sauce helped out , but i wasn ' t blown away . one of my friends got the monte cristo , which was massive . i was told it was good . the huevos rancheros looked like a winner too . probably deserves a three based on food for me , but service was great and it ' s a charming place , so N from me . maybe i ' ll come back for dinner some time . 
new owners are wonderful people and keep the pj ' s of princeton tradition alive with great food at reasonable prices . most recently had delicious silver-dollar pancakes with ham and good coffee . can ' t wait to return for some of the non-breakfast items ! 
you can ' t get a better sicilian pie anywhere ! the sauce is awesome and the crust is perfection . . . nice and crispy on the outside ! the round pie is good too but the square pie is the bestest ! i have been coming here since i ' ve been able to walk . first place us brooklyn people go as soon as the weather warms . . . get a slice and eat it outside ! then we get one of their ices . their restaurant food is pretty good too . . . good chkn parm . . . broccoli rabe . . . . great seafood salad ! 
everything about this restaurant is perfection ! good food and service all the time ! 
this place is pretty good for fast middle eastern food ! 
came in for drinks and snacks after work . the liquid sunshine cocktail was fantastic ! the steamed clams were really good . . . save some bread to soak up the juices . fried calamari was pretty good and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty good . nice atmosphere and the acoustic guitar group was some nice entertainment . will come back . 
great food and great service . i cannot say enough great things about this place . the owner is always there greeting people and making it a warm and inviting atmosphere . if you are considering this place , definitely do it . you will be happy . 
this place is fantastic . the food is fresh , delicious , and -- on the whole -- pretty damn cheap ( fresh-from-the-oven pita for N ? yes please ) the people who run it are lovely and the portions are generous . the only downside it ' s cash only . 
i visit this place every time i ' m in philly . big portions and great service ! ask to sit outside if it ' s nice out
overpriced , small and boring . me , my wife and another couple joined fitler dining room last night for dinner and i wish we had gone to vernick , will byo or serpico . nothing left a poor tasted in my mouth , but i wouldn ' t order any of the ten dishes again . i challenge you to spend N in philadelphia for a table of four and walk away without tasting one memorable plate . the most infuriating part of the evening was getting home and watching my wife eat two slices of pizza while i ate three . why two stars and not just one ? the waitstaff was excellent . 
my fianc e and i decided to go to pellegrino ' s after looking at the reviews . we are both glad we decided to have lunch there . we were seated immediately and the waiters and servers were friendly and knowledgable . the wait for our meals also was not long at all . i ordered the pollo pastore and it was by far the best meal of chicken i have had in my life . my fianc e also enjoyed her salmon . we were both thoroughly impressed overall and needless to say pellegrino ' s will be our lunch and or dinner destination when we visit nyc again . 
we live only a few blocks away , ( walking distance ) , and have frequented the continental weekly , either to eat in or take out . after the terribly rude service from the owner on new years , we will never return . the food was always ok , there is certainly a restaurants in the area , with much better , the beer selecation is nice , ( as far as my husbands concerned ) , and the drinks we ok . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . it was always generally a pleasant experience for a small bar , often very loud . . . . . . . . . but we will no longer spend a dime there again . . . . . . . . . . 
small and cozy . this place ha great traditional food . ill certainly be returning next time i ' m in the city ! 
disappointing , not cuban , bad service . . . 
can ' t beat the desserts . however , the food was pretty good too . the only negative was the long wait for a table . we had to catch a show so we ordered take-out and ate it outside ( in N degree weather ) . would definitely return . 
went there on a monday at noon when they weren ' t busy . it was N degrees outside and we are not teenagers . no one acknowledged our presence for at least fifteen minutes . no water was brought to our table . service was very poor . if you asked a waiter for something , they wouldn ' t do it because it wasn ' t their job . they have divided responsibilities . the sicilian pizza was delicious . meatballs were mealy . they brought the wrong salad . i will not return to this over hyped restaurant . 
bailing on this former gem . after having two close friends getting food poisoning at this restaurant , i will have to say one to avoid . this place has become a russian roulette . their shell fish is dangerous . love the flavors but hate the trips to the bathroom all night . they need to do something about it before they get shut down . a real shame , i really used to love this place . 
it was more like a N . N , but i really liked the service and i had a great experience here , so why not . . . . N it is N ) bazooka guacamole- yummy ! guac with goat cheese , fried shallots and the chips were quite authentic , not the usual nasty type . very different and flavoful N ) shrimp ceviche- yummy ! super fresh , citrusy and refreshing N ) shrimp quesadilla- small-lish but good . very flavorful
this review is for service during our brunch . i get it it ' s labor day , most places will be crowded . we sat there about N mins no one came to ask for drinks and water . my friend had to ask someone to tell our waitress that we need water . i noticed other table came in after us already got their drinks and been severed , but our table still empty . fine finally our waitress showed up and she took the drinks and orders , when i told her that i might need few mins to go over the menu and choose my meal she looks very surprise , feel like she is sending me sore signal that i should be ready when she is talking the order . that ' s ok she left and after N mins someone just brought water to the table then after a while drinks arrived but not from our waitress instead someone else . i still haven ' t order yet and i was waiting when she come back but it ' s takes forever . i could have just wait on the table by myself . as i said , other table already finishing up we are just on the half way . our waitress never come by to check on us but meanwhile she was very busy serving other tables . but thanks to other waitress even she is not our waitress but she still taking care of us . i am really disappointed today during the brunch . 
all five of us had the chef ' s surprise tasting menu . it was a great surprise . we had some new york and french wines we never saw before that were very delicious and good values . service was paced very comfortably . the restaurant is very quaint and not to loud or to dark . 
i love garces ' restaurants . well i did . i still love tinto and amada . not so much a fan of this place . with the level of food and service i recieve at his other establishments , i expected a lot more out of this one . service sucked . booth where i was crammed was too small for me to fit my size N feet and long ass legs , so i had to sit sideways in the booth . food was decent ( tried tater tots , pretzels , and the burger ) . however , nothing i ' m going to write home about and rave that everyone should try . whiskey prices were outrageous . i know how much all of those bottles of scotch cost , and the mark-up of being able to buy a bottle after two pours , is outrageous . i will continue to recommend tinto and amada , but will not recommend this place . 
one of the best restaurants on the uws . it ' s gourmet southern . all of their biscuit dishes are amazing . just the right crunchiness and juicy chicken . brunch is also fantastic . the pickles portions are huge . the matzoh ball soup is also surprisingly good . the shrimp and grits is a bit too cheesy and the shrimps are served with heads on ( which is not appealing to some ) . it ' s a long wait for dinner and weekends . 
the food was good and the service was nice too . i would recommend for a quick bite , casual date , etc . can ' t go wrong with beer-battered string beans and brooklyn-style fried calamari . 
frankly i don ' t understand who writes some high reviews ! i was there couple days ago and was disappointed very high prices for that place , location , service , interior and finally food . i really don ' t understand how people can say that it is best place in brooklyn . maybe you never been in good places ? ) ) 
i absolutely love this place . i initially heard about this place from the food network and they just did a little feature on great belgian fries and this was the place . the first time i passed by , the line was huge and led out the door for a good N feet or so . this was a good indicator that this place must be good . the decor isn ' t much but it ' s quaint and conveniently located near st . mark ' s . i first visited this place with a friend we got the garlic mayo sauce . it was very good and the fries were thick cut and crisp . they fry up the wedges of potatoes to order , so the fries don ' t get stale . we went on a friday afternoon so there weren ' t that many people there , we sat down in the back of the place . there aren ' t many seats , and about two or three tables . but the tables are cute in that there are holes in the table that the pomme frites that come in paper cones will fit perfectly in there . kind of a dingy atmosphere but almost everything is wood paneled , but gives it a kind of authentic feel . i just passed by this place last week and was tempted to get some , but for me , the serving sizes are way too big . if i were to get the small sized pomme frites , i would need to share with a friend . i got a small for just myself once , and i ate about half of it and i was full . i would give this place N stars , but i just wished they also offered smaller serving sizes . if they did , i would definitely go more often . 
best nyc pizza i ' ve had . all fresh ingredients , top service ! its definitely delicious and a must try at least once . good for a date or to bring the whole family . 
the main ingredients that they use in every sultan wok sushi ( matawan , eatontown , englishtown , sayreville . . . . u name it . . . . , it is proximately N kitchenspoon of mono sodium glutamate ! ! ! ! for the " secret souce " . and when they cock the food the put another or two of mono sodium glutamate . of course i know cause it made in front my both eye ball and my nut sack . . . . . . don ' t waste ur money . . . . i wish i can give a N star rating . . . . 
lava ' s hummus is better than zahav ' s . there . i said it . previous commenters seem to really hate the table service idea . i went for dinner the other night and was very impressed by the food and the service . the menu is not extensive , but everything on it sounded like a hit . my friend and i split a red pepper stuffed with rice , veggies and figs ( absolutely delicious ) and salmon with couscous . both were perfectly cooked . both made us keep eating well beyond the point of satiety ( portions are a good size ) . the waitress was attentive without getting in the way , and at the end of the meal we were treated to a dessert from the chef . it was a semolina cake , which i think is a traditional israeli cake , and man was this thing good . it was like a cross between cornbread and pineapple upside down cake . ( ok , that description was completely inadequate . ) i can see the controversy about turning this from a cafe by day into a byo at night . maybe the chef is just trying out some stuff in preparation for opening a byo at a different location ? i don ' t know , but i for one am happy to have another byo option in the neighborhood . i just hope this isn ' t alienating otherwise loyal clientele who are now going to ocf or good karma instead . 
great place to come for a drink afterwork ! i had a g t ! really hit the spot on a hot day ! 
i generally don ' t like " vegetarian food " so it took me a long time to come around to this cafe . but the food always seems about as fresh as you can get and the hot and cold bar are always good . if you have high protein requirements you can always load up on cottage cheese , nuts and beans . they also have meat in the soups and sandwiches which are available for order . but their baked goods are always amazing ! 
buddakan , the doyenne of old city will i think be here for as long as it wants to be . with classic classics like the crispy duck salad on frisee , the black cod and the sesame crusted tuna , the ballsy drama of the room , who will let it go away ? the bento box lunch is still the best lunch bargain you can find if you ' re in the mood for asian , and they don ' t screw with it . service is great when you get one of the starr-y eyed and bushy tailed young ones who bought everything that the starr organization drill instructors threw their way , and that ' s good . if you get a vet , the service will still be pretty good . great place for a business lunch especially for those coming in from out of town . it somehow , in a very small way , gives off that new york four seasons business lunch vibe , in ramped down philly style . starr did buddakan when he was a veritable rookie , and the only guys i can think of that were that good as rookies were muhammad ali and wayne gretsky , but unlike them , starr will have a second act . 
aight mate . . . so they server strongbow . . . one of few many places in the city to know a good cider . . . jameson local beers on special are a plus but the burger . . . the burger . . . . the burger . not only did i indulge in the basic . . pyt burger . i had to go for Nnds on the tlc . i stayed away from the burger of the week to save some savoring for another visit . the owner and staff omit the air of entitlement that just says . . . im from pyt bitch . . . get used to it . . . . which kindof turned me off at first but you know what . . . i love it
i love caf cluny -- the ambiance , the location , the foods . everything i ' ve ordered there has been fantastic , even potentially boring things like a side salad the shallot sherry vinaigrette is great . want to go back ! 
nice place . very friendly and helpful waiters and has a cool vibe . food is solid . some menu items are better than others -- the lamb pops are spectacular . overall , i ' d recommend it . 
every monday i get ravioli and sauce from cuginos . their food is fresh and delicious , the store is clean and we organized , and the staff are always helpful . i recommend them for a walk in lunch of yummy sandwiches , or quick and easy take home food to prepare a fulfilling meal for the family . i really can ' t say enough wonderful things about them ! i highly recommend the ravioli ( i ' ve had them all- cheese to crabmeat ! ! ) with their vodka sauce . they always have great specials as well ! ! 
i love this place ! every time i go here , the food is delish and the service is good . this past weekend i went with a friend of mine for brunch . i had some sort of cheesy potato-y dish with eggs , and their version of a bloody mary . it was awesome . i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
we dined here N feb N , but this is the Nth or Nth year in which we ' ve dined at trattoria dell ' arte when in nyc , often more than once per year . this experience was most disappointing . what in the world has happened to the quality and service ? my wife and i had a guest , a pal and nyc attorney . all of us are lucky to dine at many fine restaurants . and all of us thought our dinners were b-a-d jumbo lump crab steak ( a nonsense dish ) , veal scaloppine piccata ( inedible according to my wife ) , and chicken parm for me ( veal chop pepperoni parmigiana ? ) which was truly awful . even though it wasn ' t crowded on a winter monday night , our waiter was constantly interrupting us to to see if we were ready to order when we ' d already told him we wanted to relax with our cocktails a bit . in exasperation we ordered . i ' d only glanced briefly at the menu , and i asked the waiter if they had chicken parmigiana . he said yes , but that they put pepperoni on it . he said it would be no problem to leave that off since i wasn ' t interested in that modification . but in looking back at their menu , i can ' t find chicken parm , so i think i was served the so called veal version . there ' s no excuse for the poor quality that we received . and there ' s no excuse for the waiter badgering us . there are more specific details that i could add , but they won ' t change the picture . maybe this place can keep making it because of their prominent location and their proximity to carnegie hall . but not if they keep serving up the stuff we got earlier this week . 
went here when i visited my friend in the area . let ' s say wayne is far from being a culinary heaven . for that reason , i think that ' s how restaurant like this stays in business . the best term i can use for this place is that they like to be pretenders . they want to go upscale from the average pizzeria , and so the menu has seafood and veal . for what you get and the level of decor , the price is a bit steep . there ' s a big rip in the bench cushion . tilapia for N . we waited a while for the food to come out , and it was just okay . nothing you can ' t get in your average diner . for all these issues that i ' m pointing out objectively we are charged in nyc prices . come on , r-e-a-l-l-y ! the only reason i ' m not giving it a N-star is because my waiter is a nice kid and he really tried . 
i was touring independence hall and the liberty bell . i wanted something a little more upscale than dairy queen so i figured i ' d pop in here for brunch . i ordered my classic bacon and over easy eggs . the service was very quick and the wait staff was nice . the food was actually pretty good . make sure to ask for butter and jam with your toast . 
i ' m from california and chinese buffet ' s are as numerous as starbucks , so it is refreshing to go into one and not have the same foods . service was good , the waitress , regardless of language limitations , was nice and friendly . food was fresh , service areas were clean and so was the dinig room . 
i have been going there for about a month . mr family of four kids and my husband and i ordered last week N N N at Npm N N we called to see why putt delivery hasn ' t arrived and when it would be coming . they said they didn ' t know they had two more deliveries ahead of us . that ' s what they said at seven . so i had my husband drive down at nine to pick it up . the food hasn ' t even been choked . then this week N N N i ordered a calzone which came completely raw dough . i called back to have a replacement sent and was told i would one , have to pick it up when the first was delivered and paid a tip . and two pay for it to be fully cooked . so i had to pay for two calzones to eat one f k that . 
what a pleasure , i went to the take out side of turks and the young girl who took my order was so polite it was refreshing to see that in these times . a smile , good food and thank you come again , is something you don ' t see any more . i ' ll go back for the food and great service . . thank you for brightening my day , good eats
came here with friends on a sunday with reservations . admittedly , my friends were a few minutes late , but the gracious host kept our table without an issue . and while i waited , i enjoyed the company of a very friendly , very talented bartender . these two , coupled with the great atmosphere , were the perks of the trip . the rest of the day fell short . service , especially drink delivery , was a bit slow and rushed . my fried chicken and waffles , which are my jam , being from the south and living close to queens comfort , fell so , so short of reviews and expectations . the mets was all dark , thigh meat and so dry , so charred . and though the menu said it was served with hot sauce , it wasn ' t even close to hot . for a thrillist top brunch place in nyc , i wasn ' t thrilled . 
probably one of the best if not the best meal i ' ve had in philadelphia . better plan your reservation in advance because seats fill up weeks in advance and for good reason ! small place with simple , comfortable decor . friendly , attentive service . we were seated promptly , every dish was explained , silverware always replaced , waiter always checked in and asked how our food was . the chef came out to shake our hands and chat a bit ( which he did with every table ) . what a treat ! ! ! so friendly ! if you ' re willing to spend , definitely go for the chef ' s tasting menu ! N well spent ! ! ! you get half the menu and too much food ! ! ! soupe- wow ! how interesting ! light and complex . the sweetness from the tomato jam added such a nice layer of flavor . pheasant pate was very good . nice pistachio notes that went well with the date mustard . duo de foie gras seared was absolutely amazing . melt in your mouth ! also great fall flavors . my favorite ! sandre saut ed walleye pike was perfectly cooked . nice crisp skin . i loved the grape with it ! the sage milk emulsion really brought it all together . bone marrow was delicious ! rich . garlicky . flavorful . bread crumbs soaked in delicious oil ! rabbit leg was very good . the white bean and rabbit sauce was great ! tender rabbit leg . the flan was very smooth . went well with the fresh fruit . the floating island-- some sort of goat cheese with praline crunch heaven ! ! ! i could have had N if i wasn ' t full N plates ago . french press coffee was perfect ending and needed with all the rich food . oh , table bread was also nice and fresh ! can ' t beat a byo ! cannot wait for my next visit ) update crab and tomatoes bisque . i could drown in it . fois gras- still the champ ! escargot was plump , earthy and delicious . mahi tuna tartar was so fresh ! striped bass was flakey . great wine sauce with mushrooms and broccoli ! yum ! duck confit was insanely tender and delicous . love the picked cabbage and sauce . covina fillet- the sauce was amazing . floating island still my fav dessert . hazelnut souffl was silky and a cold souffl ! pineapple tart , good but want wild about the tart part . always great service . 
wow ! ! i haven ' t had real thai food in over a decade ! this was amazing ! and when they say spicy they mean real spicy not like most restaurants i ' ve tried that felt like it was just salty . i started with the baby back ribs . apparently they know their ribs . it fell off the bone with yummy salty sweet sauce . then i had the krabi seafood noodles . . it really isn ' t recommended for beginners . totally loved it . had a jasmine tea and ended with their tapioca dessert with pumpkin and coconut . they have a pretty big bathroom for such a cozy restaurant . not as small as nook but maybe twice the size of that . cute and fairly well aerated for a thai restaurant . it is tight spacing like most new york restaurants but its so worth it . i didn ' t expect it to be that good since it was midtown . definitely coming back for more ! ! ! ! 
the only panamanian restaurant i ' ve ever been to in nyc . contrary to the stereotypes , not all panamanian food is composed of tails and feet , though some people may find some of the cuts of meat in some dishes questionable . anyway , kelso is fantastic , and a great deal as well . the vast majority of the entrees , and all of the soups , are under N , and these are reasonably large portions . the appetizers are cheap too , most of them are N- N . the braised pork with plantains and the chicken stew are both excellent . the empanadas are delicious and they serve sorrel ! recommended . 
this place has been around for quite sometime . owner and chef billy grant has made landmark in west hftd center . bar menu is great . always a happy hour specials . menu is well diverse from americana to rustic italian . staff is hit or miss for personalities . nice wine selection , very few local brews , but top shelf always . be prepared to wait , has outside dining , bring your wallet . has sister store bricco trattoria in glastonbury . 
this is a mixed review . i agree with most of what other reviewers have noted about this place . when it first opened , i was a fan . the staff was french and they tried to make the restaurant decor feel authentically french , which was nice . in any case , i was compelled to continue to frequent this place to help support a restaurant in my neighborhood . however , i went there recently on a busy night and it was the worst experience . first , the staff was so flustered that the quality of the service and the food suffered as a result . they were all running around like headless chickens and the food was late and cold . i was there with family visiting nyc and it was a complete nightmare . and whatever you do - when they ask how things are don ' t feel inclined to give an honest response . they don ' t take criticism well . i don ' t think i will be going to this place again - certainly not on a busy restaurant night . a tuesday afternoon may be okay and manageable for the staff . 
i thought about this place only because i actually wanted to try the lobster rolls over at a lobster place in redhook . so while having a friend wait almost N mins for me to arrive , we easily got a table on a sunday night . i absolute had to try the lobster roll because i haven ' t been to maine yet . i also ordered N oysters , N yamamuto ( spelling ? ) and N malpeque ( spelling ? ) the lobster roll was well seasoned except that it had way too many niblets of celery , which was a tad too strong to enjoy the lobster . i took a couple of pieces of my friends string beans and they were amazing . at first glance , they appeared to be overly doused in garlic . the ending was the N pieces ( i only had N on my plate and after further inquiry , our waitress returned with the Nth ) of raw oysters at N a pop . i slurped , yes slurped the first N malpeque pieces and wth ? ? , where did they go ? they were sooo thin that i couldn ' t even believe i swallowed them . thank goodness the yamamuto were delicious . thicker , bigger , and fresh . btw i did like the mild spicy vinegar dipping sauce for the oyster very much . i must return for the all you can eat oysters ! ! 
food is pretty okay , with a mediocre pricing . one thing i don ' t like much is the service . servers don ' t look friendly even when you are ordering food or tipping . they will only split the bill evenly , otherwise you have to pay cash . 
yakitori boy is awesome ! i went with N of my closest friends and we had a great time ordering different things throughout the evening and enjoy sake and sapporo beers . you have to get the chicken skin skewers . . . they ' re like crackcicles . it ' s really not like i can say the food was outstanding or their are any specialty drinks that you have to get , but i will say the overall vibe you get inside yakitori combined with the intriguing menu options and the quality of the service really made me feel like this is going to be a good place for me to bring small groups of my friends . 
my wife and i decided to try this pizza yesterday spot after receiving a zagat saying this was the best pizza in new york . i will give you the full fair run-down so you don ' t waste your time and money . first lets talk about d cor . . . the place is very tiny , if you think you will enjoy a pizza with your spouse , girlfriend boyfriend . . . . fughetaboutit ! i think only about N people could sit down at this dive , plus you would be facing a wall sitting cafeteria style bunched up like a sardine , with customers breathing on your pizza while you eat or standing over you . we decided to order a pizza and eat it in our car . next up service . . . so when you order a pizza N slice , N pie , N for classic pie , you have to let the order taker know what you want . in our case it was a guy , ( maybe the owner son ) but he takes your order on yellow tab paper and you become like a box on a crossword puzzle . you would think with this system , it would be first come first served , but it is not . although the order taker told us about a N min wait , we happily waited to taste why this pizza was so good . anyway , my wife and i have never been to this pizza joint before but as we were waiting , we started to notice that the order taker was switching boxes with orders . yep , what i mean is that if you were a regular and you came in after someone else , your pizza came out before the person ahead of you . we both assumed that some of these people may have called in an order , although we heard no phones ringing , and no pizzas waiting for pickup . after we had been waiting for about N mins a family can in and placed their order . . . you guessed it they got their pizza Nbout N mins before me . the gentleman said it was his first time at di fara . hmmmm . finally hows the food ? well my rating tell it all . frank pepe in new haven ct is by far the best tasting pizza ! but let me share with you why you may want to save your N herd earned bucks ! the place is nasty in terms of being sanitary . the health grade is still pending wich means for a location that has been there that long they must consistently get below an " a " grade . this is what we saw on saturday november Nnd N . . . the same guy who is taking orders with a dirty pen and pad , is the same person handling the money . cash is one of the filthiest things you can touch because its full of germs . but here is where it gets nasty . . . yep , the same guy who is touching all those dollar bills , is also going to the back and replenishing the dough ( two or three at a time ) for the old man to make the pies . oh yeah , no gloves , he ' s touching the dough with bare dirty , nasty hands . also , the same guy that touches the money , and the dough , is reaching his filthy hands into the cheese been and grating the cheese . now about the pizza , when we finally got it about N mins later it was a disgrace to true pizza lovers ! we tried the classic ( sausage , peppers , onions , mushrooms ) and the toppings were almost non existent . the pizza was to soggy at the ends ( your crucial first bite will flop over ) and the ends were to hard . ( because its a thin crust ) the ends were not chewy at all . also , if you like gooey , cheesy pizza , ( the kind when you pick up a slice the cheese is all over ) then don ' t go here . they use tree different kinds of cheese and they are lacking on the mozzarella . the sauce did not hold up either as it was pushed to the end of the hard crust ! bottom line . . . save your money , this place is overrated ! 
best tacos i ' ve had outside of mexico ( where i lived for N years ) . i went twice and twice i got the carne asada taco with pico de gallo and some salsa verde . really delicous . prices not so much ( N for one taco--you can get about N tacos in mexico for that kinda money and maybe a soda too ) . the place is tiny so it ' s kinda hard to get a table , and even harder if a hipster pretentious guy tells you , " you can ' t seat until you have your food . it ' s the unspoken rule . " but guess what ? he didn ' t have his food either ! ! ! so if i see you there again , i ' ll poke your eyes through your lens-less glasses . bitch . phew . had to let it out . so in short go here for a quick , yummy , and a bit pricey bite . 
are you kidding me ? i really don ' t get the hype on this place . my husband and i are vegetarians . our first clue that firebox would be disappointing should have been when we determined there was only one vegetarian dish on the entire " farm to table " menu . in spite of that , we gave it a try . we both order the chickpea gnocci , which is the most expensive dish on the menu . we were served a N pile of flavorless mush covered with steamed vegetables . the vegetables made it look pretty but the gnocci was just awful . i started with a kale salad and my husband started with the market salad . both were good but it ' s hard to screw up a salad . we went with another couple who are carnivores . one ordered mussels with a side of greens and was underimpressed . the other ordered a pork dish . apparently the pork dish was good but not worth the asking price . for dessert i order the strawberry shortcake . the strawberries didn ' t look fresh even though i went in the middle of june , prime strawberry season . the cake was ok and the sabayon was flavorless and very disappointing . my husband had the smore . the marshmellow was delicious as was the ice cream but the cake was disappointing . on the positive side the food is presented nicely , the waitstaff is very friendly ( albeit slow ) , the space itself if absolutely beautiful and the bread was fantastic - but is made offsite , i belive by the hartford baking company . for me this place is all hype . i expected spectacular flavor from fresh ingredients . what i got was subpar food at ridiculous prices . if you like to overpay , this is the place for you . 
i guess it ' s a cool place for a date during the winter if you like the basement sorta thing . i wasn ' t woo ' ed even by their cheese- i like murray ' s cheese bar better . the kale and pepper mac and cheese was fine , surprisingly not so flavorful as i expected and wanted ! they sat our group of N next to a two party on the corner - odd seating , and loud environment for a wednesday night . 
i dined at dragonfly with my boyfriend a few days ago . we were happy to find out that they had live jazz in their bar area which could be heard throughout the restaurant . they had a nice menu with a lot of great choices and a very creative drink list . we split a yummy bottle of sauvignon blanc for N which is really affordable for a restaurant . i had the crab topped salmon which was recommended by our waitress and loved it ! my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and was impressed by the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked . for dessert we split the fried cheesecake with ice cream and thoroughly enjoyed it . the atmosphere was lovely with different pieces of interesting decor throughout . the fish tank which was lit blue was cool looking although it needed some more fish for such a large tank . great new spot , we ' ll be back again . 
nyonya hit the spot ! i had gotten an hour massage earlier in the afternoon , so i was dehydrated- and already getting sore- come dinner . that said , i started my meal with fresh coconut juice , served in a shaved coconut , and it was exactly what i needed ! my friend and i then continued with shares of the steamed spring rolls , the lemongrass seafood stew with rice noodles , and the sauteed shrimp with vegetables , and everything was delicious . the spring rolls and the stew were particularly tasty , and together were filling enough that we could have done without the shrimp but we ate it all , regardless ! 
what a charming spot . stopped by for brunch this weekend and the place was already packed by N ( it ' s a small place and best to come w N - N people ) . i had the sashimi zuke don . absolutely delicious with marinated salmon , ikura , avocado , shredded seaweed and eggs . my kind of breakfast bowl ! the banana nutella croissant . get that as a dessert . buttery flakey croissant with nutella oozing out of it . cannot go wrong . it ' s also built around a tree . feels like you ' re dining inside a treehouse . 
went this past friday and had a table for five . was told before we ordered our three beers that there was a N minute " freeze " on drinks and they we would have to wait for beer . whatever . then we got our beers - one five minutes later , one ten minutes later , and the last easily N minutes later . layout is terrible with no separation between bar and restaurant resulting in a ridiculously loud and cramped experience . food is overpriced and sub-par ( N for skimpy serving of irish nachos with cheese ) . was pretty excited to try this place out but was definitely disappointed . looks like i ' ll be sticking to the half door and corner pug . 
food is okay . drinks and okay . service very good ! very fun atmosphere when you get upstairs ! tuesday nights are best ! overall experience very good ! 
authentic ecuadorian food . the " caldo de bolas " has that " manabita " touch . i thought i had eaten the best in ecuador , this one equals it . 
the food was fantastic , the service great and i would recommend to everyone , the stuffed shrimp with crabmeat , the sole , the vodka pasta , and the appys were to die for , the keylime pie was my fav dessert and the isce tea with pear and cinnamon i want a gallon of ! ! N stars . . . . . . 
great dim sum and amazing chinese . the pad thai is not thai . . went there with a big group ( N people ) ordered a lot of food and wine ( big bill on a tuesday ) . had brought cupcakes for dessert for birthday . they charged about N . N each person to put the cupcakes on a plate which we thought was really tacky . 
tough review to write . i love the burgers but i hardly ever go for one reason terrible ventilation . not only is it hard to breathe in there sometimes , i always end up reeking like meat . i went a few nights ago and my bedroom , the entire bedroom smelled plus , my coat still smells . i could easily say it ' s one of the best burgers i have ever had but lack of air is nuts ! i wish they ' d fix the problem , i ' d probably visit every week instaed of every couple months . 
what a fabulous restaurant ! ! ! we had wonderful vegetarian food that was seasoned to absolute perfection . the food had a slight hint of a caribbean influence which made me savor each and every bite . the staff was so welcoming and nice . i loved it from the moment i walked in and was served water with lemon and cucumber in a ball jar . the food is very reasonably priced and it is a byob . i could tell they put much heart and soul into every detail of the dining experience . the live music only added to the great laid back ambiance . i also loved hearing some bob marley tunes when the live music was done for the evening . i highly recommend this new place in town ! ! ! ! peace , love and vital ! ps- can ' t wait to go back ! ! ! 
very good , fresh and large portions . small restaurant , may have to wait , but worth it . 
i strongly disagree with the other reviews of marzullos . my family and i are long time customers of the restaurant and have never had any problems . the wait staff have always been extremely friendly and curtious . the food has never been anything below excellent and it almost seems these reviews are jokes . only makes me wonder what your true motives are for leaving these negative reviews . my family and i go there at least once a week and find the prices and food portions to be amazing . . an a in my book . 
it takes forever to get into the place . we had to make reservations a few weeks in advance ! once we finally got in , the food was relatively good and not too expensive . the sangria was also amazing . the service was a little on the slow side but if you don ' t have somewhere to be afterwards it ' s not a problem . 
this place used to be awesome . i went to their new place and i was super disappointed . the fun vibe and the sangria bar is gone . yes they will serve unlimited sangria but its just not the same . the food has also gone done . the burrito used to the size of a chipolte burrito and now its more like the size of a tamale and not as tastey . why fix something if its not broken ? used to be my favorite brunch spot but i wont go back ( 
lack of flavor and poor service . heavy on the salt and low on the spice . tried a couple standards - rogan josh and chicken curry - and we were left unfulfilled . at least the naan was hot and fresh . 
stop . using . truffle . oil . 
if you want impeccable service , food cooked to perfection , soothing background music , white tablecloths , a crackling fire and beautiful italian surroundings , then you will find it as we did at lu nello . the food was fresh and served at just the right temperature which is so important to me . this place is upscale , but you don ' t have to wear your diamonds . it was lunchtime and very cold outside so what could be better than lamb stew ? it was divine . there is also a cozy little bar when you walk in bathed in rich dark woods and italian men in suits and ties . loved it . 
i ' ve checked out hawthornes off and on since they opened last year . and i had hoped it would get better - it hasn ' t . i know nothing about the food here , so i won ' t comment on that - i am a beer guy , and hawthornes makes itself hard to like . it is certainly the most expensive bottle shop in the city , which doesn ' t make much sense - considering the location and relations to bella vista . the selection is ok - but skews very heavily to the bella vista family of beers - seemingly to the detriment of the other great beers and breweries we can get in the philadelphia region . the growler concept again would be fantastic - if the prices were anywhere near reality - and what ' s with the glass price - aren ' t those things like N everywhere else that has ever sold them . finally , it ' s the attitude towards the beer that gets me more than anything else - a certain arrogance not to expose a new craft beer drinker to great beer - but to rip them off at every opportunity - this is not the spirit of american craft beer . so , go to the foodery , go to brew , and go to food and friends to buy great beer - they embrace the craft beer ethos and embrace the customer , alike . 
good burger and great truffle fries . a little empty for a weeknight . 
great food ! very friendly . came back twice and will come back again when in the area . 
meh . the chicken and chive was pretty good ( i was pleasantly surprised how much chive there was ) , but the walnut shrimp was just terrible . first of all , it cost N or so and was tiny . instead of rolling the shrimp in the sauce , they drizzled the sauce over it . i guess it keeps the shrimp more crispy , but there wasn ' t enough sauce to actually flavor the shrimp properly ( i . e . it was just dry and bland ) . what disappointed me even more though , was how small the portion was and how small the actual shrimp more . maybe they fixed it since last time i ate there , but i just felt ripped off . general observations quality for most dishes is slightly below that of a good chinatown restaurant . portion size is much smaller . price is around the same to slightly higher . extra points for being nice looking . 
after having lived in mexico for a few months in high school , i know what authentic mexican food tastes like . taco riendo is as authentic as it gets . fresh ingredients , simple meals , filling but not grotesquely large portions , and plenty of the good stuff ( not just fillers like rice ) are trademarks of this little restaurant located in the kensington area of philly . perhaps one of my favorite aspects about taco riendo is the atmosphere . it always smells delightful inside the little dining area ( where you can watch your meal being prepared and cooked in an extremely clean kitchen ) , and the decor looks like it all comes straight from mexico . . . no keetchy fake mexican decorations . the prices are extremely reasonable , tacos are about N-N for N soft tortillas and filling that ranges from the expected ( chorizo ) to the unique ( white fish with pineapple and spicy salsa ) . and entrees range from about N -N at most . my food recommendations are enchiladas verdes ! ! ! these enchiladas are incredible . i have gotten them the last N times i have gone to tr . moist chicken marinated and cooked in the salsa verde then rolled into corn tortillas and smothered in rich yet light and spicy green sauce and covered with cool " mexican cheese " which may be oaxacan cheese . side of herbed yellow rice and spicy blackbeans . amazing nom nom nom . chorizo burrito quite simply , stuffed to bursting with spicy sauteed peppers , onions , lettuce , tomato , beans , mexican rice , and plenty of chorizo . dipping sauce is a smoky red salsa that definitely fires up your senses . so filling you might need to skip breakfast the next day ) i ' m not sure what this one is called , but during the winter i always get a stew of pollo and calabasitas , basically chicken stew with zucchinni , potatoes , onion and a savory thick sauce that is both spicy and rich . incredible . perfect comfort food to stave off frostbitten fingertips and the frozen nose so characteristic of the windy philly winters . y por fin , mexican coffee ! no matter what time of year you must try this . spicy and sweet and full of cinnamon and other unknowns this coffee is sure to delight . no cream needed . . . that would spoil the goodness . be sure to ask the lovely lady at the cash register if they ' re brewing it before you leave . sometimes they will even boil a pot up specially if you look desperate . oh ! almost forgot ! this is a byob ! so bring your brews and relax in this chill , friendly , freakin delicious environment . 
i love this place and the happy hour draft prices ! the food is just ok , but a N N price draft beer until N pm definitely makes me happy . 
not so much . . . went there with N friends and will not be returning . . food was just ok . . service was fine , however . . . after spending about N . N on our check , the manager came over , asked how everything was , and proceeded to say that we were sitting at our table a bit too long and he needed it for another party , so please pay the check and get out . . ( not exactly in those words , but pretty close ) we were appalled to say the least . . what happened to customer service ? ? ? oh there was none . . go figure . i will not be back . . if i want great greek food , i will head to zorba ' s in fairmount ! ! 
i went after a quite sometime , and they have added a few more new items on the menu and prices have been very competitively named . i ordered kothuparotta mutton chukka . really good delicacies . 
after a really long wait , i finally got seated , and had the excitement of ordering my first denino ' s pizza . i ' ve heard a lot about it . . . . best pizza on staten island is what some people say . i ' d have to say , it was pretty great . there was nothing bad about the pizza . every aspect of it was well done . but i don ' t think there was anything truly special about its pizza either . there wasn ' t anything not to like , but there wasn ' t anything to really fall in love with either . if you ever have the urge for a great pizza and don ' t want to be disappointed , this is the place for you . if you are a tourist , or someone interested in getting a feel for staten island pizza , i highly suggest you go . 
i recently went to the continental midtown location and i have to say it is one of my favorite places in the city for a fun evening out . the food is always spot on and the drinks are always fantastic . i went in after work one night a couple of weeks ago and just had dinner at the bar . my bartender anna was fantastic . she was fun and bubbley and full of energy . i asked her what she would recommend , i was looking to try something refreshing and light . so she made me a drink with st germaine and it was amazing . i would recommend this place any day of the week . 
my favorite food cart in new haven . the vermicelli is super delicious and healthy . hands down one of the best things i ' ve ever ate . the owner of the cart is so nice . i remember the first time i ordered from the cart , there was this lady in front of me whose daughter had peanut allergies , so she came back with her order which contained peanuts , and asked the owner if he could just give her some rice and salad . the owner instead said he ' ll make her another one , free of charge , even though the lady was already a dollar short on her original order . five stars for good food and good heart . 
wow , overrated . we went here once for a birthday celebration . we heard amazing things about the place and we left feeling we could have had a better meal at the olive garden ( how sad ) . the food was lacking flavor , the wait stuff was awful , could not get a hold of people , we had a party of N , and felt we were totally ignored . the waiter actually spilled sauce on me while cleaning up and to top it off , they did not have the scotch i wanted . not sure why this place is rated as high as it is , but the ambiance is nice . 
from the outside , continental looks like a regular , sorta-N ' s style diner . on the inside , i was surprised by how classy and upscale it appeared . the brunch menu was short , but had all the essentials , from seasonal pumpkin waffles to lobster mac cheese to hearty sandwiches . i ordered the eggs benedict with canadian bacon , side of potatoes , and wheat toast . i have to say , the eggs benedict was to die for ! i ate there about N hours ago , and i ' m still thinking about them and wishing i could eat there now . the egg yolk was runny , so if that ' s not your thing , ask for them a bit more cooked . the seating choices are great . you can choose to sit outside , at a booth , or upstairs in a hanging basket seat . since i ' m only N ' N , the basket seats were a little far from the table for my liking , but it did not detract from the meal . and , it ' s fun to swing around a bit in them before and after eating . at N for a brunch for two , i cannot recommend this place enough . the entrees run a bit more expensive , but the breakfast prices were more than reasonable for the portions and taste . i can ' t wait to go back ! 
i am a big fan of thai and this restaurant definitely stayed true to the fresh flavors that make the cuisine so good . fish and chicken were both tender and well prepared . the thing is the food had no oomph . wonton soup looked great bit the base was too sweet . same with the pan seared tilapia meal . i ate it all but couldn ' t savor it the way i ' ve had thai at other restaurants . 
i cannot rave enough about this place . i love italian food and this is absolutely a hidden gem in south philly . the staff is welcoming , friendly and will even give you left over wine from other patrons that left them . ohh , it ' s byob so that ' s a major plus . every item i have ordered here has been amazing from calamari to the main course is divine . it ' s a must try but you may have to wait but it ' s so worth it . 
after N . N of take out from here tonight i think i ' m qualified to rate this place . i have to disagree withother other reviews . the food is nothing to brag about . i take review very seriously and critically bc others count on opinion . when someone says hands down or best kept secret or to die for they shud reallymean it . i am a food and rest . junkie and yhat goes for fast food as well . so here we go soups very good . eggs rolls good . panfried wontons rubbery not crispy . seasame chic w white meat rubbery not to much flavor . chic broc very good with great flavor . pepper steak and onion good flavor but quality of meat cud have been better . . shredded pork and string beans stunk . far far far from what shredded actually means . boneless spare rib tips stunk too extremely dry . pork fried rice and nooble very dark in color , oily . over all this place is ok . i wudnt order from again but continue my quest . my favorite is chengd kitchen in woodbridge but they dont take credit cards so i relied on yelp for help . i hope this helps . . even for fast food this place is seriously just average . 
friendly staff and good tasting food . accepted yelp deal with no problem . serves efes beer which is a hard find even in ny . save room for the warm cheese filled dessert . 
its good but sometimes too greasy for me . you have to try it at least one time . the food is consistent . 
we were excited to try la sirene after reading many of their reviews but were utterly disappointed at the end . their bread is cold and served with hard butter . we had the goat cheese tart and the onion soup for appetizers . the goat cheese tart was very good but was the only enjoyable thing for the rest of the meal , and that is despite the burned tart crust . the onion soup used a very simple cheese for the top , not traditional french at all . we shared the lamb for an entree and found the meat to be tough . our dessert , their isle flotant , was mediocre . certainly not the type we would order again . overall it was an overpriced meal for the experience we had , we shall not be back . 
the foods amazing . the service is laughable . don ' t come for the service . come for the food . gumbo was incredible and had a serious kick . i loved the red beans and rice , but my " i ' m-way-more-cajun-than-you " friend insisted they weren ' t all that and a bag of chips . we also had some sort of crab and pork meatball po ' boy , which to me was really more like a swagged out bahn mi , but was pretty great as well . i ' ll definitely go back for the chicken biscuit and a few other snacks again just bring some good company and drink a lot because you ' ll be ignored by the staff ( table full of dishes , not enough silverware for N people to eat like humans , basic shit like that ) . 
loved the pizza , loved the service . coming from princeton where there are numerous decent pizza places , we were skeptical , but were bowled over after our first visit . the ingredients are so fresh you can taste every one of them . this is going to be one of our regular . 
i have been coming to this restaurant for five years and i have come to enjoy sitting outside and watching the most beautiful woman in the city pass by , while enjoying a glass of wine and a delicious meal . the owner whom i have gotten to know is a warm and personable man . i recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves to sit back in a relaxed atmosphere and watch the world go by . 
solid food . the sangria was amazing as was the corn , you have to get the corn ! ! ! 
bbq pork papaya salad huge portion , refreshing and very spicy however , the pork was tough . moo larb delicious , the best dish we ordered . crispy pork with morning glory the pork was old . it came literally N seconds after we ordered it , which is not ok . overall , i would go back to taste other dishes , even though the quality of the pork they gave us was mediocre in two dishes . 
not really sure how it gets its reputation unless other nyc ramen shops suck . i come from seattle where we have us branches of N major japanese ramen chains along with our own home grown chains , and ippudo simply doesn ' t measure up with the best . i had the current chef special cha cha cha which came with too high of a noodle to broth ratio and minimal ingredients ( couple slices of pork and cabbage with a little bonito flakes ) . it was all just ok . the pork buns are very nice . given just ok food and long wait times and high prices , ippudo may well be one of the best of nyc for locals , but for visitors of the city from places with lots of great ramen choices like seattle or la ippudo is not a destination restaurant . 
a new favorite . we ' ve been N times and each time the experience was delightful . the design of the restaurant is beautiful so immediately on walking in , it feels good . there is a very welcoming vibe , which is so important . the cocktail list is great . . hard to choose so we ' ve started working our way through it . excellent beer list and an interesting , well-thought- out wine list . the menu is simple but elegant and earthy . . a list of amazing antipasto that one can combine as one desires . we particularly love the rapini , genoa salami , olive , fior de latte , speck and oh hell . . . it ' s all perfect . comes on a big plate drizzled with delicate , soft olive oil and soft , salty bread . a meal in itself . arguably this joint has the best caesar salad in town . loaded with flavor , crispy romaine , gorgeous anchovies and lots of finely grated cheese . perfect . the choices of pizze are varied and each better than the next . neapolitan in style with tomato , mozzarella and a beautiful , wheat-y dough straight from the flaming hot oven . i won ' t bother making any particular suggestion for pizze choice . . its meaningless . delish is all i can say . okay . the rucola is my favorite and the margherita is favored by our son . the service is professional , casual , attentive and consistently spot-on . nice job by all . . so glad they ' re here . 
horrible place . i had tummy problems after having dinner there . arrogant service and lifeless food . another overpriced meatpacking place . 
the diner never gets your order right never cooked right or sent raw the hostess never gives you the right order either and very rude stay away go to tops diner best food around
we love this place ! good italian food and pizza at a reasonable price . nothing overly fancy , just good quality and tasty food . always good service , too . we usually get a pizza which is not too doughy like some places , although it is not a real thin crust either . the early bird pasta specials start at N . N if you arrive before N , and we get those a lot too . it is a byob restaurant . haven ' t done the take out , but i would expect the same good quality . 
good beer selection , beautiful fish tanks behind the bar gives them distinctive atmosphere . they have really good bar food , fastfood style ( you order at the window ) . schnitzel burger or fried cram burger are so good you must try--all under N . also note that they have the most awesome backyard in the neighborhood ! 
great food ! delicious and the place has a great feel to it . something different to eat other than the usual boring places . love it ! tacos love
great vibe , food and cocktails . the charcuterie plates are especially recommended . 
great service , great beer selection . bartenders are always awesome and willing to recommend and give tastes if you ' re unsure what you want . a bit out of the way , next to the queensboro bridge , but worth the walk out . selection of beers is unique , and rotates fairly often . they do offer happy hour on select beers , but try something you can ' t find elsewhere . not a big place . bar area is tight , tho i ' ve been able to grab a seat after work without a problem . more table and outdoor seating available in the back , which is great during the summer . a must try for a beer snob ! 
great food , environment , and personality . i had the artichokes , the pork with fennel and citrus , and the creme brulee . the artichokes were superb . the pork was stunning ! the creme brulee was delightful . my waiter was pleasant and always available . up until this restaurant i thought tapas could not get better than a specific restaurant that i adore in my home town ( and is well-renowned in its own right ) . amada made that restaurant look like taco bell . absolutely worth the money . way better than ( and not as expensive as ) buddakan , which is right down the street . 
cozy home cooked french bistro is how i would describe tartine , from the tiny dinning area with little pictures hung with care to the little tables all cramped indoors , it seems to me like a little old lady opened her home to people to eat in . perfect place for sunday brunch but when i went to tartine ' s it was pretty late in the afternoon right after the sunset so our pictures are not as good as i had hope . but don ' t let the pictures fool ya , all N dishes we ordered were great and the added bonus was byob . this time i went for something i have yet to try in my life , escargot ( N ) being one of them , i got that as my main entre , sharlene got the sausage cooked in mustard vinaigrette with roasted potatoes ( N ) and as our starters fig salad ( N ) . the tiny little snails were great they were stewed in butter with minced parsley and garlic that were to die for and could have eaten more of i think my order only came with N-N ( no wonder those french women stay so slim ) and the fig salad were more bountiful but only came with N figs only , it was ripe and very sweet on a bed a frise and balsamic vinaigrette . a little over dressed but not bad at all , and sharlene ' s pork sausage was great never had them cooked like this before . i guess it is typical french , and the feeling of dinning outdoors while the cool fall air wafting by us with the hint of smoky aroma of our red wine really warm me up . more like N . N stars - the food is good , but not amazingly good . 
i was lucky enough to go to the secret supper club on a thursday night . we had the january tasting menu which included a white bean dip , smoked trout , chicken and dumplings , cheese , and a mini bourbon bacon chipwich . everything was really good . i particularly enjoyed the chicken and dumplings . the service was impeccable . we had a few people with dietary restrictions which was addressed as soon as we sat down , and everyone ' s concerns were handled . they offer a N wine pairing , but i ended up splitting a bottle of red . i definitely want to go back for more cheese and to try some of the lunch options . 
we always skipped this place in favor of the other local asian resturants , but we decided to try it out this saturday night . . . we were seated immediately . the service was amazing , they were on top of everything , and available whenever you needed them , even topping off my beer glass regularly . the food was also great , the menu accommodated our different eating styles . my fiance had miso soup that she said was great , and then two specialty rolls which were also very good . i went with the sesame white meat chicken , which was one of the best i ' ve ever had . the decor was very appealing , and the whole restaurant was noticeably clean . prices were very reasonable as well , spent less here than the other local asian restaurants . will definitely go back . 
i ordered two pies for take out and spent N . N . the bottom of both pies were burnt . they were not edible . i called and told them about it but they didn ' t really seem to care . they did not offer to remake the pies . usually the pies are very good but with their attitude and customer service , i don ' t think i will be returning . if you order take out make sure you check and see if the bottoms are burnt . this place is very popular so don ' t be intimidated by the long lines . make sure you get what you paid for . 
a group of N of us went to kelly ' s for dinner over the weekend . we were surprised to see how busy the place was being that they are fairly new . we shared some apps , the quesadilla , spring rolls and coconut shrimp . all very good and the quesadilla was huge ! the wait staff was friendly and attentive but not smothering . we all had something different for our meal and we all left with doggie bags . portions are really great and so is the price . i will be back again for sure . 
was a great experience . the food was great and im glad no gmos were present . 
this is most amazing french restaurant i have ever been to -- including my travels through france ! i was only in philadelphia for a couple of nights for a conference , and i ' m so glad that i stumbled upon this gem . if you ' re looking for a high-class , perfect service and dining experience , then this is the place for you . they brought a lovely basket of fresh , soft ( and crusty ! ) bread selection -- my favorite being the berry and nut bread . i ordered the beef bourguinon and my taste buds rejoiced . the lovely gar on suggested a burgundy wine that perfectly matched the dish . my fellow diners ordered the scallops and the lamb -- both finished their plates . . . and nearly licked them clean ! although the portions were perfect , we couldn ' t resist the dessert menu . the apple tart was the best i ' ve ever had ( we swapped the ice cream for some thick whipped cream ) with a crisp and caramelized pastry and flavorful apples with a perfect bite ( no apple mush ! ) . we also concocted a lovely dessert coffee cappuccino with pear liquor . oh . . . my . . . lord . this wasn ' t an inexpensive outing , but the quality was unbeatable . hats off to the friendly and accommodating staff ! will definitely visit here again next time i ' m in town . for now , i will be dreaming about this meal ) 
delivery sucks
best . ramen . ever . if i could i would eat this everyday , but the wait is rather long . no matter when you go , there is always a wait . the longest i have waited is an hour and half but it ' s so worth it . it ' s soo goodd . the tuna appetizer is really amazing as well . there is a N or so pepper labeled ramen . it ' s really not that spicy . but it ' s really good . 
the great wazu has a great central location , and it is all around perfect . . . some key facts in rating this place a five star . . . efficiency - N-minutes or less wait no matter what time you arrive - hot or cold sub , - plenty of employees , and - the coolers and shelves are always stocked to the gills . . . premium ingredients - boar ' s head , - herr ' s , - cocacola products , - fresh lemonade , - housemade dressings , etc . speciality menu - boar ' s head combinations you should pay extra for ! - at least N different italian mixes , - innovative panini and hard roll sandwishes , - every hot subs imaginable , etc . and the tuna ! ! ! - oh my friends . . . the tuna . my lord , please tell me what ' s in it . get it on wheat . . . get it on a hard roll . . . get it on a melt . or my favorite . . . the tuna chef . there are no vegetables , or crunchy surprises . . . it ' s plain and simply divine . it ' s just a great place to be . . . thanks wazu . 
food i ordered a cheesesteak wit whiz . they have plenty of signs on their walls to tell you how to order . order your cheesesteak at the first window and drinks at the second one . the beef was pretty tender and tasted good with onions and whiz . the bread was also decent . service if you followed their instructions , everything should be fine and work like clockwork . the order came out quickly . no muss , no fuss . location definitely had that tourist trap feel . but between the cross street rivalry , i ' d pick pat ' s over geno ' s any day . 
ah , little italy pizza . . . i used to live nearby and it was a regular source of many meals . it ' s not one of those pizzerias that will ever have a legendary reputation or achieve cult status but i think it ' s definitely one the best pizza places in philly . i ' ve had a large number of their menu items ( entrees , pasta dishes , salads , apps , etc . ) and i ' ve always been very pleased . i can honestly say , as someone who has ordered delivery from lip probably a hundred times if not more , i ' ve never had any problem with delivery whatsoever . in my personal experience , delivery has always been prompt and accurate . maybe my proximity played into that success rate , i don ' t know . i just wanted to put that out there since a lot of folks are dinging them on delivery . 
maybe this is unfair , but i was in nyc on vacation . i wanted the best halo halo and i heard this was the place . i walked the area and showed up at about N N . walked in and told them i was looking for the best halo halo in nyc and wanted to get it to go . i was told that thy didn ' t open till N and didn ' t make things to go , but i was free to come back then . hmmm , the restaurant business is a tough gig and you would think they would want my business . maybe not , so i will find halo somewhere else . it is a shame , sounds like people like this place . i would have liked the chance to have that experience ! 
i ' ve heard wonderful things about this place , but didn ' t experience the same ! ! was there for lunch today , delayed waitstaff n sandwich order took N minutes to arrive , oh and waitress delivered two of the sandwiches without fries . . . . said they were on there way , lol ! ! rec ' d the original bill with a discount but when they ran cc the bill didn ' t have a discount . . . no time to dispute it due to delays ! ! i will say the N N sandwich that i was to able to inhale was fairly decent ! ! not sure i ' ll go back ! ! 
i ' ve eaten at the buffet and ordered from the menu and the food is always wonderful . each dish is carefully prepared and beautifully presented . although both northern and southern indian dishes are served , the specialty seems to be southern indian , so there are many different types of dosa . if you want to introduce someone to indian food , and they don ' t think they ' ll like it , order a masala dosa ( lightly spiced potato in a rice pancake -- delicious and simple . this is a really nice restaurant . 
this place is awesome , best wings anywhere , burgers too , also great drink prices and superb service , N thumbs way up ! 
best or only brick oven pizza in the neighborhood . their different style pizzas are delicious and make it hard to choose from . they deliver , very convenient . 
this should tell you all you need to know i don ' t even like indian food as a rule , and when my partner asks where we should go out to dinner , i say " gandhi " without a second thought . the menu will definitely appeal to just about anyone--i ' ve taken people here who are indian connoisseurs and they love it just as much as i do . three things i recommend the most N . the garlic naan . om nom nom nom . N . the vegetable samosas . they have beef and chicken ones too , but the veggie ones are outstanding . the outside is perfectly cooked and salty , and thick enough to serve as the perfect container for the veggies , potatoes , and sauce . not so thin that it dissolves in your hand , and not so thick that you don ' t taste anything else . N . the bindi masala . i recommend this for folks who don ' t usually like indian food--it ' s fried okra in a spicy tomato and onion sauce . it ' s perfect on rice and also makes for great leftovers . edit also the madras . omg . it is the perfect blend of spice and flavor , and you can get it with crab ( real crab , which is not normal in this soul-crushing city ) for , like , N . are you kidding me ? amazing . bonus if you eat in the restaurant , they have lots of dramatic foreign-language soap operas playing on the tv . also , the staff are incredibly sweet and polite . don ' t hesitate to ask them any questions about the food , or ask them for recommendations . 
blech ! 
i had such high expectations probably because i was really craving tacos . ordered the steak taco and shrimp taco . huge disappointment . the shrimp taco had absolutely no flavor at all . just some lukewarm shrimp on a doughy tortilla . the steak was a little better though not by far . again lacking get flavor and still a super doughy tortilla . they could have at least grilled it a little . never again . waste of N
i took a spanish friend here last night . before we got our food i joked with him that he probably wouldn ' t be impressed , given how good spanish food is . we order the foie gras donut and the skate . the former actually did impress him . win . the donut came out hot , golden and slightly crispy , the brightness of the berry sauce blended superbly with the rich , earthy foie . so good . eat it while it ' s hot . the skate dish looks gorgeous . the skate is fried , then fanned out beautifully and dressed with greens and a ( mole ? ) sauce , mango dressing , rice and beans . i found the dish appetizing but a bit too salty . the menu will not overwhelm you . there are only a handful of things listed under " small plates " and " large plates " so you ' re not going to have to deal with the paralyzing array of options some menus present . the wait staff were very nice . the atmosphere is that of a typical hip brooklyn bar dark wood , low lights a blend of classy and grungy hipster . 
i went to local N last night for the first time , and the bartender was awesome . i ' m sure this isn ' t all i ' m supposed to say . i ' m sure i should also tell you that the ambiance was nice , it was busy but not too loud , we got a table for two by the bar with no wait at N N on a wednesday , the food and beer were both great , and the location is convenient to transit and parking . sure , fine . but the bartender was really great . he was one of those bartenders who seems to always know the second your eye lifts toward the bar . he was solicitous , helpful , and knowledgable . he recommended the perfect beer , and was patient and relaxed in his service over about four hours . the second we even thought we might want food , he was there , but he was never overbearing . and this might seem small , but i asked for water with lemon , and he refilled my water three more times over the course of the night , and every single time he remembered that i wanted lemon , and he dropped a fresh slice in for me . it was really , really great service . so go here ! and tip your bartender well . seriously . he ' s a gem . 
delious garlic chicken pork broth i got the minca sio bowl N , quite enjoyable but i had better around the city . its missing that wonderful semi runny salty hard boil egg ( nitamago ) i love so much but won ' t rule out coming hear if i am in the area next time
this is easily the best meal i ' ve ever had in philly . everything was incredible . i strongly recommend getting the tasting menu ( especially for first timers ) . in addition , you need to reserve at least a week or two in advance for weekend reservations . 
very good italian food with a huge list of specials . wait staff was phenomenal and the food was just as good . i had no problem getting a table for two on a friday night . all around great experience , we will be returning soon ! 
awesome sampling of philly ' s best restaurants and cuisines . whether you are local , or just visiting , reading terminal market is a must see ! ! ! 
this small pizzeria just off of times square was awesome ! the tomato basil pizza was amazing ! the ingredients were fresh and the garlic made it just perfect . the crust was so good . my boyfriend enjoyed and tried the pepperoni and sausage which he really enjoyed , but after tasting my tomato basil pizza was thinking of ordering one to go . . . . he did and couldn ' t stop raving about it . the heavy minced garlic on the garlic rolls was great tasting , but be warned , if you don ' t like that much garlic this little roll is not for you . overall we were very pleased with patzeria . the pizza was tasty , good price and well done . seating is very limited and gets extremely crowded so take it to go . could be just perfect to take to the park and enjoy . . . will go again ! 
the soup is so unique and delicious . they range from thai zucchini ( which is absolutely delicious and i buy four quarts for dinner parties ) to old school chicken noodle ( which is classicly spectacular ) they now have a store as well as doing the farmers markets N whitney ave hamden , ct check them out at www . soupgirl . com or call N . N . soup
they put eggs on my vegan sandwich . and because it was filled with egg , they didn ' t put much else on it so after waiting N minutes for it and walking back to work ( another N minutes ) , i have two pieces of bread for lunch . for most , its not an option to ' go back and get another or ask them to fix it ' , we have fixed lunch hour breaks so there ' s not much to do but realize you wasted around N . N on nothing . i understand it gets busy , but invest in a second person to confirm the order and to hand out the food while one person takes the order and payment . it ' ll streamline the process and hopefully you ' ll have less disgruntled customers . since i still taste remnants of egg on my sandwich ( after removing them carefully ) , i will not be coming back . 
good clean chinese food . no msg , fresh veggies and great service . 
we came to rosa blanca celebrating our seven year anniversary and we were so happy with our choice to come here . when you first walk into rosa blanca , the atmosphere is that of a cute , cuban diner . the diner bar seats turn to a bar section as you walk in , and then you enter the booth and table seating section - this is where we dined . it is a really cute restaurant . it is nice without feeling stuffy and decorated enough to make you know you ' re in a cuban restaurant while restrained enough to not feel like you ' re dining in disney world . our server , andalyn , was awesome . she was sweet , funny , had great recommendations ( the ah fuego cocktail - yum ! ) , and always made sure we had what we needed . the food ( and we love and know cuban food well ) was delicious ! the bread at the beginning was divine , our entrees ( ropa vieja and vaca frita ) were amazing , and the cocktails were out of this world . my vaca frita was so tender and i loved the pickled onions on top my husband declared his ropa vieja was the best he ' s ever had . we also tried the pineapple guac and pineapple dessert , which were very good , but i ' d trade them for something else next time . the only thing we had that was below average were the tostones - they were definitely too salty ( and i like salt ) and overcooked ( very crunchy ) to the point where they reminded me of a mcdonald ' s hashbrown . but just steer clear of those and you are going to have a meal to remember for a long time . we would definitely recommend this place and are already talking about bringing family here when they come to visit . thanks for an awesome night , rosa blanca ! 
the best gyro i ' ve ever had . now i know why there is so much hype ! i will definitely come back every time i ' m in nyc . the line moves very fast and love large portions ! only N bucks ! cant beat that ! 
the food is overpriced for such small servings . i order a chipotle wrap and its so small compared to competition . i say no pickles they add pickles to my order . the coleslaw tastes yucky and dry . the music is down , and cold , and extrememly low for a downtown scene . the hispanic girl at the counter has been very friendly and funny consistently . and she always has some fab glasses on . i havent seen her in a couple weeks now tho hmm everyone else that works there appear snooty and like they havent brushed their hair for work . they greet you because its their job , its not sincere at all . they stand there waiting for the food to come up and it seems like one lady wants to control it all . theres an old guy ive seen twice now , ponytail , european looking , face like the grinch , staring at the way these ladies work with disgust . i can tell he is a manager or boss of some sort . the kitchen is of course loaded with mexicans so the food is done well . bag of chips at N . N are overpriced and so are drinks at N . N a pop . they bake fresh breads which is the only upside . the pastries are somewhat dry and lackluster . the cookies are the best part of this place . go for the cowboy or chocolate chip . prepare to spend over N on lunch and drinks for two people . if u want a salad prepare to spend about N . N just to add chicken or tuna . seared tuna another whopping N bucks . if you want some good food for a reasonable price go to long wharf food trucks . or even downtown by yale food trucks galore N bucks can take u far and fill you up . 
i first tried houston ' s in orlando during a business dinner . i was so impressed that when i stumbled across it in nyc , i naturally gave it a try . houston ' s has since changed their name to hillstone , however , not much else has changed . my favorite aspects of hillstone is the decor , ambiance , live music in the bar and the friendly staff . decor - elegant , darker themed restaurant which is perfect to wind down at the end of a long day . i would come here for the decor alone . ambiance - great place to take a date or to enjoy a nice dinner and have conversation . bar music - while waiting for a table , we waited in the bar and were pleasantly surprised by a N piece act playing soft music in the back ground . very nice touch . friendly staff - the staff is very professional and personable . hillstone does not take reservations , however , their waiting list is pretty exact . the wait does not exceed the time given . they transfer your bar check to the restaurant to avoid the pain of having to cash out and go find the rest of your party being seated in the restaurant . 
good service , good ambience and yummy italian food ! the seating is a little cramped but the spaghetti here is awesome ! will def be back ! 
came here for my anniversary dinner . . had the blueberry pancakes ( ta die for ) the maple butter syrup really compliments them . . i also had the fried green tomatoes . N N N hour wait -totally worth it . enjoy . ! 
my husband and i traveled into the city for a fun day and dined at this new restaurant . it was fabulous ! the food was absolutely out of this world ! the service was perfection and the decor right out of a magazine ! i also must add that the desserts were amazing ! so beautifully presented ! the homemade ice cream and the eggnog cheesecake were heavenly . the hand painted chocolate christmas box with the handmade chocolates were nothing i ever tasted before ! i asked who the pastry chef was and they said it was a woman named genevieve meli . wow , i sure would love to have her come to my upstate home and cater my christmas party ! we are so looking forward to returning and will do so next month . best experience ever ! 
good food but it comes with a price . lunch was N tip . 
i don ' t know that i would travel to come here , though i know that lots of people do . but this is a fine neighborhood establishment . to eat in , to take out , whatever . it ' s reliable . they ' re open even in the cruddiest weather . it ' s always noisy and it ' s nearly impossible to have a conversation using your normal speaking voice , but it ' s comfortable and good . i highly recommend the buffalo chicken sandwich and , to my constant surprise , the gardenburger club , to which i became addicted a couple years ago . i love the fries . additionally , this is one of those rare bars ( rare in america , anyhow ) where you can safely bring children without pissing off everyone . the service staff is usually very friendly and welcoming , even to small fry , and i appreciate that even more now i ' ve got a small fry of my own . 
i came here with high expectations and left with them fulfilled . the service was great , the ambiance was perfect , the music was killer , and the food was wonderful . i ordered the meatball sliders of course . they were very good but difficult to consume due to their height haha . i also had a side of their french fries with spicy aioli . i daresay little owl fries a perfect french fry . very very tasty . service was great , water was always filled and the servers were very friendly . i also enjoyed the salt bowl and candlelight . loses a star because they don ' t have their award-winning burger on the menu ( and it was N bucks for sliders and fries . . . a little high
one of the best italian dining experiences in the area . . . including the city . 
i was determined to get me some curried goat when i went back to nyc , especially after the bomb curried goat i had for the first time from muffin man in maryland ( but that ' s another review ) . we found the place , but i was very disappointed when we got there that we couldn ' t sit anywhere upstairs was blocked off and chair were on top of the tables . but then when i saw that only one person was the cook and cashier , but as a sidenote i ' ve worked in restaurants and as a culinary school grad , i understand that food and labor cost becomes an issue especially everywhere but in big cities like new york , those costs can close your door quickly . so i understood why it was set-up more as a to-go spot for lunch . nevertheless , i was still excited about my curried goat , and my cousins got jerk chicken , and my aunt ordered a vegetable and rice dish . all of our dishes came with rice beans and cabbage . the portions were extremely generous . there were four of us but only three dishes , and two other people could have easily have eaten and gotten full , probably with leftovers lol . my curried goat was very tasty , the meat just fell off the bone ( yeah there were still bones in there , so be careful ) . the rice beans were tasty as well . . . . i tasted something coconut milk , and possibly a touch of nutmeg ( don ' t quote me on the nutmeg ) . the cabbage was ol ' skool tasty , like i ' m used to eating in the south . my cousins ' jerk chicken was very spicy . . . very jerk ( glad i had some water nearby ) . it definitely had that nice mouth burn factor that so many of us like ( they weren ' t used to food that spicy hot tho . . lol ) . and my aunts rice had carrots and peas , although basic it definitely wasn ' t lacking on flavor . all in all the food was great , and definitely just as good the next day ! ! ! although we didn ' t get to eat inside , i recommend you eating at the museum across the street on the place out front with the nice grassy patches ! ! ! nice place for a lunch picnic ! ! the one star deductions is just because we didn ' t have the option to eat there . 
just celebrated our thirtieth anniversary here . as a gay couple , even in vt we have experienced some " uncomfortable " anniversary celebrations in high end restaurants . not the case here , yes we were privy to other tables conversations but unlike the church street restaurant with the tables jammed together we did not have to pretend to ignore them . instead we were engaged with our surrounding four tops and gave reviews that may have helped with their choices as well . overall best service in burlington ( sorry american flatbread , close second ) yes dark , noisy , expensive ( did you read the other reviews ? ) well worth the money ! ! ! best dinner to date . 
this is a solid breakfast place - but not worth the wait ( what place is , really ? ) the biscuits are even better than the pancakes . helpful hint show up before they start serving booze or wait out the line across the street at the coffee shop . 
i can ' t say enough good things about this restaurant . truly the best service i ' ve ever received . i ' ve been back many times and they are constantly updating the menu so i ' ve never had the same thing twice . love , love , love this place ! i ' ve never had a bad experience , i ' ve never even had a so-so experience . . . it ' s always the best when i eat here ! 
can go toe to toe with anyplace i ' ve dined at in nyc , and for us a neighborhood place - which really treats you like it . never had a bad dish , wine list and cocktails are excellent and extensive . jeff is a miracle for wine selections and hosts tastings too . 
nice food . . falafels are fresh ! can have better hummus ! service can be little better . overall good food ! 
i have been to this restaurant several times now and not only was the food , service and staff great , but the entertainment was also great ! the food was outstanding and chef anthony came to our table to make sure everything was perfecto ! i was so impressed , i just booked a party there for september . i never ordered a meatball at a restaurant my life . as an italian woman you would understand that . . . but because i was with my brother the first time i went he ordered it . the inside out meatball was delicious with a litlle surprise inside ) excellent ! i have been sending friends and family there now and they never dissappoint . i would highly recommend this restaurant . 
so i ' ve tried perilla twice now and i can honestly say it ' s a good meal . the restaurant itself is off the beaten path ( which i kind of like ) hidden away on jones . the seating is typical of new york restaurants unless you get a nice booth . i love the clean wooden floor and orange color which give the place a warm feeling in combination with old classics playing on the speakers . this could be a scene in a nora ephron classic . the most important part is the food . he offers a tasting menu that i ' m going to come back and try eventually but i don ' t know why the vegetarian one is promoted . i guess it ' s the area served . the duck meatballs are good . it ' s truth . swirl the cute little quail egg yolk over it and get a little saucy and your taste buds will be dancing a jig . the oysters are fresh on the half shell . the farro risotto is delicious , creamy but not too rich . i had the roasted duck and i ' ve never had it this way but i went with the recommended ' medium rare ' . sounds strange no ? it was delicious and not in the gross way that my friends hangar steak was rare . did i mention i tried that bloody steak and it was also delicious in a classic , and it ' s not really just fresh off a cow , way ? ? my companion N enjoyed the fish dish . i ' m not sure what it was but it was served almost asian style with pickled vegetable things . i wasn ' t a fan of either of the fish dishes i ' ve had here . we also sampled some cheese . the sheep selection is good , a little tangy like i like my sheep . they have a decent delicious selection served with bread . the server also mentioned that harold deiterle is known for his duck preparations . . . stick to what you know right ? 
overall , i really enjoyed my experience at blue . i love to go to fine dining restaurants , and i think that i am able to identify good food when i see and taste it ( the food at blue was exquisite ) . with that said , the staff at blue were completely mystified as to how to accommodate me , a vegetarian . most restaurants in this day and age have at least a few menu items that are vegetarian and vegan . even at other well-known high-end restaurants ( the todd english and daniel balouds of the world ) , there are a few vegetarian vegan options . at blue , there was literally no vegetarian entree available . i very much appreciated the staff and manager ' s attempt to accommodate me , as they asked me what kind of dish i wanted -- but eventually it was up to me to design a meal for myself ( a pasta dish ) , when i would have preferred to experience the creativity of the chef and what blue had to offer ( in which the only creative confine would be that the meal be vegetarian ) . i really don ' t think that vegetarian and vegans should have to miss out dining at a place like blue . the restaurant is beautiful , the tomato soup i had was absolutely delicious , as was the bread pudding dessert , as well as the avocado carpaccio appetizer we had . i know this restaurant is capable of producing a fine vegetarian meal . so i ask the managers of this establishment -- please expand your entree options for vegetarians , and you will open up a new customer base ! 
so different but is good to try new styles of food in this world hope next time a order new and tasty ! ! ! 
i love this place . if you are in the mood for a gourmet pizza , this is the place to go . the old smokey is unbelievably delicious . the owner is often there making pizzas and tending the register himself which is good to see . there isn ' t a ton of seating but they do set out tables on the sidewalk and most of the time , i ' d take it with me anyway . 
i wanted to edit my cantina review because they have really improved in the last year . they have new management , new staff and new food . i love the atmosphere in the bar area--it ' s friendly and not too loud to have a conversation . i usually end up having a beer or two and one special margarita . most recently , i had a cherry margarita . it tasted like a cherry limeade--i ' m definitely getting another one ! brunch is my preferred meal at cantina . they always feature new specials and delicious bloody marys and marias . my favorite picks at cantina ? -goat tacos or burrito -plantains -ensalada de nopal -breakfast burrito with veggie sausage -pastel de chocolate ( chocolate mousse with a bit of hot chili ) if you want to get the most out of it , head to cantina during a weekday or night--or for a late brunch ( try between N and Npm ) . it gets very crowded on weekend nights so plan ahead . 
we split a mini pitcher of red sangria and it was perfect . i want to have brunch here . you sit on stools with the windows open overlooking tompkins square park . no one bothers you , the music seems loud but it ' s festive . the bathroom situation is cramped , but accessible . i was there on half priced taco sunday but didnt partake . best city sangria after pipa , but i have no reason to be in gramercy so yuca will do just fine . 
i recently ordered pizza for my work crew from here . we got a few plain pizzas and picked them up . definitely one of the better slices i ' ve had in a while . 
 N basic with thin noodles is the best ramen in nyc . we will make a special trip from queens just to have this . although the service with the waitresses can be a little better the cooks are super friendly and they remember us and know what we want when we arrive . 
needed to have a quick lunch close bye in south philly . read the reviews and thought i would give it a try . the summer rolls are some of the best i have ever eaten . fresh and tasty . the tom yum , soup was delicious along with the best pad thai . price was reasonable and i will be returning in the future . 
we normally go to kumo every saturday night and eat at the sushi bar . recently our favorite sushi chef has not been there , the food and the service have suffered . we are very sad that we have to pick a new favorite . 
excellent quick lunch for only N . N ! the falafel sandwich is a pretty good portion filled with fresh chunks of tomatoes , crispy shredded lettuce , and this bomb tahini sauce in tasty pita . didn ' t try their hot sauce , but perhaps i ' ll try it next time . i think people are always intimated by the line , but your orders are made rather quickly . . just make sure to know what you ' re going to order before you get to the front of the line . also , the place is tiny ( only two small sit-down tables and no elbow room left for those in line ) , so grab your bag and get outta there . 
hands down the best cheese steak . i ' ve had all the other ones inlcuding geno ' s , jim ' s , steve ' s , etc . you have to get it wiz wit ( cheese whiz , and with fried onions ) and it ' s the best . their cheese fries is also excellent . the lines are long if you go prime time , but sometimes it can be long even at late nights . must bring cash ! the parking can be horrible at times and it ' s the the nicest neighborhood so i would go with friends definitely . 
sorry but i am a stickler for service ! i went here last night with my fiance and was very disappointed to find out that you " can not substitute sides ' ! really ! ? how ! ? both my fiance and i follow the paleo diet and so we can not eat things like french fries , mashed potatoes , etc . i wanted to order a N steak and instead of fries asked for first asparagus ( they said no ) , then a side salad ( they said no again ) . keep in mind that i Nwas happy to be flexible and was not asking to substitute more expensive items for cheaper ones . i knew it wasn ' t the waiter ' s fault and kindly asked that i speak with a manager . i politely explained my situation to the manager and she politely told me she didn ' t give a crap . no exceptions to the rules and no desire to make the client happy . just no ! there are too many restaurants with equally as good of food ( most even better ) with more reasonable rates who will care about service . never again ! i also know a lot of theatre goers ( i was actually referred ti joe allen from a friend ) and will make sure to relay my experience . go where they care about service , not where they don ' t . 
the food here is super fantastic and i love the fact that it is out of annoying northern liberties with its throngs of penquin hipsters who all seem to think and act the same way . i love the fact that the hinge is a jewel island tucked away from annoying hipster land . linda the waitress is the best who doesn ' t love her ? i wish the owners were more friendly--too often they seem grumpy and unsmiling and they never say hello even though they " know " you . what ' s up with that ? i will continue to go despite this , however . 
this too is a response to jp ' s comments . . . first foremost , you seem like a gigantic tool . are you sure you weren ' t out to dinner with your boyfriend ? cause your story was a bit much , drama queen . you should spend more time getting over yourself less time on yelp because i ' d be willing to bet that the waiters and rest of the staff there work N times harder during one shift than your dumb ass has worked in a life-time . . . p . s . - find a new place to take your boyfriend out to dinner . 
this family has been ripping people off for N years ! there should be a big sign stating " if anyone expected to get any visible mozzerella cheese on their sicilian pizza , they went to the wrong place ! " this " family " charges N for a box of dough and sauce ! this place doesn ' t put any significant amount of mozzerella cheese on their sicilian pizza and have been getting away with it for N years ! yes , you have the right to make your pizza any way you wish , but you should state there will be no visible mozzerella cheese ! in all the reviews i ' ve read about your place , none stated that the amount of mozzerella cheese used is so infinitesimal , that it becomes invisible by getting " absorbed into the dough . " now i wonder whether your rainbow spumoni is actually made with real pistaccio nuts or fake imitations such as peanuts . no wonder why so many fat people eat at spumoni gardens . . . they ' re eating pizza without cheese to lose weight . your place is a dieter ' s delight ! also no wonder why it ' s difficult to eat only one slice there ' s no substance to the damn stuff ! won ' t be going back , and neither will the pizza loving friends of tony . " if i wanted a foccaccia , i wouldn ' t have ordered a pizza ! " avoid the sicilian if you expect any cheese on it . the dough and sauce are tasty . napolitan pizza has expected amount of cheese . 
i ' ve been craving thai food for awhile now , and was very happy to have found this place . had tom yum soup , spring rolls and dumplings for appetizers , and the pad thai and red curry as entrees . overall , it was pretty good . my only gripe was the lemon for the pai thai - that lost me on the authenticity right there . it would have been so much better with a slice of lime - so the pai thai came out a little sweeter and not as tangy as i ' m used to . 
this place is right near my apartment , so it ' s a welcome addition to the neighborhood . it ' s a nice bar to grab a drink and the food selection is also a nice step above typical bar food . awesome beer selection and the service is fairly good ( much better than you ' d expect for a new place ) . it can get a bit loud , but not unbearable . it ' s my new go-to place to grab a drink with some friends . 
really good french food in a non-stuffy atmosphere and actually pretty reasonably priced by nyc standards . and i love the byob aspect . they have several variations of mussels as appetizers and there ' s a reason for that - they are really good ! properly cleaned , perfectly cooked , and yummy . i wish we had time to stay for dessert . 
tonight was my second time there . its quiet on sunday afternoons evenings ( i have not been there anytime else ) the crepes are awesome . i like the choice ( s ) of alcohol . but the " do everything " bartender waitress is freaking awesome ! ! ! ( give her a raise ) ( and if she ' s the owner . . . . even better ! ! ! --good for you ! ) and she has zero attitude . sweetheart personality . gorgeous eyes . not to mention the tats . definately will be going back . N stars from me . definately a nice spot to chill out and relax . if your on a date or with friends or even family , well on sunday . . . . 
food is great during the day and the place is perfect to grab a late beer or shoot a game of pool . really wish the prices would drop a bit so that i didn ' t get rung up for a huge tab every time i bring my friends there . however far and away the best place to meet up with a larger group in the area . 
love firebird cafe ! we ' ve been here N-N times and have always enjoyed ourselves ! great people too ! 
worth the line . worth the wait . perfect pizza
mmmmm . . . . i had the best godamn burger here today ! 
my fianc and i enjoyed our meal here very much . i had the emmentaler sausage special , which was incredible , and she had the liptauer , which isn ' t really my thing but she enjoyed it . the decor and " feel " of the place are perfect . it ' s very small , the music is soft but noticeable , and the wait staff is extremely helpful and friendly . oh , and the chocolate cake for dessert was wonderful . 
 N ( ) mix N 
this used to be a weekend tradition when we lived a block away . we ' ve only ever ordered breakfast , but that alone is extremely affordable and delicious . their menu is impressive and the breakfast platters are large enough for two people to share ( or for one person to take home to enjoy later ) . i will say that it is comparable to diner food , so if you ' re looking for crazy bells and whistles , you ' ll be disappointed . as a convenient deli and cafe though , this place is great . we recommend the french toast . 
update N N N - finally had the burger . my friend got the whaleys ( premium ground beef , tomato , lettuce , beet , pineapple , fried egg ketchup ) and i got the bronte sans mayo ( premium ground beef , tomato , lettuce , sweet chilli , mayo cheese ) . holy mother . the bronte is so good . the patty is perfectly seasoned , the sweet chili sauce ( oh my ) and the bread . . . it ' s not your regular hamburger bun . it ' s got that chewy texture that i love . my burger was perfect . they whaleys was delish , but i ' m not a fan of fruits and beets in my burgers . the flavors do work very well together though . next time i come back ( probably soon ) , will be getting the bronte . also , dying to try the shrimp pasta ( spaghetti pasta , chilli oil , lime , fresh tomatoes and arugula ) . 
i agree with the other reviews that say this place is neither good nor bad . after reading all the wonderful reviews and waiting in line in the cold for a little under an hour , the following meal was much less than we ' d expected . it wasn ' t worth the hype or the wait . i ' ve also had much better eggs benedict at other brunch places . 
great relaxing dining . 
nothing can compare to this tiny gem ! i am salivating just thinking about their delicious pizza . . . be prepared to make friends with the people next to you , because seating is manhattan style . i have never been disappointed with bivio ' s food , and ihighly recommend getting whatever the special of the day is , because it is guaranteed to be fresh and delish ! 
i have been to la petite france a few times since it opened . though their selection has improved vastly since they first opened , i wished the atmosphere was more bourgeoisie than parisian . since one of the owners is originally from france , expect it to be very european tiny portions and overpriced . if you visit there on the weekdays , there are some lunch specials at a-ok prices . sometimes you can find coupons in the coupon clipper magazine or if you sign up for their e-mail blasts . don ' t go there when you are ravenously hungry because you will still be hungry when you leave . i do appreciate the interior decor and the french magazines on the shelf , which are fun to look through though i don ' t know much french . the only thing i recommend is the buttered croissant . you can skip the other baked goods . their lattes are decent , but i like the ones from hartford baking co . a lot better , you have the option of getting skim milk . my recommendation is to offer a baguette and butter option for those who eat inside . perhaps they can bake small ones for sit-down customers and long one for takeout customers . 
their rolls will amaze but when the lobster ain ' t there you ' ll pull out your hair
i live in the area and my boss recommended this place , so then i obviously had to go . i ' ve been a few times now and love it every time . the two times i ' ve been could not have been more different . first time was with boo , so nice and romantic by the front window , and the second time was with a large group of co-workers visiting from san francisco . if visiting with a large loud group like i was , you may get a dirty look or two , since the ambiance is generally softer and more romantic . the food though , is awesome . in a city with a million different italian restaurants , emporio comes up with unique , interesting dishes that are deeeeelish . the waiters are very friendly as well . probably one of if not my favorite italian place in nyc . N stars ! 
excellent food , embarrassingly horrible service . the waitstaff attitude is not unlike mean girls . the first few times i ' ve been there i ' ve gone in the afternoon when it wasn ' t crowded so obviously we didn ' t have to wait , and the food was amazing . i was very impressed by their thin crust pizza and walnut apple salad . the aesthetics were quite unique , especially the bathrooms and i liked how they handed your change to you in a glass - pretty cool . the last time i went there was early on a saturday night with my husband . we were told there was an hour wait yet i saw an open booth and there was no line . the hostess was curt , condescending and somewhat aloof , like we were bothering her . so we left and i ' ll never set foot into that establishment again . 
best shawarma in philly ! ! ! ! ! ! i was first introduced to chicken shawarma in boston and i loved it . a year ago i went to israel and ordered chicken shawarma in a shop next to the wailing wall . not as good as boston . i asked my jewish friends here in philly where i might find shawarma , and was told that hummus was the best ! guess what folks , it is the best ! ! ! not only there shawarma , but everything else that i ' ve tried at hummus is fantastic as well . if you go , you must also try their salmon ceasar salad . salmon was moist and perfectly cooked . favorite middle eastern in philly . 
wrong place sorry
we went to go ! go ! curry for lunch on a weekday . we were hungry and the portion sizes were large . the price was right - very affordable , and the food was good , the menu is somewhat limited , but what they have is pretty tasty . also , there ' s not a ton of seating in the restaurant , but there is quick turnover . this is the kind of restaurant you don ' t spend a lot of time in , but you walk away happy and full . 
terrible food ! i am cuban and can N say , don ' t waste your money . the place may have cute atmosphere , but the food is absolutely awful ! the rice was dry , the platanos had no taste , everything i tasted was over cooked ! i would never return and would never recommend anyone . over priced also ! stick to bergenline avenue , this place is not even cuban ! it is an embarrassment to cuban people to call this a cuban restaurant ! 
greasy cuban food in a narrow , crowded hole-in-the-wall , but definitely a great choice for lunch in the area . everyone ' s really nice here and the food is served cafeteria style grab a tray , tell them ( or point out ) what you want , and they ' ll scoop some onto a plate for you . seating is limited so definitely grab a table as soon as someone starts to get up . the oxtail was pretty good but i really loved the pig ' s feet tripe - amazing flavor and texture . the serving was pretty small but it came with a generous plate of rice ( choose from white rice , yellow rice , or a third kind i don ' t remember ) , beans ( black or white ) , and a few pieces of yummy plantains . the cuban sandwich is also supposed to be pretty amazing . 
awful service . hostile manager . 
wife and i were in new york with my N year-old son . this place was recommended by a friend who lives on the upper east side . we had the linguini aglio and penne pomodoro . both were delicious . they tasted fresh but still had plenty of deep , rich flavor . ambiance was quaint and didn ' t seem like it was trying too hard . very comfortable . very authentic . very good . 
upon my last visit to mamas i discovered they now serve steak souvlaki and home made chicken soup ! needless to say i ran back on here and immediately updtated my review . the steak souvlaki is juicy and charred just like carne asada or skirt steak , needless to say my new favorite choice . . secondly the chicken soup is unreal . exactly like my moms at home . people need to know how legit this soup is because even at the citys best soup spots , some just dont have that home made taste . 
found a groupon deal and decided to try it out during a weeknight . nice wine , nice waiter and nice food . they have large range of wine selection , very nice place for dating . my bf and i had a great night there . 
went here on a friday for lunch with family at N pm . 
i have to agree that this is the best deal in the city ! for N a four course tasting menu that is out of this world ! i went with a couple friends and we brought two bottles of wine with us . they were about N a piece , which is how much one drink would run you anywhere . i started with the pan seared scallop which was to die for ! then , i got the gnocchi , which was cooked perfectly . there is a huge margin of error when cooking gnocchi , but this was perfect , just tender enough with out being doughy . i finished with prosciutto-wrapped duck which i thought was a little over cooked for my liking , but the flavor was great . they gave us a plate of four desserts to split between the three of us to finish it off and then three shots of sambuca . it was a great start to a great night . will certainly go back again because you can ' t beat this deal in the city ! 
foods good not great , large place only been their for lunch , not sure about the night life
if you ' ve never been , like before us this past weekend , run , run , run , run , run to hobby ' s . the most amazing deli food we ' ve had in ages . blows places like eppes essen and irving ' s away . reminds me of the type of jewish " style " delis that used to be a dime a dozen in the city and on long island when i was growing up . can ' t believe we never made it here sooner . now that this gem has finally been discovered , we ' ll definitely be back . you ' ve got to try the " onion rings " . those alone are worth the trip . we had corned beef and pastrami and were blown away by both , so totally delicious . it was our only meal of the day , be sure to go hungry , you will not leave that way . next time i ' m trying the matzoh ball soup , didn ' t have it but was oogling it on someone else ' s table , looked amazing . 
i just had to try the infamous corn on the cob . i regret wasting my money . it was gross in ways i can ' t describe with words ! i think it ' s just the cheese that comes on it , it was not very appealing to my tastebuds at all ! ! i don ' t know if when i ' d go back to try something else . 
don ' t let the outside fool you , the exterior doesn ' t do the food justice . we live nearby and decided to give it a try as it ' s a fairly new restaurant . we now go at least every two weeks . we haven ' t eaten in yet , only take-out and delivery . haven ' t been disappointed with a single dish yet . everything is fresh and clearly homemade . they are also always very nice and friendly . the prices are also very reasonable . highly recommend surrender cafe ! 
bean curd with egg is good . indian crisp pancake is also good . hainanese chicken is good as well . 
you will never find another place as awesome as this . this is a huge food market . there are people from all cultures and backgrounds here making food and selling goods . it doesn ' t matter what you want to eat you will find it here and it will be amazing . there were foods and cultures from places all over the world . not only the food but there are so many people from different cultures from the area that come here to eat . it ' s truly a really awesome place to be . there is paid street parking and there always seems to be a spot because people are constantly coming and going . i went to a creole place and had an alligator po boy with creole mustard . so tasty and sweet you wouldn ' t even know you were eating alligator unless you were told . i also had some alligator gumbo which was a bit spicy but it was so awesome there . i would suggest people go here or even the market in general and eat at all of the little places because each one was more interesting then the next . 
good stuff . i love ethiopian food and this place is solid . injera is nice and sour ( and they have the traditional teff injera which is gluten-free - just gotta ask for it ) . the lamb tibs was tasty . came with a few veggie sides which were good though a bit on the salty side . would love to try their other meats and veggies . 
the corn here is amazing ! i had meant to get a steak burrito but didn ' t specify and got a steak sandwich instead . sooo glad that happened because the sandwich was delicious ! definitely recommend going to cafe habana over the restaurant next door the food is good and the wait isn ' t as long . 
it was a bit pricey . the service was good , the food was good . 
oh bibou . you ' ve set a very high standard for fine dining in philadelphia . my girlfriend and i went for her birthday . if you use open table , be prepared to be on at midnight a month in advance of when you want to make a reservation , though it might be best to call instead ( i used open table ) . bibou ' s storefront is wholly unassuming-- possibly a converted corner home that has a humble sign with its signature " b . " it ' s next to a municipal parking lot on Nth st . just past carpenter , so parking is a breeze . as you enter , you realize that there may be N tables in the entire restaurant , and as you eat you ' re incredibly fortunate to sit at one . the hostess was incredibly polite , sat us immediately ( even though we were a few minutes early ) , and the table was spotless . one of our servers quickly filled our water glasses , opened our wine ( it ' s byob ! ! ! ) , gave us our menus , and brought us a lovely sliced baguette . we had a moment to realize just how delightfully the place is decorated , with little french accents . along with the menu , the server informed us of the specials for both first plates and the main course . we began with a fois gras duo and creamy risotto with shaved black truffle . first , i could not believe that these two dishes came out of the kitchen in less than N minutes . it was such wonderful service we were hardly ever left waiting . the fois gras duo was amazing-- i ' ve never had such high quality fois gras . it was prepared as a mousse topped with an apricot gelatin ( aspic ? ) , and the other was seared with candied apricot and a pumpernickel-like bread soaked in an acidic liquid . great contrast , and an excellent application of fois gras . the risotto receives equally high marks . the arborio rice was cooked to perfection with a creamy broth of stock and mascarpone adding to the richness . the best part was that four or five pieces of shaved black truffle topped the dish . it was the most rich , flavorful risotto i have ever had . what a great start . the plats principaux were also phenomenal . my girlfriend had a sauteed softshell crab on a buckwheat pancake , salad and moutarde . the buckwheat pancake was so light and airy , but it packed so much flavor . the softshell crab was flavored delicately , but it let the crab flavor shine through- so tasty ! my pied de porc ( pig ' s foot ) with lentil " du puy " was incredibly rich and packed with , what else , fois gras . i have only had pickled pigs ' feet at my grandmother ' s behest N years ago . this was completely different and so incredible . the pork was deboned and melted in your mouth . the lentils were cooked to perfection with petit carrot brunoise and chopped bacon ( real bacon ) . i loved every bite . for dessert , the strawberry-rhubarb pie with a merengue top was mindblowingly good . my lemon verbena creme brulee had perfect texture , but i think the lemon gave it a slightly bitter flavor and didn ' t have enough sugar to get through the richness of my first two dishes . to end , they brought my girlfriend two macarons with a candle for her birthday ( both delicious ) . during the night , the chef came over and greeted us , talked for a bit , explained some of the dishes , and was so sincerely cordial . it was an unbelievable experience all around . i would give it N stars if i could , but five will have to do . 
i love this place . saw the reviews on yelp and i had to give it a try . walking in , this place was packed ! i had the cuban sandwich and the mashed cassava w pork . all i can say was that it was delicious . i would definitely come back again . and again . you can easily get takeout but there is table service in the back . 
bravo . so many good things to say about this place . the food is absolutely wonderful . everyone knows the salatim and hummus are fantastic , but a word on the rest of the food family - the best haloumi i ' ve ever had ( pan fried with peaches and walnuts ) . - the duck hearts are fantastic - the charcoal chicken is unbelievably moist tender awesome - their kibbe naya isn ' t like sitty makes , but it was pretty darn good and this is the only place in philly i ' ve found that serves it . their serrano chile spread explosion . i took some home . the cocktails are delightfully inventive . most are fairly sweet , so if you don ' t dig this , you may disagree . decent enough beer selection . and omg , the desserts are excellent . i would have never imagined pralined chickpeas could be so good . solomonov was there and came over and chatted with is for awhile . a very nice guy . he actually ended up sending us a free dish which was awesome . i guess my charm was too great ( or the N we spent ) . 
this is my favorite thai restaurant . all dishes are flavorful , fresh and inexpensive . they also have a bar and a dj that plays live music at nights . i prefer to come here in the early evening hours to avoid massive crowds , noise and long waiting lines to be seated . 
customer service was horrible i ordered fresh spring rolls and there was no chicken in them which is contrary to what the menu stated . i asked about it and they argued with me saying there was ground chicken in it . i tore it apart and there was zero chicken . they continued to argue . my friend had minimal chicken on his chicken salad and they argued about this too so we walked away without eating . 
the food is always excellent . the servers are always friendly . if the manager is there , he ' ll make sure to say hello . even people who love meat will love this place . the food is prepared as to taste like chicken or beef ( unless you order a strictly veggie entree ) yet it is completely vegetarian and low fat . must go . 
i am a recent jersey transplant and i loooove this place . the oxtails were slamming ! a bit pricey but worth every penny . i have zero complaints and i will definitely be back . 
cheap , quick ( the line moves a bit slowly but i ' ve never waited more than N mins before ) , tasty-enough lunch if you ' re in the area . i usually ask them not to add rhe sauce bc i find it a bit too salty . the small size is deceivingly filling . just try not to think abt how much msg you ' re consuming and you ' ll be just fine ! 
impressed with every single dish that came out . the staff was courteous and extremely on point . i will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu . 
had an ok time . . . maybe it was because i went on a cold rainy day . seemed to kill the mood of everybody working there . ordered just a hot dog , and it came out right quick . like i didn ' t even get a chance to whip out my wallet quick . this means all the dogs were pre-cooked and just kept warm , which was sort of a downer . put mustard relish like people recommended and took a bite . the mustard relish was good i must say . the sort of crisp you get on the outside of the hot dog is new and i do like the texture . however , the flavor of the meat itself is a little lacking . didn ' t have juices running out , and didn ' t get that nice meat pork beef whatever meat it was flavor in any bite . would probably go again i just hope my Nnd experience is better . 
pro good food , drinks , and unique concept . con understaffed at the dinning area . overpriced for what it is . 
had a friend who was working here , so i had to check it out . and i was more than impressed satisfied . chicken is delicious , good beer selection , and sides are fantastic . 
pleasant affordable places . worth checking out if you ' re in the area . 
my girlfriend and i stopped in at bombay grill on a whim , craving indian food and wanting to try something new in the area . the both of us , being vegetarians , had a lot of options to choose from . the food was made fresh while we waited . i had the malai kofta and my girlfriend , the methi malai mutter . both of these dishes were excellent ! both dishes were so rich , the flavors robust . the roti was also fresh and perfectly complimented our main dish , soaking up the sauce . the staff was great and helpful too ! the atmosphere is lacking but this is mainly a take-out spot . such a great surprise . i recommend this to any indian food fan in the middlesex county area ! 
i had reached out to eagle trading for a catering order and i ordered an array of sandwiches for a baby shower in the neighborhood . all the guests raved about the delicious sandwiches and kept asking me where they were from ! also , the brooklyn pita chips were super tasty ! thanks again for the delicious sandwiches and suggestions ! 
the food was nothing special . . but when it ' s Nam and you ' re starving . . anything is better than nothing ! you have to try the mac and cheese tho ! ! ! i usually get the meatloaf . . or the silver dollar pancakes . . . but because its open N hours . . . its got my approval ! 
awesome ! ! cool place , great service , fantastic food and the chiang mai fries too good to put into words ! 
the place is a little smaller then i thought but upon walking in and being greeted by natalia i was surprised with how quaint and welcoming zafra was . natalia was very sweet , patient , and extremely corteous . truly a great person to have welcoming you at the door ! now as for the food , it was banging . i am of cuban decent and this place truly captured the flavor of my mothers kitchen and the food was incredibly displayed ! i began with the cuban dumplings which truly are a festive party in your mouth of different seasonings and flavors . i also had the tostones rellenos which were the best i ever had . the lechon asado was moist and not dried out like most places and the black beans ( which i have never been a fan of ) were mouth watering ! ! ! even the white rice was kicking ! ! ! the portions were great for the price but i still had room for tres leches ! ! ! a popular dessert growing up and this place really captured the perfect recipe ! ! ! i followed it with a cafe con leche which basically ended the evening perfectly . thank you natalia for your wonderful service and thank you zafras , i will be back ? ! ! ! 
awesome place ! ! food and decor compliments each other . been there with my wife . loved it . 
was here a few weeks ago and must say loved it ! ! not a big fan of sandwiches , but they did a great job . loved my bubble tea as well ! place is cozy , would have stayed but it was a beautiful day out so i took mines to go . would definitely recommend and go back ! 
i ' ve always had fun when i ' ve come to the narrows . one warning first , though if you don ' t like cramped spaces , this might not be the place for you . with that warning out of the way , and with me admitting i ' m usually apprehensive when it comes to close quarters , i like the back seating area , the bartenders have been attentive whenever i ' ve gone , and the patty melt was so delicious , even if my drunk taste buds weren ' t being too discerning . definitely worth checking out . 
best onion soup i ever had ! steak came out sizzling and was tasty and very good quality . the chorizo appetizer was delicious . line should be out the door . 
went here for the first time on friday for dinner . before entering you could already smell the deliciousness seeping out of the place . when entering you first notice that it ' s definitely on the smaller end giving it that cozy atmosphere . having a light lunch i was eager to order and eager to drink ( byob ) . can ' t say i paid much attention to the decor , place was lit by candles ( kind of dark ) and i was probably too hungry to care . with that being said here ' s the breakdown appetizers N ) escargot prepared in a garlicky butter but not overpowering in flavor . the escargot was cooked just right which left no rubbery texture at all that you might typically get . N ) moules vignerones the sauce is definitely good ( great dipping for bread ) but the mussels were disappointing . it couldve been that we just had a bad batch but it left me scarred and probably wouldn ' t get it again . you get approx N-N mussels in the smaller size , N of them arrived unopened ( not fresh ) and a N N that i had were sandy . i would recommend you skip these and go to flex mussels if that ' s you ' re craving . entrees N ) filet mignon must get if you ' re a steak fan . the only only thing i regret is that it was on the smaller end and therefore wasn ' t enough . i ordered it medium and it came out more towards the medium rare side which is what i was hoping . like butter , it just melts in your mouth . i ' ve been to a couple of " high end " steakhouses and haven ' t found a steak quite as tender . maybe it ' s the foie gras , maybe it ' s the sauce , or maybe it ' s the tlc the chef puts into it ? all i know is it ' s good . N ) hanger steak almost just as tender as the filet mignon , this one comes out already cut for you . another solid choice for those who aren ' t a fan of foie gras . N ) duck arrives cut just like the hanger steak . a bit tougher than the steaks , still as enjoyable . thought the sauce would be more sweet tart but it was definitely still savory . dessert lava cake decently made , served with whipped cream and a scoop of ice-cream which was a great way to finish the meal . per the menu it is a dark chocolate lava cake so it ' s a bit on thte bitter end . if you ' re not a fan of dark chocolate i ' d skip this . service attentive waitresses , wine glass never went empty and didn ' t feel suffocated or neglected . very friendly and eager to help with the selections . overall will definitely be back . however , i would recommend you skip out on the appetizers and go for another entree . the entrees are really on point here . 
french fries like the ones you get at the county fair . . . but with millions of dipping sauces . yes please ! it ' s not the cheapest snack , but a small cone and a few sauces make a delicious ( if unhealthy but you knew that ) meal . the signature sauce with ketchup and onions is delish , and of course almost anything involving mayo is going to be great . not much seating , long line , blah blah , but this is a happy corner of nyc , and worth a trip to fit the craving . 
steer clear , unless you have the appetite of a gerbil . never a good idea to raise prices and decrease the size of the dishes at the same time . 
the food , ambiance and service is great all i wish is for them to have shrimp po boy that will take it to the next level at least to me
hands down the reason why i need to come back to nyc ! remember ! ! ! it ' s the one with the yellow bags . i don ' t even like lamb , and this place makes me crave it . i loved the gyro sandwich so much - my friend ended up giving me hers in place of my chicken and rice . ask for extra white sauce . i don ' t know what that is , but it ' s frigging tasty ! luckily it was sprinkling that night , the line was minimal ) yay ! 
tried to go to the restaurant for brunch after reading the winning remarks here . a waitress ignored us while we stood by the door , then nonchalantly told us the hostess would be with us shortly . once we realized the air conditioner was out , we tried to go sit outside but were ignored . we came back inside and the same waitress once again told us the hostess would be with us . she didn ' t come , so we left . there are far too many good restaurants in park slope to tolerate bad customer service . we wandered down to backyard and had a wonderful grits , a tasty drink called the jamaican firefly and some smack-your-mouth apple pie . 
food was outstanding ! the experience was really fun starting with a greeting in japanese that meant welcome . noodle ramen was very flavorful . however we would ' ve like to have the pork to be cut up in the soup . edamame with the special salt was outstanding . cucumber dish was excellent . green tea sorbet was different . we would return . 
i wish that i could explain how excited i get on wednesday afternoons when i realize that i can get ox tail from tina ' s . . . it honestly the most delicious , succulent slab of red meat a person could ask for ! don ' t let them skimp on the green sauce and make sure to order it with yellow rice . . . it ' s a perfect rainy day meal because it ' s kind of heavy . you must try it ! btw , i ' m eating it right now . . . i think that ' s what inspired me to write them a review
incredible ! some of the best thai food i have ever eaten ! we found a seat without trouble , service was excellent , and the food was a knockout ! plus , our bill was ridiculously low . i was scared to eat out in nyc , but this was less than we might have spent back in san jose . highly recommended ! 
i haven ' t been in the place physically , but im a regular once or twice a week delivery customer . the food is great ! i love the different pasta salads . in terms of portion , your getting more than what you pay for . my only critism is the delivery time during lunch hours . i ' ve worked in similar places in nyc and you always bulk up on delivery drivers during peak hours and during bad weather ( rain and what-not ) . other than that , absolutely love the place and will continue ordering . 
oh what a shame , used to love this place . german potato salad - not german nor a looked or tasted like a potato salad . country ham - not even close , sliced slivers of what almost looked like boiled ham . brisket - so they told me it was . service - slow and slower . N crackers - really ? 
lots of reviews about this place . the menu has been updated and some of the reviews here about those dishes no longer apply . the mango french toast is no more , as well as the adobo chicken . the food here was excellent . i was a little hesitant at first because i ' ve never tried filipino food but i was pleasantly surprised . the bbq chicken shish kabobs are really good . garlicky . spam fries were really good also . try it with the banana ketchup ! for the main meal i had the bistec , which came in a sauce and topped with onions . really , really good . i ' m hispanic and bistec is nothing new to me , but when i ' ve never tasted a bistec seasoned this way . it came with garlic rice which was good on it ' s own , but i added some of the soy sauce which made it orgasmic . they have filipino bears here too . the san miguel was light and went down smooth . not much taste to it . i also tried a red horse which was a little more flavorful and maybe a little darker than the san miguel , but was also really good . i ' m excited about this place . can ' t wait to stop in again for a meal . 
overpriced , spent around N . N tip included and delivery fee from grubhub for N entrees a few appetizers ( no pun intended ) they weren ' t ! and N cans of soda , what was supposed to be a nice end the weekend with a nice dinner turned out pretty badly . calamari was almost burnt , very dark brown , tasteless and soggy , turns out they put it in the box with shredded lettuce to make sure it got soggy . shrimp and eggplant was pretty tasteless and way overcooked . another eggplant dish with garlic was chosen to be steamed but they served me just the steamed eggplant with no sauce . i did get some sauce in a container but was unsure if it was supposed to go to the apps or the steamed eggplant because it tasted nothing like the sauce in my shrimp eggplant dish . plus it was very weird tasting on the not good side of things . had some meat wontons that were pretty nasty tasting . scallions pancakes were soaked in oil and over fried and then sliced into little wedges . all in all , do i have to say anything else ? the delivery guy was very nice and smiling ! probably cause no one else is dumb enough to order that much food from them ! oh , so i only wish good things to all of you who write phony reviews for whatever reason compels you to do so . thanks ! 
food was delish ! the french onion soup dumplings were awesome and not something you see on other menus . if we hadn ' t gotten N apps and entrees i would have eaten the whole bowl . buffalo meatballs were spicy and sophisticated ! my entree was eggplant invotini . nice fresh flavor and it came over thin spaghetti . portion sizes were good . presentation was nice . prices are good too and it ' s byo . my only complaint was that there weren ' t any other customers . it was a thursday night but this place should be much busier . i hope it is on the weekends . it deserves a crowd . i hope to go back soon ! 
if you are looking for quality burger with great service in an ambient setting , look no further ! this is the place ! the short rib slider was delicious and the N oz classic burger was just rightly done and the fries were excellent . the waitress was very friendly and cordial and the service was fast . overall , we had a very good experience . 
best italian food i have ever had ! ! ! i would reccomend this place to anyone and everyone . sadly i live in florida and can not dine here more often . i dream about their wild game meatballs ( which is something i normally would never order ) lol . along with their amazing food the service was nothing short of amazing . i will be going back to this place without a doubt when ever i visit ny again ! ! 
disappointed us tonight . . very bad customer service . . . don ' t even plan on going before a devils game unless you get there three hours before . . . hostess will lie to you about wait times , only to never be seated . . . eating arena food tonight . . . never again ! 
jacob ' s pickles is delicious ! i live in the neighborhood and finally walked in and i ' m happy i did . since then , i ' ve been there N times in the couple weeks for dinner . i also recently tried highly recommend their brunch ( i ' ve tried it once ) . the french toast with strawberries is to die for . the cocktails are also very delicious and many are made with freshly squeezed lemonade . to add to the experience , the management is very friendly and accommodating . if you haven ' t had the chance to try jacob ' s pickles , you really should . you will not be disappointed ! 
still now i have no complain for this place -as they gave me according to my need serving for me long . so how can a settle them and leave them without putting any review . each day many people making purchase at here but they didn ' t leave even a single review -whether the service good or bad should reveal for the next consumers . 
initially seemed to be a tourist trap , but very interesting products and good service . stopped at the gelato place and got the hazelnut , straciatella , and cappucino . yum ! 
beware of overcharging ! worst racket ever . got N drinks from one bartender and the price was N . N , got the same N drinks from another bartender and the price was now N . N ! ! ! at a different bar inside , play N the bartender did the same thing . we called her out on charging N . N for a N . N beer and gave her the option of getting a manager or taking money out of her tips . she chose the Nnd option . 
i took my mother to ai fiori for a mother ' s day prix fixe pre- theater lunch . the ambiance is lovely , comfortable and serene . service is impeccable , charming , knowledgeable and never overbearing . our lunches were delicious , i had the cod ( melt in your mouth ) and my mother had the beef ( extremely tender cuts as well ) . the tastes were complex but not overwhelming . portion sizes were perfect oh and my gnocchi appetizer was splendid . desserts were rich but not heavy . 
overpriced , meager portions and overall average quality sandwiches . 
not much to say besides its great ! well worth the wait . . . . . . my tip is to call ahead and just walk in and pick up the pie . staff is very nice and pie is always as good as the last ! ! 
this place used to be my favorite thai restaurant but lately the service has gone bad . the food was horrible don ' t know if the chefs have changed but the food did not taste right . we had to send the dish back twice because it was just unedibly salty . the server never paid attention and we had to wait for awhile before he took our order . went again thinking maybe the chef had a bad day the last time but the food still tasted bad , not like it used to months before . too bad this was my favorite thai restaurant but no longer is . . . 
cheap pizza cheap ingredients ! 
order takeout based on previous yelp reviews and was very pleased . no veggie moussaka , unfortunately , but pleased with the greek salad , fava bean salad , tzatzki , and hummus . didn ' t care for the whole wheat pita at all -- very dry ! would certainly try them again . 
how can you go wrong with mamoun ' s ? you can ' t ! this is the place my husband my craves every time we are in the city . we ' re both vegetarian and the falafel and baba ganoush sandwiches hit the spot ! you can ' t beat the N price for a hot falafel sandwich . the hot sauce is super hot so be careful ! we usually buy a bottle to bring back home with us and a little goes a long way ! the line moves quick and the staff is friendly considering they are trying to move the line as fast as possible . 
this one ' s simple an amazing setting right at the water ' s edge balances out average food . if you want waterfront seating , this is one of the only games in town . usually a few time a summer it ' s worth wandering down . 
great place ! warm lighting and a wide variety of music . from classics to current favorites . but that ' s just the start . be it the bar or a nice booth . i felt real relaxed . i grabbed a stout from a nice seasonal draughts menu . nice food menu as well . i am hooked on chicken tenders rapped in forest ham and cordon bleu . yum ! ! the worse thing is the owners had another restaurant called swift half . it was closed recently . will be deeply missed . so good dog will continue to hold a warm place in my heart . 
you ' re going to wait but the food is absolutely amazing . these guys take pride in individual ingredients and it ' s more about the quality of said ingredients then it is about the dishes ( though they are stellar ! ) . to top it all off the bang for your buck is out of this world . these guys always have a wait , i have no idea why they don ' t charge more because they totally could ! 
when walking in terryin , me and my bf were greeted by the waitress . she took us to our table and seated us . the only issue we have with this place is that there ' s no air conditioner ( that ' s why i gave it N stars ) ! i ordered seaweed salad , N maki roll , N specialties rolls . the seaweed salad was the " bomb " , it tastes really good ! but the maki roll tastes very plain , nothing spectacular . but the N special rolls ( sorry can ' t remember their names by heart , but i think one was the volcanoe roll ) were awesome ! my bf had ordered the general tso ' s shrimp and he loves it ( he ' s a picky eater so for him to say something like that , it got to be good ) . their pricing is great , at least is way cheaper then most restaurant . i would love to go back to terryin again , but since i lived in delco i can ' t ( i will definitely go there if i happens to be in south philly for errands ) 
the ole chowder pot is showing it ' s age . getting a little seedy and please replace the rugs . the smell of puke and people is getting a little too ripe . too bad because the food is excellent . best stuffing i ' ' ve had . . fried is awesome . oh yeah , put a couple extra waitstaff on , will you ? they work so hard but just can ' t keep up ! not rushing back ' til i hear of a makeover . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
i was here for restaurant week i have to say the experience was very pleasant professional . i ' d def . recommand this place to my ppl would love to come back for special occasion ! food-very delicious beautiful . 
great staff , the place is really comfortable , and the ambiance is perfect . went there for thanksgiving dinner and had a good time , relaxed and with great food . 
we live down the street and strolled into this restaurant randomly the week it opened . the food is amazing . the staff is friendly and will hang out and take a sip of your byob wine with you and go out of the way to accomodate . my boyfriend and i did their N-course valentine ' s day dinner and we had the place to ourselves . my favorite restaurant for dinner in williamsburg . 
read the reviews , and had the lamb burger and the greek fries . the burger did not disappoint , but the greek fries were not something that can be shared by two people and were a bit dry i think a sprinkling of olive oil would go a long way . service was nice , food came a bit slow , but the lamb burger really was good enough to get past some of the other points . beer decent . 
i love this cute comfy place . i went tonight on a rainy night . perfect . candle light , great food , couscous , rice , morrocan meets mediterranean , a nice glass of red wine , and cozy cozy cozy . very attentive service . i love this cute restaurant . 
very good calazones
i ' ve eaten here four times . the first two experiences were really phenomenal . the plantains and salsa appetizers are crispy and delectable . the ceviche was fresh and very tasty . the steak was tender and juicy . however , the last two times i went here i was quite disappointed . both times the steak was not cooked to our specifications medium rare was well done this was confirmed by our waitress . also , the service was much slower than could be reasonably expected from the number of patrons . and she had quite the ' tude . despite the vixen and mismatched order , i would still recommend this place with four stars as the quality of the food and our first experiences left a strong imprint . though , if the service doesn ' t improve , it may be just an erasure next time . 
great italian food ! owner is extremely pleasant and if you do not like something , he sends it back with no problem ! the lounge upstairs is nice for cocktails . there is happy hour now from N-Npm mon-thurs . 
awesome crepes ! ! ! my favorites are the pbj and the strawberry jam with mascarpone . on top of that the chef owner provides excellent service . go here and you won ' t be disappointed ! 
great , fresh food and interesting characters who serve you . only thing keeping me from going N stars is the cleanliness of the eating area . olaf , wash the walls down once in a while ! 
the italian sausage with provolone is easily the best sandwich in the city . was a frequent customer when we lived there . my biggest complaint about moving to pittsburgh was leaving dinic ' s behind . i frequently travel to nyc for business , and my preferred travel route to fly to philly , stop at dinic ' s , then catch a train to nyc . a sandwich that can alter travel plans like that must be good . all of their sandwiches are terrific without , but the sausage is the top . the pulled pork italian is second in my book . 
had lunch here today with a co-worker . she ordered the crab cake sandwich which she said was delicious . i had the salmon sandwich which was okay , nothing to write home about . our server josh was really nice and helpful . 
this place really is a hidden gem . from the looks of the place you would probably be discouraged to eat there . it ' s in this old crappy strip mall next to a dirty pathmark and k-mart and the inside of the place is nothing to write home about but the pizza and food is amazing ! i ' ve had all different types of pizza and sandwiches from there and have never been disappointed . their large pies are huge and in the same style as a traditional new york slice . the crust is amazing and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crispiness and they never skimp on the toppings . they also make amazing garlic knots and cheesesteaks . if i had to find something to complain about it is only that their menu is pretty limited and they don ' t deliver , otherwise perfect . highly recommend you go here , especially for take out . 
went to cuban pete ' s for dinner with another couple - told the wait was N minutes . N minutes still no table , however a blond with her group got seated after she was told there was a N hour wait . when i spoke to the manager , he told me " it was his restaurant , he could do what he wanted and it ' s a free country " . we got seated immediately when my husband wen to speak to the manager ( same guy ) . we ate here , food was not as good as we remembered from last time , service was good ( daniel was our server ) but we will not be going back due to mr . it ' s my restaurant . be sure i ' ll be spreading the news of his disrepectful attitude . . . 
tried a simple pulled pork sammich from here . plain jane - no cheese , no peppers , no sauce . . . those were extra . man , they stack the meats on nicely ! but really it should come with bbq sauce , gravy or something to kick it up because it was a little on the bland and frankly , dry side . 
very reasonably priced ! i ordered the spicy basil noodles with chicken and god they were super . not actually spicy , but very yummy . the noodles were flat so they made the dish very easy to eat with chopsticks . my first thai experience went amazing ) ! 
very excited that this place is open again ! went on sunday for brunch . service was pretty bad . . . lots of confusion over the menu . i ' m hoping they ' ll get back into the groove soon . but , the food was excellent ! ! ! looking forward to updating my review soon . 
just you thought paninis are so beginning of this century but the folks at il bambino tirelessly mastered the craft . il bambino ' s paninis are timeless and keeping it real . the vegetarian paninis are designed for carnivore like me ! ! ! amazing wine list and beer selection ! ! ! 
an excellent impression and experience , and start of the evening totally destroyed by the last two steps and failure from management to make it right , and i may add that there is even some misleading advertisement in the game . let me start by telling you that i have advised N , N , N start hotels and restaurant in customer service and marketing , internationally so i do have some experience . yes , sorry " max " while you have a very good reputation i think that more training is needed to keep your " style " . my wife and i read in the local paper that we have the opportunity to choose from several restaurants and dine out for N per person and taste the some special selection of foods . i called ahead and asked what is on the menu and i was advised about the different choices . upon making reservation we dressed accordingly in " style " and headed to one of the " best " restaurants in hartford . all started very well a very nice and elegant restaurant with professional staff and appearance . we were given the normal menu and the special one , for N and we ordered . after we ordered i asked the waitress what is the extra N dollars in the bottom of the menu , she smiled and told me well it is there to make you aware that you will be charged extra N dollars if you order steak . in my book this is misleading advertisement ( like the small prints that you do not read in most cases , or misleading ) . no problem i get over it quickly . in the special menu they also suggested some wines and i can tell you as a N year veteran member of the wine tasting society the red wine was so terrible that my wife even the next day was sick from it . let me tell you about the excellent salad and the tasty food , both of them were brought to us in a very short time , it was presented very elegantly and both the fish and the steak tasted superbly . so we were having an awesome time , and felt good . however after finishing the food the desert was not coming so after N minutes i went to the waitress and she brought it out right away , and it looked and tasted exceptional . next we wanted to pay and got the check but could not leave since the waitress was not around , after waiting for another N minutes , we went to the reception area and told them that sorry but i refuse to wait anymore time and i want to pay . a few minutes later an apology was given to us by both the waitress and the management and we were left to leave the place feeling frustrated and angry . later we went to dance and had an excellent time , and even got to meet some very nice italian people at the club . bela b . jr . west hartford
the coffee is pretty bitter but it ' s served with a square of chocolate but the real reason to go here and the only reason i do is for the absolutely sublime avocado toast . like great art it ' s often the combination of simple elements into something transcendent and that is what the avocado toast is . it ' s worth suffering the horribly overroasted coffee for . 
i bought several cookie trays for christmas and not only are they some of the best cookies i have ever had . . the old school italian ' s i gave them too were also extremely happy to enjoy the delicious cookies . they were so good , i went back on christmas eve and picked up N more ! easy in and out and i now have a new christmas tradition ! ! thanks you ! buon natale a tutti ! 
first time i was here , during a week day , was good . good atmosphere , quick service , and the food was fine . who goes to diners for the food , anyways ? went on a recent sunday morning and not only were my wife and i ignored while the wait staff walked right past us at the front door , but people who arrived after us were coming through the back door and getting seated . when i inquired about the situation , the waitress told me that it ' s really up to us to get a seat . so we left . 
when on vacation ate here for breakfast several times . wished there was one by me . the crepes were delicious . the fillings really fresh . can ' t wait to come back to burlington and eat here again
wow so i don ' t know where to begin , i was so disappointed with the service . for starters our waitress brought us burnt ass mashed potato pizza . i tried one bite and knew i can ' t force myself to finish . i sent it back and they gave me a new one that was much better . pizza was ok but my wife loves it , so if u like mashed potatoes then you will probably like it too . anyway back to service , the waitress never asked us for a refill on water and it wasn ' t like she didn ' t see us as we were sitting right in her path to and from the order station . i finished early and sat and relaxed thinking my waitress might see were done and so she could ask if we need a box and the check . after N mins i just flag her down and ask . i ' m so irritated at this point i decide i ' m gonna leave a small tip . to end this great experience she hands my money in a dirty cup with loose change on the bottom . by dirty i mean old beer was all over my coins and bottom of my bills . so furious at this point i took all the tip and then my wife left her N dollars . which is not what i wanted but can ' t fight the wife . go to pepes if u want a more casual setting . bar is a young immature crowd at night . 
we wanted something special but low key , for father ' s day , and we absolutely made the right decision coming to da andrea this evening . so that makes two nights of two great italian meals ! the food here is excellent . i had salmon with sun dried tomatoes . there was even enough for my lunch tomorrow . my dad had the cavatelli with shrimp , and other people at our table had the saffron fettuccini , chicken paillard , braciola , and a few other assorted pasta dishes . the true star of the evening , however , was the le tigelle , fresh baked flat buns served with imported prosciutto . oh lordy , lordy , these buns were so good , i felt like they were melting in my mouth . we actually ordered several appetizers , but the flat buns were eaten first , and everyone stared wistfully at the empty plate until our waiter finally took it away . by the way , our busboy was super sweet too ! the coffee at da andrea is so good , and he was kind enough to give us all the information about where they purchase it in brooklyn . one other nice note about da andrea , is that we got to sit outside , which really made the whole night a pleasure . 
this is such a great place . easy to find on bleecker in the heart of the village , it ' s a great option for those nights when you ' re just not sure what you want . not only is the food excellent , well prepared and flavorful , but it ' s gluten free ! you can even get gluten free bread here ! it ' s like heaven for anyone with a true gluten allergy . the only thing you ' ll need to beware of is the crowd . it ' s not a large space , and you can feel a bit in top of one another , so it ' s not the new option for a night when you want some privacy for a good conversation . you ' re going to hear everyone around you and vice versa , but for a casual night of homey , but interesting food , this is a great place . 
it is a very , very good local place . open and well designed . modern , fresh ans sophisticated food , good wine and very friendly stuff . i go there often and prefer it lo the sister restaurant little owl because it is more spacious , cheerful and bright . fried oysters are very good . 
in the a e biography of my life , they will show stills of me at balthazar throwing my head back and laughing with a glass of wine in my hand looking totally happy ( and hopefully on a good-hair day ) . balthazar is one of my favorite restaurants , not only in new york but anywhere . my friend bruce took me there for the first time years ago , after whetting our appetites with gimlets and mac cheese at the soho grand . last weekend we tried to figure out exactly when it was when we were there together . " um , N years ago , N ? " " hmmmmmm . . . . i can ' t really remember , i think we were kind of drunk . " " we were always kind of drunk back then " " ha ha , yeah , those were the days . " " wait , i know ! " " what ? " " it was the same day i bought those prada buckle shoes ! " " omigod those are my favorites " " i know ! " " ok , so i got those N years ago " " N years ago it is . " so N years later , i decide it ' s time for us to go again . saturday morning , i woke up my dear friend bruce , who was hosting me for the millionth time after i my flight got canceled due to weather ( ugh ) . . . by jumping on the bed and saying " guess . where . we . are . going . to . brunch . today ? " big grin . ( groan ) " where ? " " balthazar ! " " no way ! " " yes , i scored a reservation , so get dressed and look good . we ' re catching the train in half an hour " . fast-forward to us arriving at balthazar after braving the lirr , penn station , and the slush and ice of the city streets . ahhhhhhhhh . entering balthazar , you are in paris , new york , and heaven all at the same time . the place is buzzing with waiters and patrons , and it has that old-world feel of an institution that has been there for years . the high ceiling and huge tilted mirrors on the wall are incredible , and reflect the many tables and booths of all varieties of people hovering over wonderful plates of food and engrossed in conversation . for starters , bruce ordered his favorite dish of all time , the goat cheese tart . oh my , it was so good and creamy , with caramelized onions adding to the richness of the dish . garnished with house-made sundried tomatoes and a smidge of tapenade , you could easily make a light meal of it with a soup or salad . simply perfect . i had the steak tartare . best ever . generous portion of the most tender meat , perfectly seasoned , with lightly toasted crostini and a mixed green salad . god . i could eat this dish by the bucket . bruce had the beef stroganoff for his main . talk about comfort food - home-made broad noodles and butter-soft beef in a rich creamy sauce . i would definitely recommend it on a chilly winter ' s day . i had the grilled trout - entirely upon the recommendation of the server . how she convinced me to eat a fish that i normally don ' t care for is beyond me , but her description sounded so delicious that i could not resist . and she was entirely , entirely correct . the fish is grilled to a crisp , with a balsamic reduction on top , all sitting on a bed of baby lentils and vegetables . i enjoyed every delectable bite . everything at balthazar is always wonderful , down to the bread and butter . there is a reason it is such a popular hot spot - not because of trendiness , but because their food is fantastic and the wait staff is excellent . you will sit close to your neighbor , but enjoy it . we ended up meeting a wonderful couple who we talked to for a full hour after finishing our meal - the perfect cap on our experience . like the ultimate pair of prada shoes , dining at balthazar is something special to treasure . a bientot ! p . s . the cookbook is available for sale , and features many of their classic recipies including the goat cheese tart . 
i ' m such a fan ! ! ! i tried this place about a month ago , and i ' ve been back at least five times . their boiled dumplings ( N small N large ) are better than most places ' fried dumplings . very flavorful , nicely chewy , yummy sauce . i also love their peanut noodles ( N ) . they ' ll make the dish with wheat noodles or rice noodles . both are good , but i prefer the chewier wheat noodles . admittedly their dumplings are double the price of prosperity , but they ' re also Nx the quality . lastly , the ladies who work the counter are super nice . 
food good . service good . crazy busy on a friday . we were jammed in . lots of people . maybe go very early or very late . 
amazing burgers ! byob . chill out great restaurant with no pretentiousness . loved it . thanks , yelp ! ( we were just driving through ) 
a friend of mine raved about this restaurant and how authentic the food is . i had the pa-yao beef noodles soup and to be honest , it was rather simplistic in flavor . for a N entree , the ratio of noodle to soup was unjustified . perhaps , if i had tried something else like the pad thai my friend had ordered , then maybe it would have been more satisfying . as for the ambience and customer service , the restaurant was intimate and homey and the staff was very accommodating . 
clamari salad is sooo good . i love their cocktails too ! i always take my family friends here whenever they visit the town . its one of my favorite places in philly ! ) 
went here after attending " sleep no more " the food and the service were great . the owner was there and was very welcoming and the waitress was enthusiastic and provided great service with good direction . the food was wonderfully prepared and while the place is small you felt at home and not crowded . they take great pride in the place and it is well worth the diversion from the beaten path . 
a traveler ' s delight ! my wife and i were heading up i-N to see my brother in mystic and saw a billboard for this family restaurant which came to our delight as we were planning to stop at mcdonalds for another greasy meal . when we arrived we were greated by a friendly staff . the waiter promtly came over to the table and took our order as we were famished . it was lunch time so i had their tuna club and my wife had their steak and cheese the works . both of our meals were amazing and quick . i think we were there for no longer than a N N hour . 
all the other N star reviews are all spot on . for fresh , authentic , delicious italian , you cannot go wrong at bianca . . . and the prices are reasonable ! 
overall a N for me . based on beer selection alone , more like a N . their selection of craft beers is extensive and exciting ! ! when my local friend suggested we go for happy hour i was indifferent and rolled along . from the outside , i was definitely expecting more a divey vibe , but the place is really nice inside with a decent bar and high tops . the staff was very friendly and conversational . their menu seemed alright , we only ordered a couple munchies . but the tomato and mozzarella was great with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and pita bread . their drink menu had lots of specialty cocktails , martinis and beer cocktails too . i wanted the dirty flower sooooo badly but they didn ' t have any wheat beer on tap so i ' ll have to return and have it another time ! 
the decor here is fantastic , and the service is great . as a whole , i am a huge fan of perry street , although it is a little bit out of the way . i think i still like jojo and jean-georges better in terms of food , but as a whole this place is still really good ! definitely worth trying ! 
service was horrible but food was outstanding
i have to totally disagree with the guy who left the latest review . mccrossen ' s has become my favorite neighborhood spot since moving there a few months ago . the first night we checked it out , my roomate and i sat at the bar and struck up a conversation with the bartender . he was super friendly and even offered us N drinks on the house as a welcome to the neighboorhood gesture . they have a great beer selection on tap and the food is great for a pub . it looked so good that night that we went back the following week to check it out for ourselves . some favorites are the sheeps milk ricotta with warm flatbread , the calamari and the wings . the wings are sooo good . a good mix of typical bar food ( burgers , wings , fries ) mixed with a few surprises ( ricotta , pork chop , pasta ) . a great place to grab a drink with a friend , catch a game , or even bring the family for a nice dinner . the atmosphere is so warm and cozy . this place is definitely the cheers of fairmount . always a good mixed crowd in there and the staff is so friendly . 
don ' t worry . if you ' re planning on going to blue ribbon for dinner , everything is fine . the food is fine , the decor is fine , ok the music is terrible but that ' s made up for by the service , which is a bit better than fine . if you manage to avoid the toddlers ' dinner that takes place on the early side of the evening , and the kind of creepy , near-dark late hours ( when they really pump that house music ) your experience should be well , fine . i ' ve eaten here more than a couple times over the last few years as i live nearby . so i ' ve eaten or seen many of the dishes they have . all fine . nothing special . of course , everything ' s a few dollars more expensive than every other restaurant in brooklyn , so they must think they ' ve got something going on . but there ' s nothing particularly interesting or new about the menu , nothing seasonal , organic , local , etc , it just seems they ' ve thrown as many dishes as they can fit onto their menu in the hopes that something might stick . i imagine that it was sort of a cool novelty back when they opened however many years ago to serve things like fried chicken and bone marrow and oysters . well , there are plenty of places that serve those things now , and do it better . overall , i ' d have to say that the quality of the food has been in decline for several years . you wonder if the owners are paying attention . of course they must be , because somebody is bothering to raise the prices every year or so . don ' t get me wrong , i can afford to eat there . it ' s just a question of value . just can ' t do it any more . 
well if there is N or negative stars then this place deserves it badly - ) the wait staff has absolutely no smile on their face . the food is N or N stars but the big issue is cleanliness . if north brunswick food inspector is doing his her job properly this place would be closed down yesterday ! let me tell you however , the hostess was the grumpiest i have ever seen . she had no smile and never spoke a word with any one . she took a piece of b ' day cake and eating it hiding it . i don ' t mind she taking the cake but not sure why she was hiding the cake as she ate it . time to eat food . . each every plate was so unclean , had so much left over food layers from previous N different parties that i decide to pass the dinner . so next i said let me eat some milk sweets . . the sweets served tasted made with slimy sweet milk . clear sign that sweets has been sitting in the fridge for N or more days . my family member who ate the food had major stomach ache . more over i also saw the manger was looking at his watch since the time party started . . . he was trying to shut the party down as soon as he could . so don ' t go there if you really want to enjoy your party . n . brunswick food inspector or some police officer if you are reading pls shut down this place and save some lives please , before some one gets seriously food poisoned again ! ! ! 
the plan wasn ' t to meet at cr , but my friend had a pa , and due to proximity cr became the destination . the smokey tequila cocktail i had was really good , and there were a few other drinks on the menu i ' d like to try in the future . overall scene was chill and the bartender was cool . pa ' s are always an adventure and in this case it led us to a great new bar ! ------------------------- poop attack
tried once , not really good . 
awesome food , drinks and service ! this was our Nrd trip to lucha cartel . we were really excited about a new mexican restaurant opening up in the neighborhood and this place is awesome . although the service was a little slow when they first opened they definitely have seemed to figure it out by now . our dinner and drinks were all brought out in a timely manner , and the waitress was super nice and helpful . decor is super cool , styled with luchador themed purple wallpaper ( how cool ! ) , crazy paintings , and a super cool bar with crazy pipes coming out of it . here are my food and drink recommendations . . . mojitos - they ' re a must have with mexican food and made perfectly here ! beer - lots of options on the revolving taps , they always have a great selection tacos - pork or fish , i highly recommend them both fajitas - delicious and simple , won ' t leave you feeling stuffed which is nice ( imho ) burrito - mmmmmm , any combination is delicious
i enjoyed my meal here although nothing was really great about it . the menu is solid with lots of good choices . the decor is cozy and fun . service is fine . i found it pretty expensive once you add up all the small plates . i didn ' t find it compelling enough for a return visit . 
first , shout out to our server , lucy ! she was attentive and sweet ! this was our first time at this prime N . huge fans of the nh prime , we peeked in to see a larger version of the nh space . the bar was brimming on this friday around N pm . a few of the booths were filled in the restaurant and after experiencing the same winning food here , we expect that more will come . only thing missing was the young yale crowd . our faves , the lamb and honey truffle burgers ! the draft beer list is bar none ! this burger joint will give five guys and wayback a run for their money ! 
awesome ramen . way too popular now . 
the food is good , the atmosphere convivial , and evokes the atmosphere of a british pub . butnot for anyone over the age of about N . virtually all of the seats are very low and have no back support whatsoever . after dining there with a friend , i required chiropractic treatment and massage therapy for the next three days to repair the damage to my back . if you are N years or older - " beware the spotted pig " ! 
the man who makes a success of an important venture never wails for the crowd . he strikes out for himself . it takes nerve , it takes a great lot of grit but the man that succeeds has both . anyone can fail . the public admires the man who has enough confidence in himself to take a chance . these chances are the main things after all . the man who tries to succeed must expect to be criticized . nothing important was ever done but the greater number consulted previously doubted the possibility . success is the accomplishment of that which most people think can ' t be done . -c . v . white with the above statement , i agree with the fact that with success , critics come as well . critic is fine but its totally different when it comes to haters , yes haters . . . it ' s been N years i have known himalayan yak . and every time i go there i enjoy every moment . himalayan yak has always given me an essence of being in homely environment with twist of technology and the foods are marvelous , i have literally tried everything , from goat intestine to thali to chicken lolipop , u name it . . presentations are good as well . . i remember once in my village , i had a buckwheat rice on a slab of a stone . . and nobody cared about if its sanitary enuf , or if its oily , greasy . . life is simple out there . and out of sudden in america they started complaining that food is oily and this and that bla bla bla . . as a matter of fact , i think ( my perspective ) haters are complaining because the name " himalayan yak " represents so many region , culture , tribes , cast and people , that everyone is expecting the food to represent their preference and type . it ' s a fusion between cultures , and with change comes inventions . enjoy the versatility of food rather than whining about oil and spices . the foods are authentic , you know it and i know it too . you know ( my perspective ) probably this people ( haters ) are some other business ( restaurant ) owner whose business has been nailed by yak . they couldn ' t confront the fact , so they are showing their anger frustration through virtual world ( internet ) and leaving reviews like " ohh . . found a hair in my food . . . the food is greasy uff so oily . . . the food is spicy . . . " brother back home , the foods are N times spicier and oilier , i bet you didn ' t have any problem there because you were in nepal tibet india . and now suddenly you are whining about few drops of oil . i took bunch of my american friends , polish , jamaicans and they all loved it . the fact that hurts most is our own people are complaining and leaving such a bad review . shame on you guys . the reason for saying all of this is , i support the truth . and the truth is himalyan yak is a great restaurant with mouth watering delicious cuisine , which satisfies every inch of my stoamch and my mind . it takes a while to get a food , i agree . . . . but all that waiting is all worth it . don ' t you agree that it takes time to make fresh good things , . all dish are prepared fresh , i will wait to have a freshly made cuisine rather than rush to a fastfood restaurants ( pre-cooked food and store for the day that how fast food works ) , how did i know all this ? the staffs were so friendly and generous enough , that the manager himself gave me a brief on how it ' s prepared ( i kept asking ) and you can tell it with your palate , taste the difference hmmm m hungry already . the " live band " is another smart touch , i would say . you see renowned artist like firoj dai ( N ad ) , singing and mingling with people . the band is awesome and the music just rocks . most of all himalayan yak rocks and has been rocking ny for past N -N yrs . . . and it always feels good to see my country being represented . god bless himalayak yak and god bless to all who made it possible . go to himalayan yak and experience the flavors of warmth , joy , and happiness . 
i ' ve been here so many times and can ' t believe i haven ' t reviewed it yet ! well here it is . i will continue to come back here even after i move away from nyc . the quality of the food is so incredible ! i ' ve had the turkey burger - excellent . the cobb salad - amazing . and today , i had the soup and sandwich combo which was spectacular . ( it was a fancy grilled cheese with an incredible tomato soup . ) the consensus on our lunch was that we didn ' t want it to end . also a plus the place is very gay friendly . i ' d love to shake the chef ' s hand . 
great food for the price . you may have to endure a long line though but it is definitely worth it . my recommendation is to try the lamb gyro over rice . you can also share with a friend . the serving is quite big . this is my favorite spot to go to for a cheap and quick bite after work . 
just back from pio pio uws . . . decent and definitely worth another visit . on a friend ' s recommendation tried , what she called " the uh-mayzing avocado salad " . meh . . . . nice . . . but meh . . . easily made at home . nothing special . what " made " the salad was re-dressing it with the famous green sauce . that sauce is heavenly . i ' d eat my flip-flops if they came smothered in that green sauce . the mixed ceviche was a generous and delicious portion , with unusual corn-based garnishes that i really enjoyed . the menu said it was going to come on a " bed of sweet potato " . . . it did not . . . it had a hunk of boiled ( ? ) sweet potato on the side . . . not a bed thereof . the fun surprise of the evening was the peruvian-chinese fried rice . salty , deliciousness with hunks of crispy deep-fried chicken , steak and shrimp . however . . . check your bill before you pay . i did not . i think i ' ve been overcharged N for the rice . . . even after you add the extra N for the shrimp . not a good feeling . ambiance is fun but loud . if you want to have an intimate or even normal-voiced conversation , pio pio ain ' t the place for it . the service was fast and furious and efficient , but lacked any charm on the part of the server . the busboys and other staff were much friendlier and actually gave off the warmth and charm that the server ought also to have had . nb they take all cards , except discover . 
great food . will definitely go back . the staff is friendly . its a busy place so we waited for the food a little longer . portions are good . 
great place in brooklyn when your craving ramen ! pork bone ramen broth is great and don ' t forget to ask for the garlic chili oil which gives it that extra kick , the kale salad is great also . i recommend this place ! ! 
the greatest pizza in the world ! ! ! it pays to be a grimaldi when you go to grimaldi ' s . we didn ' t have to wait in line the service was excellent . love all the staff the host ! the gelato cart outside with spumoni was so yummy after enjoying the most delicious pizza pie i ' ve ever had in my life ! i love grimaldi ' s ! ! ! 
the best pan pizza west of the hudson river ! the grandma pie is awesome and a huge hit when we bring it to parties or family gatherings . 
i made reservations for perry st with much anticipation . having dined at several other jean george establishments i had come to expect a certain level of service and culinary excellence - but was extremely disappointed . i had planned a special birthday experience and it turned into disaster . everything was a mis-step , from the long wait for our pre-dinner drinks , to the fact that our server didn ' t bring the wine for the first course of our " wine pairing meal " until we had one bite left of the first course and simply placed the wine on the table and sheepishly walked away knowing she was late ( . . . . last time i checked a wine pairing means you are supposed to enjoy the wine with the meal as you eat it . . . not as a means of washing down the first course after you eat it ) . . then they couldn ' t get it right after that , none of the other pairings came on time , the Nrd course took forever , the broccoli rabe was soggy and overcooked , the special desert was overly-chocolate and dry ( i ' ve had better treats at an elementary school bake sale ) . this was supposed to be a birthday celebration and we had made our discontent known with the manager - to which she said she didn ' t know it was a birthday celebration - it wasn ' t " in their system " ( even though when they called to confirm the reservations the restaurant confirmed it was a birthday dinner ) . . . . . well when the coat check person couldn ' t find my coat and i had to rummage through their coat closet myself the manager asked for my phone and she pulled up my reservation on the computer . . . oh - wouldn ' t you know on the reservation screen it clearly stated birthday celebration . so now the manager lied right to my face . . . . . absolutely will never go back . . . . and for over N i ' ve had better dining experiences at olive garden for N . . . . . 
the alfie ' s burger is excellent ! probably the best one i have had in the city so far . the service was slowish but it was just recently opened when we went . i will definitely go back for that burger . 
the first couple times i came here ( over a year ago ) it was amazing but when i went recently , it was an entirely different experience and overall pretty meh . i don ' t know whether they are under new ownership or something but robataya has definitely gone downhill . i was sad to see that some of my favorite dishes are gone in favor of other dishes that seem less japanese . i guess it ' s still fun if you sit at the counter . the guys behind the counter really do know what they are doing . unfortunately , the rest of the servers in the table seated area don ' t seem to know much about japanese food or the menu items . to top off the night of mediocre food , our tea at the end of the meal was forgotten and then , when we asked , brought to us lukewarm . such a bummer . i really used to love this place . 
i really don ' t know what happened here . this was my go-to spot in fishtown for the past N years , but unfortunately it seems like food quality has really fallen off over the last N months . they seem to be trying a few different things with the food , but nothing is really working for me . otherwise , they do have a pretty great beer list and the sandwiches are always fairly solid . they serve a respectable burger but nothing in comparison to a few of the other new local spots . as for music , this is still my favorite venue in the city . amazing sound . great atmosphere . great sight lines . great beer . 
very good pizza . crust is good and you can tell the ingredients ( especially the cheese ) is fresh . not the best i ' ve ever had but definitely better than bland grimaldi ' s . 
food was fine , service was poor . i was part of a party of more than N , called and made reservations more than two weeks before the visit . when we arrived the hostess treated our group rather rudely , and the same with the waitress . when making reservations , we specifically asked to have separate checks for each person , with gratuity added . the hostess said no problem . the waitress could not have been ruder regarding this matter and absolutely refused to do it . she did split the check into two . if you change it from one check to two , why not just make the party happy ? i didn ' t ask my group but with a separate checks her tip would have been a done deal , the rude service sealed it for me . 
excellent food , very good wine , great atmosphere , and really good host , all extremely reasonably priced . 
leave the gun take the garlic . when it comes to family style home cooked italian food , as if there is any other way to put those words together , you either got it or you don ' t . don peppe ' s got it and in a big way . they have been at this location for N years , and any night you go you will over hear someone talking about playing cards there in the N ' s or being a regular for N , N or N years . people just was to be attached to this place in any way possible . much like the menu , only written on the back wall , you want to be there not to miss anything . start with the clams , then get some more clams , yes they are that good . the salad might be the only thing not to drive home a N , but it is salad , what are ya gonna complain about a N ? the lemon butter chicken is so good , i am drooling now thinking about it . the veal marsala , and the garlic pasta are right there too . you need some bill gates brain to figure out what is better then what . my suggestion is to round up a group of calorie counting , stomach ailment suffering , pickiest eaters you know , head to don peppe ' s and that just means more for you . if you go with anyone close to normal you are going to fight down to the last clove of garlic , and if you are with me it is war . enjoy ! 
vegetarian meatballs with parmesan cream sauce over spaghetti-- i dream about you , my dear sweet friend . 
nice small town feel to this diner . intimate , quiet , old time diner atmosphere . nice menu , but not overwhelming like some diners . we had a western omelet , chicken caesar salad and Neggs with bacon . food was served promptly , hot was hot and salad was cold . nice portions , not tons of food . price was N tip for the three of us . would definitely visit again when in the area . 
lots of hype surrounding this place . i looked forward to going as i ' ve been in the neighborhood for N years and have seen more than a few restaurants retire from this ideal corner . the food overall is probably better than N stars . the watermelon salad was bland old melon pieces i ' ve had better from the deli . however , the duck breast and beet salad were phenomenal . although the server was friendly , she tried to bs us on choosing a wine . if she doesn ' t know a lot about the wines , she should just not offer advice i would appreciate that more . the worst part was the music the space is small , and they were playing very loud hip-hop . the place is more suited for mellow sounds . i ' ll try to go again , but if i get there and hear hip-hop , i ' m leaving . 
this restarurant rocks ! the pork buns are great , but the item to have is the following spicy pork sausage rice cakes - chinese broccoli , sichuan peppercorn , crispy shallots it will change your life . too good . great food and service , can ' t wait to go back . 
i have never written a review before , but my experiences at the grocery have been so great that i feel almost obligated to write one for this restaurant . the menu is interesting , innovative and seasonal , and the food is consistently spectacular . beyond that , the service is fantastic . the staff is professional , accommodating , and just lovely . the combination of the wonderful food , atmosphere , and service makes going to this restaurant into an evening - not just a meal . the grocery is a truly special place . i would recommend it to anyone looking for an intimate and memorable dining experience . 
if you are hungry , don ' t come here for lunch . you will be waiting forever . that is the price you pay when everyone knows how good it is . get there at like N N otherwise the line really picks up . i ' ve had both the ham grinders and the italian combo . both are really fantastic . the staff is very accommodating , they do all the special little things you ask them to do to make your sandwich your own . 
great wait and bar staff with tremendous sanduiche and very good daily specials . karaoke nights on thursday and sunday ! they also have dj playing house music friday and saturday , it ' s like cheers for inwood and as they ' d say in ireland , there ' s always good craic ( great times ) to be had . the best bar in newark . and i can not forget to mention the sangria and the passion fruit caipirinha , just wonderful ! 
brunch menu is not to be missed . eggs with roasted vegetables . grits with biscuits . gluten free bread . go . go now ! ! that is all . 
i had super low expectations for this place and it exceeded them ! the ingredients in my peter ' s special were fresh and the shrimp portions were generous . i was able to make my N noodle dish span into dinner and a boxed lunch for the next day . yes , the service is definitely slower than expected for a place where all they have to do is stir-fry , but the service has always been pleasant when i ' ve gone . it is kind of amusing that a bunch of college-age ( or high schoolers ? ? ) are able to cook a better meal than i can . but in general , i ' m giving it N stars because i don ' t want to get your expectations up either . it is after all stir-fry college dorm food quality . 
this place is just all around goodness ! finally stopped in for lunch and just because their lunch special is N doesn ' t mean that it ' s any less delicious ( much better deal than what you get across the street at yum yum ) . loved their tom yum soup ( super flavorful ) and steamed dumplings . the singapore laksa and pho bo do not disappoint either . will have to try the vietnamese pork chops next time i ' m there . good thing it ' s not closer to my office or else i ' d be there everyday ! 
a bit on the pricey side but if you take people there for work or perhaps first impression , it is a great place . very loungey with great lounge sofas . three-level offer great options from formal dining to chill-out . portions varies . if you get the scallop it ' s literally N for three pieces which would be fine except the bacon stuff at the bottom was super salty . the people that i was with order other things that was fabulous however with greater portion . i guess the seafood was just very small . great wine list and great sangria . don ' t expect to leave without dropping at least N for two though . 
besides the wait , a sweet staff and a spectacular amount of great choices on the menu . great brunch . don ' t miss out on the lemonade ! 
food here very average . wings r the best that ' s about it . beer n patio only plus . wraps not that good and nachos dish will make u shart . owner big dbag
the food is great , but the service is slow but worth the wait . my only complaint would be that the lights are very low and so very dark . the drinks are strong and good . order ms margarita dring and quinoa burger . love the combo ! 
another work regular , and a reasonably solid performer . go for the lobster ravioli , which doesn ' t fall into the trap of being too sweet . i haven ' t been overly excited about the italian places i ' ve been here in philly , so saying la viola is probably the winner may not mean much . but it ' s the winner among the ones i ' ve been to . 
l was going to my bagel heaven for years . it looks like they are under new management now . the new management is much to be desired . you walk in there and they are constantly playing a channel from their own country that no one else watches or wants to watch , but them . there ' s always a language problem w these people . they don ' t want to learn english any better than the little they know now . they think they can run a business w the little english they know and just get by with whatever problems that occurs because of it . i ' ve always gone in there for a taylor ham , egg , cheese on a seeded rye bagel . there ' s this one taller man who can never learn what " seeded rye " is . month after month , he just can ' t learn . there ' s a woman who works on the register that always has to pick out the right bagel for him . when you watch him , he just gives this head shrug ( duh ) and then either asks someone else for what they want or stands around , instead of learning his trade . you ' d figure he would have learned after a few months . no ! you ' d also figure that management would want to know what ' s going on . no way ! he doesn ' t care . nobody is minding the store . last week , i went in and asked for a taylor ham , egg , cheese on a seeded rye but make it a double . again , this guy doesn ' t know what it is . after all the trouble of someone showing him what it is , they they made a single . it was N . N . it was a single . i asked - " this is a double ? " they had to make it over again . today , i went in there for my usual single taylor ham , egg , cheese on a seeded rye . this same guy again didn ' t know what again and held up a N N loaf of toast ( looking like an idiot ) lol ! . i shook my head - " no , that ' s not a seeded rye bagel . i need a seeded rye , seeded rye " . well , they messed up and made a double . the price was N . N . when i asked the girl why this ' double ' ( which i didn ' t order ) is N . N and last weeks double which i ordered was N . N , then all of a sudden , the cook ( who i never spoke to before ) came over and called me a f ' ing a hole . that ' s the last thing you do instead of asking the customer what the problem is . i was going to tell the cook what he told me but i kept my cool and asked him why am i being charged a different price for a double , which i didn ' t order , and last weeks double was N . N . he didn ' t know what to say . he gave me N . N back . there were no apologies . another words , to make a mistake is human , to forgive is not my policy ! what farm did they pick these clowns off of ? what a bunch of low lives ! i ' ll be spreading the word about this place . hopefully , they will go out of business . you don ' t treat your customers like crap especially when it ' s your fault to begin with ! learn english ! watch what goes on in your own business instead of being a hole ' s yourselves ! 
i had a pretty great saturday brunch here . ambiance is conversation worthy , service was good and the menu had a lot of variety . french toast is a notable stand out . i thought it was a bit pricey , but other than that i would definitely return . 
this place serves delicious pho . huge portions and reasonable prices . easy to get there ( you can walk or take the bus ) . service is also great . the food comes almost immediately after you order . lots of noodles in the pho too , which is always a plus . 
very bland , tasteless food . to me , chipotle is better . i got the traditional chicken burrito and the chicken burrito hay carumba - both were bad . i ' ve eaten there and had it delivered and the latter looked bad and tasted even worse . the chicken was dry at some parts and saucy in others , i totally forgot there was onion in there , the guacamole was nothing like guacamole . the only things passable were the beans , the chips , and the rice . it tastes like food that once had flavor , was hosed down with water , and then dried off . 
came for a groupon-inspired brunch during the weekend and were very pleased . using a groupon can be a dicey experience , but ours was shenanigans free - no eye rolling from the servers , no incorrect charges on the bill , no bait-and-switch . surly ' s steak and my enormous omelet were prepared properly , the copious heaps of home fries were liberally spiced with paprika and garlic ( best home fries i ' ve had in a long time ) , and the alcoholic beverages included in the brunch actually had alcohol in them . surly enjoyed his meal so much he ordered a plate of bacon waffles he spotted another diner digging into . surly ' s waffles provided the only speedbump in our dining experience , as they had an odd , crumbly texture he didn ' t enjoy . since i ' ve turned into a real beatch about poor service , i ' m always curious to see how a new establishment handles complaints , and not only was ours handled cheerfully and professionally , service in general was wonderful . our server xana was a total rock star and a little energizer bunny , handling the entire dining room efficiently with only a brief assist from the bartender . we were amazed - she managed to take care of all of us while looking relaxed and upbeat . i hope woodrow ' s takes care of her because she ' s a real gem . if woodrow ' s can keep up the level of service and just fine tune the food a bit , we ' ll be happy to keep returning . 
my boyfriend and i stopped by here last thursday night . we were looking for a new local watering hole . we asked the bartender what her favorite cocktail was and she mentioned the barnyard dance . . . . wow . spicy and delicious ! we asked her for a follow up drink to that which my boyfriend and i thought how can another drink top that ! she indeed recommended another great drink . . . green eggs and hash , certainly not with a power punch kick , but flavorful with a tang . it doesn ' t end there . she mentioned the charcuterie plates where on happy hour . my boyfriend and i said why stop there and let her pick out some cheeses for us . again , all the cheese she picked out were amazingly paired . she gave us great descriptions of them upon serving . then to top it off . N oysters ! ! here ' s the catch , you have to order them by the half dozen or a dozen . the bartender said we can start with half a dozen and if we enjoyed them we can always order another half dozen . we went ahead and ordered a half dozen . superb . she mentioned they were local from long island . my boyfriend and i did not pick out a single thing for ourselves . we were so happy to have a bartender with such great taste . our whole experience was great due to letting go of expectations . we will return ! 
did not meet expectations . service was poor to say the least . we wanted dessert and a glass of wine . since we did not have reservations , we were told the wait was N-N minutes despite the fact that there were many open and clean tables . we ended up sitting at the bar where the service was very slow . menu items are overpriced . chocolate was " ok " but overall experience definitely did not meet expectations . 
over rated food and underwhelming service . the only outstanding dish was the ground meat sausage seasoned with cumin . . . fried zucchini was not bad either . but i have had a much homelier and richer tasting greek food for much cheaper ( greek corner in boston for example ) . the worst part was having to lift our plates from the table every time there was a changeover because the seatings are so uncomfortably crammed ! completely takes away from the beautiful and serene ambiance of this place . save your money for a better tasting meal and experience . . 
went here for my birthday and had an awful experience . the staff was extremely rude to us . before ordering drinks , we asked if the five of us could have separate checks and were told they would only split it N ways because " it ' s a pain in the ass " . meaning , they were N capable of doing it but just didn ' t feel like it . while we talked over how we could pay on one bill ( only N of us had cash ) the waiter angrily told us that he ' d split the check N ways but to note that they don ' t normally do that . we said thank you and waited for our meal . the food was okay but nothing great . he came back and threw the checks on the table . my bill was a little over N and i gave N and asked for change so i could give him a bigger tip . he came back with our bills and threw them down on the table and said " thanks for not tipping , we really appreciate it " and stormed off . i looked down and notice he gave me my change in all coins . really ? we just got our change cards back and you ' re already saying that ? my friends with cards didn ' t even have a chance to fill out the tip portion of the receipt . then , a girl , we assume was the manager , came over to us , bent over and said " did you guys really threaten to leave if we didn ' t split your checks ? " we all looked around confused and told her no because those words never came out of our mouths . she continued to ask us " really ? you didn ' t ? um are you sure ? " we assured her we didn ' t and she goes " well just know its kind of a new york city thing so yeah " in the most sassy tone and walked away . what kind of customer service is that ? 
solid french restaurant in manhattan . the mussels and ribeye were fantastic . also , the four ' as much as you want ' vegetables were quite good . i really liked the couliflower puree . when dining here , remember that it is cash only and byob . 
these mofos be like mamma mia . i be like worda my motha my ninja i love ya i just wanna eat you up . they be like awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww you so sweet i be like i like you too sweetfeet and live happily ever after
pancakes pancakes pancakes . . . any the rest is good too ! 
the food here was good . i personally love love the appetizers . awesome ! ! the atmosphere was great , it had a noce ambiance to it . the service was great and very attentive ! the drinks are really pretty and good too ! ) 
look . it ' s simple . there are three pizza places in the known universe . they are sally ' s , modern , and pepe ' s . they are all in new haven , ct . if you ' ve never eaten at one of these places , you ' ve never eaten pizza . you ' ve probably eaten what ' s passes for pizza by those who do not know , but truly it is not pizza . there is a reason people wait for hours to get into these three restaurant . they are beyond anything you will ever taste . i have toured the world looking for the best pizza , so forget nyc ( though nyc is a distant second place ) , forget chicago ( possibly the worst pizza in the u . s . ) , new haven is the pizza capital of the world , and these are it ' s three palaces . when you go to these places these are the pies to order sally ' s a plain , flo ' s summer special , sliced potato , or just good old fashioned cheese modern eggplant , or cheese pepe ' s white clam and garlic any of these pies will blow your mind . your eyes will roll back in your head and you will think you ' ve seen god . and that is not an exaggeration . 
don ' t listen to the other reviews on this site . how anyone can give pats " king of cheesesteaks " more then one star is beyond me . first off , i placed my order for a cheesesteak with onions and provolone . i am not exaggerating when i say my sandwich was ready in about ten seconds . that ' s right folks , it only took about N seconds for the guy to throw together some dry , tasteless , fatty steak on a cold chewy roll with unmelted overly salty provolone cheese ! ! ! it was so bad i almost couldn ' t even eat it . maybe back in the day this place was great , but now that it ' s been featured on tv and magazines they clearly stopped giving a crap about the taste . don ' t waste your time here , don ' t say you weren ' t warned . 
i really can ' t pin point exactly what it is about this place that i like so much . it could be the wast wine selection . it could simply be the excellent stemware . might be the open kitchen . or the clean comfortable decor . having a great menu is a big plus . there is so much variety , you can ' t say " it ' s not my kind of food " it ' s perfectly created to accommodate even the pickiest patron . 
cannot put into words how much i love gaia cafe the . pasta and the pizza are amazing and the ingredients taste so fresh . in terms of value for money , gaia is unbeatable , nowhere in manhattan comes close . 
juniper was a lovely lunch haven during my recent trip to ny . a haven because while it ' s definitely small , it ' s also quaint and polite and i didn ' t feel at all as though i was being rushed in and out so that my table could be turned as many times as possible . perhaps the difference between eating lunch and eating dinner or maybe it ' s the difference between eating in manhattan and eating in brooklyn . i don ' t know . but , i do know that i enjoyed the fact that it felt like the restaurant wanted me there for as long as i wanted to be there . ( which , by the way was under an hour . i mean it ' s lunch time you know ? ) the exposed brick insides and chalk menus reminded me of some of my favorite spots in denver and the menu itself reminded me of my delicious childhood in the south with a fancy touch at times . things like the mac and cheese should be devoured . things like the burgers should be savored , especially if it ' s truffled . things like the waffles fries should be at all restaurants that serve any kind of fries . ( what is it about waffling that makes a fry so much better ? i may never know . . . ) this spot is cash only so be prepared for that . and when i say they didn ' t rush us i also mean they were slow to take our order or bring our check so don ' t go if you ' re in a hurry or an impatient person in general . or if you do go at least be prepared for this . all in all if i lived anywhere near this spot you ' d probably see my mug on the regulars check-in board here because it was a damn fine experience . 
my in-laws just got back from their trip to europe , so my wife thought it ' d be a great idea to take them to amada . it was my first time there , so i admit i was a little hesitant . but the experience certainly didn ' t disappoint . it was a perfect place for my in-laws ' european hangover , the service was excellent , too , and not pretentious as i had originally thought tapas places to be . 
so i didn ' t try the sushi . but i had the teriyaki chicken and beef combo , and the seaweed salad . the teriyaki beef tasted like pepper steak crossed with some sort of bastardized cheese steak . the seaweed salad was a little bit of seaweed on top of a mess of iceberg lettuce . i ' ve never seen a seaweed salad with anything other than seaweed . i paid N for a bunch of cheap rabbit food . i won ' t be going back to this joint . 
great lunch menu . i always get broccoli rabe with sausage on the fresh semolina bread . i believe the bread comes from altamura bakery . the food so good , that i had them catering my wedding . 
i ordered for the birthday party and all preparations were amazing , highly recommended for party orders ! ! ! 
i don ' t know a single thing about serbian food hence i can ' t comment of the legitimacy of the food . i enjoyed my food . if you are looking to stuff yourself , it ' s not the best place . i tend to enjoy the right portion of good food . kanafa is the place for it . the service was alright . it was average . they did the basic . the environment was good . liked the decoration and the seats outside . i wouldn ' t go back for anytime soon . they have one page menu , with maybe N items ( excluding drink ) . i might go back for a drink and maybe appetizers though ( during non-meal hour ) . 
perfect ! they ' ve added so much value to spend time and feel great eating out in the neighborhood . we enjoy there food every time we go . the atmosphere is calm and compassionate . the endive salad and squid ink pasta were delicious ! yet everything else we ' ve tried wasn ' t bad at all . the ingredients are all fresh and the flavors are very sensitive and cheerful . we ' ll be going back there very soon . 
great foods
we asked at the hotel where to go for brunch and they shuttled us over to the half door . not so sure that was a good choice . it wasn ' t that they were bad , just that " brunch " in hartford isn ' t what it is in the south , you know ? the location is decent - i ' m sure that it is much more interesting later in the evening . in the morning ( ish ) hours , it ' s a bit like the leftovers from the night before , and hanging out in a bar pub tavern for brunch can be a bit depressing . service was actually spot on , and food was good , but it just wasn ' t the best atmosphere for us at the time . that said , the atmosphere later in the day is probably a whole lot better - it ' s more of a corner pub , where if you ' re downtown , the public house of vaughan ' s is just a bit different , but in the same vein . 
ok this place is getting N stars because mike the bartender was the best ! fun and engaging . thanks mike ! 
my father was recently here to visit and ventured off to lunch while i was at work . he came back reporting that he ' d eaten the most amazing sandwich of all time at paesanos . . . . and my father is a vegetarian , leaving his options a little more limited at paesanos . i ventured there today and have to say dad was quite right . the paesano was quite possibly the most perfect sandwich i ' ve ever eaten . the horseradish mayo and fried egg elevated this sandwich a notch above all others . my dining companion ordered the zawzeech and remarked that it was also the best sandwich he ' d ever had . ( i ' m noticing a trend here ) . N votes for the most amazing sandwich we ' ve ever eaten , a terrific italian market location , and terrific staff . why would you not go here ? 
great pizza and nice outdoor area with tv ' s
i went here a few months ago and the food was not worth the price . it was a friday night and the place was practically empty . the food was premade since my husband wanted to order a stuffed chicken dish without mushrooms and they couldn ' t accommodate i had the calamari for an appy and noticed a piece of plastic in it . i didn ' t think much of it and took it home and ate it the next day and i discovered more pieces of plastic it was saran wrap and big pieces ! i couldn ' t believe it i got grossed out . and my husbands dinner that night was horrible he didn ' t even finish it . he had chicken breast and i swear it was pre cooked and they stuck it in the microwave to heat it up . it was hard and rubbery . he didn ' t even finish it . overall huge disappointment . i will never go back again . the staff was great . cute place they just need to get a chef in the kitchen . 
i ' ve eaten there twice , both times with groups of N or more people . everybody said that they had great food . the staff was really nice and we had no complaints . nice , romantic atmosphere and the location is only a minute off of the west shore expressway . prices were average for a nice restaurant on staten island . i would recommend getting a reservation for a saturday night , because they were really busy both times we went . 
i ' ve dined here multiple times , and i had an amazing experience every time . first , the ambiance- intimate size , beautiful rustic colors , fresh flowers on each table , and clean . second , the food- simply put amazing ! - i ' ve tried so many items and there hasn ' t been one that i didn ' t completely devour . arroz con pollo ( chicken and rice dish ) huge portion , tender chicken , super tasty . pechuga de pollo a la plancha- my favorite- juicy , flavorful chicken , not greasy at all love love all the little sauces that come with it ! parihuela- awesome seafood stew - portion enough to share among N ! full of fresh shrimp , fish mussels . i can go on and on ! third , the staff- very nice and accommodating . great service and food brought out hot and fresh . i ordered takeout once for my husband and placed the order halfway through my meal , and it came out ( hot ) right on time at the end of my meal . another plus point if this place is how affordable it is and it ' s byob ! this is the place for great peruvian cuisine without breaking the bank ! definitely a " must try " 
my friend and i went there on sat . night , it was not allowed to make reservation if your party is less than N . we ordered mushroom for appetizer which is good , the spaghetti limon is not that special for us , but the special risotto for saturday is very good . 
this place is a complete dive . totally outdated , in the middle of nowhere , ugly and dark interior , etc . but it ' s home to the best hot dog i ' ve ever had . yes , i ' m serious . go and enjoy . and oh yeah , make sure you bring cash ! 
salmon pan seared . perfectly cooked . crispy crust and not dry at all . not fatty too . tried the bolognese too . veal and ricotta . great dish . 
first time i went in a had the house special , very good . last trip i had the beef stroganoff it tasted like a tv dinner . not very good
we have a second home in chester and whenever we are there we go here a couple times . the food is awesome ! they have a great selection of draft beers , the wait staff is friendly and the service is great . it ' s a charming old building and the atmosphere is relaxing . they recently celebrated their Nth year anniversary which for chester is a feat on it ' s own ! i hope they stay along time . 
i have to agree with some of the less than N star reviewers . this place is a bit overhyped and was just " ok " . looking at the wait outside of people in the cold , i figured i would just do a to go order . i ordered inside , paid , and was told to wait outside . well , N-N minutes later , i see a whole bunch of delivery orders going out and no one there calling out for mine . well , i go in there , and my order is sitting on a shelf . i wondered how long it was sitting there . it was still warm , so i lucked out there . i just think that perhaps the staff was over-burdened and didn ' t have time to come out to give me . like others said , this place is tiny . a party of two next to me had been waiting out in the cold for N minutes in N degree weather . it would have been good if they had at least some coffee or something outside to keep the people warm . it was a friday night , so perhaps that was why the wait was so long . last , the food . it was good , but not rock my world good , just standard . i have had empanadas in argentina and the ones at empanada mama were filled with more stuff , but were much oilier . the dipping sauce ( green one ) is really good , but if you eat the empanadas with it , it overpowers the flavor . i ordered the rigetone ( sp ? ) , brasil , and cuban . liked the cuban the best of all of them . in summary , the food is good , but not good enough to wait for more than N minutes . there are so many restaurants in the area that i would go elsewhere if there are more than N-N parties on the list ahead of you . the interior was dark , crowded and noisy . i would give this place another try , but not if there was a substantial wait . 
delicious food ! i had a very large order of breakfast sandwiches and they all came out perfectly with everything that was requested on each ! i was impressed . . the only downfall is they don ' t accept credit debit cards . . when i ' m in the boonton area again i will absolutely go back . 
love the tacos here . meat is soooooo good . the wait is about an hour after you place your order if you go to the restaurant . and at the food truck its about one hour and N mins to get your food . you can tell they are good just by the way time . wont be disappointed . 
awesome food ! different than many falafel joints . much more refined cooking and extensive menu . incredibly good ! awesome music sometimes too ! kath bloom ? 
condering that this place was transformed from a big ed ' s ribs restaurant , which sat there empty for years . i ' d say they deserve a round of applause . the building was in very bad shape . in time it will have it ' s own personality . you know the saying " rome wasn ' t built in a day . " getting a restaurant off the ground takes time . we ' ve dined there quite a bit and have had some wonderful meals . like any other diner , their ' s always room for improvement . the place has only been open for a very short time . it hasn ' t had much exposure yet . i must say that their tuna is terrific as well as their burgers . we ' ve had breakfast , lunch and dinner there . the staff is very friendly . when a restaurant first opens it ' s a very awkward time . getting familar with the community takes time as well . if your not happy with something let them know so they can improve it . they ' ll do well if given the chance . again , remember what was there before . they deserve a pat on the back for bringing a diner to south brunswick which really doesn ' t have many eateries of this type . spread the word and help them grow . 
reminds me one of our places in prague , loud , funny spot with quite good food . . very cool to hang out but beware , always crowded ) 
stop . go somewhere else . . this was a place i would stop in N times a week on way home from work as a last resort , . this was the last . i ordered a grilled chicken sandwich to go . i got home ready to eat my N sandwich and that was it just a piece of dry chiken on a stale roll nothing else no not a thing but dry chicken and stale bread . now i ' m not one to complain at all but i figured i ' ll call since they know me by face and i alway order the same thing maybe it was a mistake just let them know . well after i tell her she said thats what you ordered and i should of oredered a " lady godiva " then put me on hold . . of course now i wait just to hear again the dry chicken was my fault . when she comes back on saying " yea what do you want " i just told her i expected at least a tomato maybe lettuce , again she repeated " well thats a godiva you should of ordered that " then hung up . . okay so i ask how does any place even serve that nevermind charging a ridiculous price for it . my advice to anyone that thinks of going there . don ' t . there are N other diners within Nmiles go its worth the drive . this place is run down and so is the staff . 
awesome neighborhood spot for a quick bite to eat . went in on a monday night and sat at the bar . atmosphere and service were both exceptional , and the food was even better . i got the rigatoni with beef meatballs , which were some of the best i ' ve ever had . and best of all , it was only N . this will definitely be one of my go-to places for a quick meal or better yet , some awesome drunk food ( they ' re open til Nam ) . 
i really love the food here . the pasta is delicious and the salads are so tasty . the service is also impeccable . the waiters are very timely and attentive . i highly recommend the black label burger , it is a staple at this place . 
meh . caf lulac was full so we wandered over to hunter , where there was plenty of room . not surprising after all . food is ok but N out of N in our party felt the portions were a bit skimpy . 
i don ' t know why i decided to give continental another try . the overpriced asian fusion stuff just gets old . not to mention their service is horrible . just left from lunch there . correction-- i had to get my entire order packed to go because somehow the waitress lost the order for a good N minutes ! i can understand if it was a rush but there were less than N patrons in the whole place . then she decided to bring the check before we even got the food . and for N . N the asian po ' boy is about the size of an appetizer , and comes with no sides , which is ironic considering the origin of the name . . . never again ! 
i ' ve tried to give them a fair chance . everything always sounds appetizing , but the taste somehow falls short . experience N had the lamzou favorite . was ok , but lacked any punch . experience N had a mozzarella , pesto and tomato sandwich . bland . no basil garlic flavor . needed salt . experience N asked for a small cappucino . instead got large brown mess of scalding milk , no foam , with slight flavor of burnt milk . definitely not a cappucino . oh and got charged for a large . don ' t waste your time . there are better places . 
a few friends of mine think the world of this lil restaurant . . it holds a special place in their relationship and apparently the food is phenom ! so naturally , i had to find out for myself whether or not this is the bees knees . plopped myself down in the back with some friends and started ordering off drinks . . . and i was instantly in heaven . their beer N shot combo made for a very interesting start to our meal . after two-three rounds of that combination i was feeling loose and ready to tackle some arepas and empanadas . first up were the yo-yos . . they were sweet and scrumptious . . nicely prepared and cheap . . the sauce that came with it was also syrupy goodness . . . being that i am more of the savory fellow . . . i only had one . . but it was still delish ! next came my arepa ! ! i got the chorizo one with jalapenos . . . fantastic is the best adjective to describe this lil treat . . . my only issue was that the bun it was in was a bit too hard for my liking . . i would ' ve preferred a softer bun similar to a bao . . . regardless . . the chorizo was sublime ! what came next filled my stomach with so much joy that i wanted to lay back in bed and pass out immediately after finishing . it was the braised beef empanada . . . one part sweet . . one part savory . . . all sexy delicious ! i had a love affair with that dish and was disappointed when i realized it was all over ! i will most definitely find my way back to caracas for more of their delicious treats
the food was great , but the service was so incredibly slow ! ! we were there N . N hours and there were only N of us ! ! it was on a thursday night . i will only go back there if i actually want to spend N . N hours there . also , fyi it is byob ( as are so many other places in montclair ) . 
i waited for about an hour to get in and ordered classic ramen the second modern ? ramen with pork buns . ramen was good but not worth for the money N ! and time that i waited for . . i prefer totto ramen , , 
this place was awesome ! i saw the good reviews on yelp and many of them were definitely on point . i went for lunch yesterday with my grandma and she ordered the smoked salmon crepe . our server was really good about making substitutions ( which can be tricky at some establishments , not this one ) . my grandma dislikes goat cheese so a substitution was made for cheddar . i went with the create your own option which came with steak and shrimp ( yes i ' m living lunch life on the edge folks lol ) with portobello mushrooms , feta and spinach . one word delicious ! the steak was unbelievably tender , the mushrooms were just the right size and the shrimp don ' t let me get started on that , very flavorful . for N bucks and to be in montclair i was expecting a small ( hungry in an hour ) portion but that was simply not the case . i had enough left over to take home for another day . also , i ordered a strawberry colada smoothie with a shot of protein which wasn ' t half bad either and i had the butternut squash soup as my opener . heads up the small soup is the price of a small but actually the size of a large so there was no way i was finishing it . the server brought a lid and i took that home with me as well in my doggie bag . the soup was creamy and delicious . the only con which is basically in line with other reviewers is that the food is served on paper plastic plates but to be honest i ' m not going to be a weirdo by taking a star away for that . this is a casual style caf soooooooo if you are looking for a place that serves food on fine china then you probably should go to a place where they charge N-N bucks a plate . i would much rather have amazing food on a plastic plate then N ounces of crappy food made to look like pretentious artwork on a well designed china plate . i ' m definitely going here again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) 
came here with some friends last night for some beers and a bite . we used to come here all of the time when it was the witch , but as the industry , i ' ve only eaten here once , and it was opening week . . . and it wasn ' t awesome , so i decided to give it another go . we do , however , come by somewhat frequently for a glorious beverag , e called ' mummers punch ' . it ' s basically a hangover in a punch bowl , but its oh-so-fun to drink . for N , you get a punch bowl with a little umbrella ladle that contains enough boozy goodness to serve a few rounds amongst a table of N . well worth it . so much fun ! ok fasforward to last night- came in at the end of quizzo , and got seated right away at a nice lil table in the corner . service thru and thru was top notch ! they were on their a-game , yet struck that balance of keeping the beers coming , but not rushing you , or being too attentive to the point of annoying . N stars there . we started with the arancini which came out pretty quick . the balls themselves were a bit on the small side but there were N of them . . . so that works for me ! they were totally delicious . the sauce that you dip them into , however , i didn ' t particularly care for . it looked like marinara , but it had this smoky peppery taste to it . nobody else seemed to mind it . . . but not for me . for dinner , my boyfriend and my friend both got the burgers . as a vegetarian , my options here were limited . there were no sandwiches i could eat , and the entree seemed a bit more serious that i was feeling at the time . i had ordered a salad my first time in , and recall being disappointed with the size excitement level of it , so i went for something that was called " veggie tofu dips " . i expected some sort of fried tofu , crudite and chips that you dip into a side of dip . the waitress warned me that this would be small , but that was ok . i wasn ' t that hungry . what came out was a plate of potato chips and a little jam jar of dip that must have had silken tofu whirled into the dip . not what i was expecting . it wasn ' t awesome , nor was it awful . i certainly wouldn ' t recommend this to anyone , nor would i order it again for myself . the taste wasn ' t that awesome that i ' d encourage anyone to split it either to be honest . it sure was a led balloon . after eating a bunch of chips and french onion dip ( should have run to wawa instead ? ) i felt like a grease trap . we finished our beers , went home , and i went to bed . i woke up around N Na still feeling a bit icky . it ' s my fault for eating the whole thing . those who ate the burgers seemed to make out tremendously better . i ' d give this place N . N stars if i could , but with the choice of N or N . . . and judging from my personal experience , i think N are warranted . it was an a-ok experience , but nothing that i ' ll be running back for . 
no . just plain no . if you ' re going to come here for dumplings be prepared for them to only specialize in pork . which would then lead you to sit down and order something else ( considering you already waited for about N minutes outside to get seated ) . their regular food is a little below mediocre considering they have such high ratings on yelp . the service was disgusting . i understand that there are tons of people in need of service but slow down and wait to hear my order before assuming what i want . thanks . not pleased at all and will probably never come back . 
i will never ever go to this place again . i went to posto last night with a few girlfriends , and i cannot begin to tell you how nasty unwelcoming the staff was . we were seated in the corner , and were given menus . we gave the waitress our drink order , and like girlfriends that haven ' t seen each-other in a while , we got a bit carried away and didn ' t get to look the menu yet . the waitress was quick to roll her eyes , and ask if we were ready to place our orders . we gave her our order , and carried on . she brought our pizza out , which was burned , but still ate it not to hassle . we continued with our drinks , and ignored our server because we refused to let her ruin our meal and time . finally , we ordered deserts , and our bill came without us asking for it , which i think is very rude considering the fact that we were still eating . we set it aside and were finishing our food when the server came back three times to see if we were ' set ' . we settled our bill , and upon leaving , there was a man behind the bar who rudely said , " hope you enjoyed your time " as we walked out . i would imagine that an establishment would be a bit more appreciative considering the fact that i spent over N on burned pizza and a few drinks . as an organizational psychologist , and a long time resident of the area , i was beyond appalled , and disgusted by the staff . they def . all need a lesson in hospitality N . i will not be returning , and will def . make it a point to tell everyone i know not to either . 
see mercy a . ' s below , i couldn ' t have described it any better . service was top notch and the manager truly makes you feel like you are appreciated . the restaurant the perfect size for the servers to provide quality service . it ' s located in the east village but you wouldn ' t be out of place if you are dressed night out of dancing after . they still offered a restaurant week menu last night , although we didn ' t partake , the selections were pretty enticing . south american themed menu , we had the lime o , chicharron de calamar , tacos de pescado , costill , platanos , and pastel de chocolate . loved the hint of truffle oil in the dipping sauce that came with the platanos . the cocktail list looked great too , but we brought our own bottle of red wine . i already know what i ' d like to try the next time i return , caipirinha and palmitos fries , anyone ? 
i love the chicken ! the girl server is ignorant . we can eat a whole chicken ! parking is bad during the weekends . go on weekdays . cash only ! 
we can always count on a quick , reasonably priced dinner at sahara grill near avenue of the arts . we love the hummus and shish kebab , but i don ' t understand why they bother to serve an american style salad with romaine , and rice with every platter , neither of which seems very authentic . but it feels like a family restaurant , the wait staff is so nice , and the food is fresh . 
it ' s hard to get a reservation - but worth it . the tasting menu is thoughtful . the cocktail menu varied and enjoyable , which when added to the excellent service and west village something-something atmosphere means we were blown away ! so happy - ) 
this is the real grimaldi ' s place . mrs . g you are lovely . the Npizza was great . the place and all staff are also great people . tuesday , june N was delightful experience . thank you lisa marie for your service , the dessert to go the band aid ! 
who doesn ' t love fries ? they definitely have the best ones in town here with the largest variety of dipping sauces . classic nyc joint . must come here if you are in nyc and check out the super on-trend st . marks area while you ' re at it ! 
the food is delicious as i heard and the menu is very unique . everything is made fresh with quality ingredients . its perfect place for breakfast or lunch for great price . i had to try memo burger , its amazing ! ! ! ! its perfect amount of house ground beef patty w caramelized onion , fontina cheese on brioche roll . . . and the fresh cut fries are very delicious as well . . the coffee is excellent and they make it the way you like . . it look like they fresh ground beans too . . the service is great with very friendly staffs , the space is small but its very cozy and cute . i will definitely be back to try everything on the menu ! ! i love the place and the food . 
ok , i happened to be walking by and it was late on a rainy day and there was no line . i took it as a sign from god to get some of this . even though i had just had a huge taco . there was no stopping me . boy was it good . i get it . i rarely get the hype , but i get it . yum . yum . yum . i was happy my friend was too full ( idiot ) to eat his because it reheated just as good and was amazing the next day . now only knowing there is always a line will deter me from having it for every single meal . 
delicious tapas in an intimate setting . perfect for a sunny afternoon paired with some sangria . tia pol really understands tapas and doesn ' t just serve mini-portions of traditional american bar appetizers . my favorites include garbanzos fritos , patatas bravas , and tortilla espanola . a bit on the pricey side , but great for a special treat . 
get extra cheese on the pizza , otherwise its delicious . 
i tried the harissa falafel sandwich from taim . each falafel ball is extremely moist , well seasoned , and has that much needed crunch . the israeli salad within is really good compared to other places where they throw in a few limp pieces of lettuce and tomato . at N . N , this sandwich may be a little pricey . fortunately , the quality makes up for it . do get the ginger mint lemonade . at N , it makes for a refreshing thirst quencher . 
so glad we had time to stop here ! everything was amazing and fresh ! 
my honest option is the food is good , but the service is a bit lacking . short on genuine customer interest , but on the upside it ' s a good eat . 
wow . we have been coming here for years , and under the new ownership , it was terrible . the food is bland and all tastes the same , and it seems the prices have gone up ! what a disappointment . the crispy tangy beef was not crispy or tangly , the chicken was rubber and unflavored , just bad all around . we will be looking for a new place- shame to say good bye after N years , but i guess you ' ve gotta move on eventually . i do not recommend . 
oh yea place is great
line is worth it ! best bacon in nyc . biscuits are amazing as is their raspberry jam . 
convenient place for my fellow commuters to get breakfast in the morning before hopping on the train into new york city ! food is great quality , service was friendly and efficient . i definitely will be back for brunch on the weekends . . . . as a proud foodie i highly recommend everyone try this new restaurant ! 
this is one of my favorite restaurants . i ' ve tried a number of dishes and they have all been wonderful . danny meyer ' s restaurants all emphasize great service and i have always been treated very well here . the mixed berry ricotta pancakes are perfectly made and flavorful . the berries and ricotta come on the side so you can add to your taste . the pastas and meat dishes are delicious and fresh . you won ' t leave feeling heavy at all ! great flavors all around . definitely make reservations in advance . maialino books up fast ! 
awesome brunch spot - awesome brunch drinks . i went with a large group ( N people ) and the staff were able to easily accommodate us ( with a reservation ahead of time ) . the menu doesn ' t mention that you actually get fried potatoes and leeks , with every egg dish . not knowing this we ordered several sides of the potatoes with cheddar , however no one ended up eating them because they were actually already included . the sweet ricotta doughnuts with dipping sauces are incredible . worth sharing . a tad pricey but worth it for the quality and portions of food that you get . 
oh goodness . yes ! can i have some more ? ? ? ? ? i give it five stars . well , i ' ve tried a few indian food places and those other places could never get the flavor of chicken tikka masala right . when i lived in nj , i was always craving chicken tikka masala from naan n ' curry , . one swipe of the chicken tikka masala with my alu paratha and my eyes rolled in the back of my head in happiness . oh goodness . really really really good . i only interacted with the man behind the counter , which i assume . . . . is the owner ? well , he was just really nice ) . he asked if the chicken tikka masala was too spicy for me . garlic naan- yumm chicken tikka masala-yumm good sauce chicken jefferazi--yumm , good spices chicken birayni--good spices chicken tikka---very juicy chicken sheek kebab-- good raita- good . . nice tangyiness those were the items we tried today . . . . . i was very please by this place . . i would def recommend this place to anyone . i live N mins away and this is a perfect spot to take food togo . . . . service was awesome . . the waiter always kept coming with water and items we needed . . . 
pretty awesome , love the service ambiance . the outdoor dining is also a nice treat . i love the fish chips mmm . . . sea bass . . . love love love ! 
delicious joint . fall the green tea macaroon and green tea tiramisu left and right . if you ' re a matcha fan , you don ' t want to miss this place . 
the tall , blonde waitress with long hair who was in her N ' s was blatantly rude , sarcastic , and disrespectful . my friend , who is in a wheelchair , was trying to get to our table and as we are trying to squeeze through the tables ( which are clearly not designed with wheelchair users in mind ) the waitress impatiently told us that we can ' t block the way . she kept hounding us to order food when i gave her a specific time when our last guest was arriving , which we promptly honored ( not to mention we were ordering drinks anyway not like we were just having water ) . then , there was confusion about the bill and she accused us of shorting her . finally , when i asked for a manager she refused to get one and accused me if being crazy . me and my friends were highly upset and seriously consider returning after such terrible behavior from the wait staff at kona . 
the best brunch i ' ve ever had , hands down . and byob ? amazing ! just make sure you plan ahead as most liquor stores aren ' t open on sunday mornings . and get there early . 
this place takes you straight into an european old world elite parlor . it ' s just regal and festive with the exclusive secrecy of the speak easy that it portrays ! they serve up delicious specialty cocktails N different menus for each specific time of their operating hours . . . . . so chic ! ! my favorite part is that they have oysters prosecco and they offer a late night menu with the guilty little pleasures you could ask or crave for a typical trendy new york city night out ! i say , show up for a few cocktails and a some yummy bites . . . . . you will absolutely enjoy every moment ! ! 
this seems to be a reoccurring theme with most small italian restaurants downtown - good appetizers but horrible entrees . my advice is to stick to their small bites menu and avoid the larger dishes . you ' ll thank me for it . the wait staff is always very friendly and helpful . try their ribs special - it ' s pretty good ! 
town tavern is excellent ! unbelievable food with a great staff an awesome dining experience ! 
french food i have ever had ! it ' s the best ! i loved the clam and oyster ! the bread was so good i needed some more ! fazio ur da bomb ! i also had muscles for the first time and they were delicious ! i will always remember that day . 
as a frequent sushi eater , i wanted to try out a new place for my birthday . i heard , and read mixed reviews about sushi house , in which the crowd was a bit iffy , and so was the service , but i still decided to make a reservation for a party of N for a saturday night to try it out . that was a mistake ! upon our arrival , i was told that my party would not be able to be seated until everyone was present . understandable . however , the place was dead , so having to wait N minutes to be seated while we waited for four people was a bit ridiculous . but we were okay with that , we decided to grab a few drinks at the bar so the wait would be bearable . the service at the bar was pretty slow , and the bartender did not have the most of pleasant attitudes , but we managed . we were then seated by a polite host , and shortly after we were greeted by a rude , snobby waitress . i asked her if the restaurant allowed for separate checks , since we were a pretty big group , and she said yes . throughout dinner , we barely saw our waitress , and when we did see her was because one of us had to flag her down in order to get refills , or whatever the case was . her nasty attitude was not appreciated whatsoever , and we felt as if we were an inconvenience to her on a slow night . at one point , we wanted to order drinks , but we did not know the whereabouts of our unpleasant waitress , so we decided to take a quick trip to the bar . while at the bar , we tried to get the bartender ' s attention , and were completely ignored . we stuck around for about N minutes , and decided to not wait any longer , and returned to our table , where we contemplated in asking for our bill in order to go out else where for drinks , in the hopes of actual pleasant service , and where our money would be much more well appreciated . when the group was done with dinner , my boyfriend then asked our waitress for some sort of desert , since we were celebrating my birthday . she then snarls at him and said " cake ? ! well , no one told me anything ! we don ' t have it " and walked away . a few minutes later , she returned and said to him , " did you bring cake ? i don ' t know what you were talking about . " he then told her " well , if you stuck around for N more seconds i could have told you that i did not bring anything and i was asking about any type of desert , and not a cake . " she then brings out a slice of weird-tasting cheesecake with a lit candle . as everyone was fed up with the crappy service , and no longer wanted to stick around , i asked for our bills , and she said that she would have to ask her manager to do that . we waited nearly half an hour , and had to ask her at least three more times . granted , we were a big party , but rude service is unacceptable , whether it ' s a party of two , or twenty . it ' s not good for your business ! the food was bland , and for the price of items on the menu , we expected better quality , as well as fresh sushi food . i do not recommend sushi lounge in totowa to any one . spend your money else where , where you will probably find better quality service , and better quality of food for the money you will be spending . the only good thing this place has going is the decor . 
every time i order here for delivery food is still hot . everything on their menu is delicious . definitely recommend this place . 
the brunch i had here was a religious experience . . . both times . and yeah though i walked through the shadows of parc i did not foot the bill . . . so that probably has something to do with why i loved it so much . . . but the food was divine . the ambiance cannot be beat . the service was impeccible . we lingered and lingered over more than one bottle ( both times ) and didn ' t feel rushed in the least . they ' ve done a great job with the place- it feels like it ' s been there forever . 
no doubt the trenton pork roll festival could have been something special given the concept and all the vendors and bands that showed up . however , the word is that N , N people invited themselves for a N person party , and the logistics were just not capable of handling the scene . too , a massive thunderstorm in mid afternoon blew out the electricity , shutting down the bands , and dousing everyone and their pork roll sandwiches . the canopies were not able to control the deluge . i was there for a few minutes in early evening after the last of the heavy downpour , but not post the straggling showers that seemed to hang over trenton social all day . after standing in line and getting soaked , i decided discretion was the better part of valor , and beat a retreat to find a dry place for dinner . please try again next year , fellas . you are on to something here . 
this pizza has tasteless sauce , we couldn ' t put enough chili pepper and salt to make it taste good , and still it didn ' t . sorry west coast beats east coast . 
love , love , love this place ! ! never ( and i mean never ) had a bad meal here ! ! i get various dishes but husband always gets some form of duck and it is delicious ! ! ! ! last time ( on a week day ) we were there they were so busy you can ' t believe it ! we had to wait like an hour for our food but truth be told we didn ' t mind . . it really is that good ! ! i have turned quite a few people on to mie thai and they all come back thanking me ! ! do yourself a favor and give it a try ! ! 
best latin restaurant in the nutmeg state ! ! ! 
me and my friend ate there last night and the service was amazing and the food was okay . i ordered a salmon plate and my friend ordered one of the bucket of crabs . there wasn ' t a lot of meat at all inside those legs and for that price . then we asked if they had military discount , said yes and got the manager . she snatched our i . ds and staring at it for awhile then asked what branch it was . all the while she was being extremely rude and snarky . then she said we don ' t do dependents only active , and we exclaimed saying sorry that our husbands are over seas fighting for your country . her name was kelly and that was beyond disrespectful . would never go back just due to her . 
good god i love this place . jenga ? free cheese puffs ? frito pie ? hot dogs ? beam creams ? sold . and people can buy you drinks while you aren ' t around , and then you come in and see your name up on a board and soon enough you have a free drink in your hand ! it ' s magical . there ' s also a jukebox , pool ( which is fun even though i am horrible ) , darts , scrabble and connect four ! plus , i just found out i can bring my dog . this place could not get better if it tried . 
whoever is making the burritos lately better wake up ! all the ingredients were lined up next to each other then rolled . so you ate a bunch of beans followed by guacamole then a line of cheese with rice at the other end . ridiculous . can ' t be that hard to mix it up before you roll it . . . 
had my aunts wedding shower here , october N . food was excellent . beautiful fall day , view of golf course was a plus ! cart shuttles from the parking lot to the restaurant came in handy for the older guests that have difficulty walking . will be having future party ' s here ! thanks for everything ! 
the pancakes here are pretty damn good , but i ' m not so sure these pancakes are worth the the long wait , good . i had to order the blueberry pancakes , since everyone had nothing but marvelous things to say about them . and yes i would have to agree-they ' re a must , if you do choose to endure the absurd wait . maybe if there staff were a little more attentive to the guests , the line wouldn ' t be out the door . if i return i will have to head the advice of others and either come first thing in the morning or try them out on a weekday . 
was leaving nyc and wanted to try the Nst pizza place . my experience fast to come out . . . cheese was freshly made but not very flavorful or enough on the pizza sauce was san marzano but had better flavor elsewhere crust was nyc thin style nothing special for the price i would get di fara pizza and would never look anywhere else
wonderful food and service ! friendly atmosphere ! 
absolutely the best pizza and beer in town . high quality , very tasty house brewed beers on tap with a plethora of other worldly brews to choose from . the pizza specials are always offering an incredible variety of local products , as well as a few standby traditional types . service is fast and friendly . quite affordable too . a great place for both family and friend outings . 
had a nice meal at hillstone while in nyc to meet up with a friend . the red bean soup was fantastic and the prime rib was good also but nothing spectacular . my wife had the filet and it was really good , if i were to go back i would probably opt for that . prices are what one would expect for nyc . the only aspect i didn ' t care for was how loud they had the music in the back dining area . they had a great little three piece ensemble playing jazz and it was piped through the place and it was too loud for the atmosphere while dining . a little turn of the volume dial would have helped . we asked but were told that ' s just the way it is . 
overpriced food and horrible service . apparently i have to give it at least one star to post but this place doesn ' t deserve that ! been here twice . the first time my girlfriend and i went in around noon or Npm on a sunday . i wanted breakfast and the menu we were given was the lunch dinner menu and had only a few breakfast items in it . when i asked for a breakfast menu the waitress said " we don " t have a breakfast menu , what do you want ? " i responded that i ' d like to see what they normally have during breakfast hours as the menu we were given only had a handful of items . she looked confused and irritated and said " that ' s what we have " referring to the menu we had in front of us . i ended up going with lunch instead , which was very good . once our food was brought to the table , we never saw the waitress again until we had finished and waited so long for drink refills that we didn ' t want them anymore . decided one night to go back here again and give it another shot . we had dinner with family so we stopped for coffee and dessert . after being seated we realized there was no desserts listed on the menu . we asked the waiter for the dessert menu to which he responded " we don ' t have a dessert menu , i ' ll just tell you what we have " and proceeds to quickly rattle off a list we could only understand about half of because of the speed of his reciting the list and his heavy accent . when he finished he just stood there and stared at us . i said " i know we want coffee and water for right now . " he went away to get it and i asked my girlfriend if she caught any of that list and understood what he said . she said " i caught chocolate cake , so i guess i ' ll get that . " i said " one of those items was wedding something did you understand what he said ? " she said she didn ' t understand either . when he came back he asked what we wanted and i explained that i still don ' t know what they have to choose from . he just stood there and stared at us . my girlfriend spoke up and said she ' d like chocolate cake and i said i ' ll just have coffee . other than bringing the cake for my girlfriend the waiter never came back until she had finished her cake and our coffee was long gone . when he did come back all he said was " you want anything else ? " i felt like saying " yeah a refill on my coffee , a dessert menu so i could have gotten what i specifically came here for , and a waiter that gives a crap " but i kept my cool and didn ' t . he dropped the check on the table and walked away without saying another word . high prices and poor service makes this a place we won ' t return to . 
one of the best brunch places in the city . we go as a staff from work a few times a year , and have never been disappointed . their standard menu includes well priced and good brunch dishes , such as the breakfast burrito and the bacon and spinach frittata . spend a few extra bucks for the huevos rancheros , it ' s one of the dishes that brings us back . the coffee alone is worth the trip . one of our co-workers came just for that . they always have a list of specials going , also unique brunch dishes , typically with a theme . we went a few days ago , and everything was named after whitney houston songs . we ' ve never gone on a weekend , and i ' ve heard if you do , expect at least a N-N minute wait . the place is a little small , but located in the italian market , so good places to hang around if you do have to wait . we always go on weekdays around N-Nish , and the place is typically full to near full . if that doesn ' t say how good the place is , i don ' t know what does . if you haven ' t been , check it out , guaranteed you won ' t be disappointed . 
good burgers ! but i like mine with a lot of stuff so these are a little too plain
i went to this restaurant on a monday and the wait was not bad at all , about twenty minutes for a table for five . i heard the wait could be hours . when you walk in , there is an enclosed patio to the right and the main restaurant to the left . we ordered several dishes featured on their website and the food came out very fast . service was great . i am sad to say i found the food mediocre . we ordered the greek salad , calamari , and fried cheese which were exceptional . but then for main course we had the seafood platter which was very disappointing . seafood was overcooked - lobster tail and shrimp were chewy . we also ordered the greek sausage that were so burnt it really took away from tasting the sausage . with all that said , the meal ended with complimentary vanilla pudding dessert . the price was also very reasonable . enjoy ! 
best . pizza . in . greenpoint . possibly brooklyn . must get the greenpointer . lemony arugula and shaved parmesan on top of their amazing crust - so dreamy . option to add prosciutto , but not necessary . amazing on its own . hellboy - hell yes . in ricotta da vita - mama mia ! there will probably be a wait when you go , but get over it . go down the street to brouwerij lane , enjoy a pint or half pint , and then head on back . no big deal . we always bring out of town guests here and it never fails to be a big hit . love it when paulie ( aka martin scorsese ' s doppleganger ) comes to the table at the end of the meal with his black shirt , baseball cap , and to-go coffee cup and asks how the meal was , what we got , where we ' re from . this is greenpoint to a t quality , friendly , community-centric , personable . quite frankly the neighborhood just wouldn ' t be the same without paulie gee ' s . 
i ordered the chicken kebab plate with salad and whole wheat pita . first , the food was delivered over an hour later . when trying to call the restaurant , noone answered . second , the delivery man didn ' t follow the explicit directions i gave online -- to not ring the doorbell but to call my cell . third , the salad was super soggy and they gave me plain white pita instead of the whole wheat i ordered . the food wasn ' t bad , but it wasn ' t great . just not sure if i ' ll be ordering from here in the near future . 
great fresh bagels , delicious and inventive cream cheese . donates to local organizations . 
i had brunch here with some friends as the start of a bachelor ' s day party . could not have started the day better , fantastic food , friendly service and a great atmosphere . i hope i can get back into philly to eat here again soon . 
hands down the best meal my boyfriend and i have ever had . we went for our anniversary and it was absolutely perfect . we were nervous we wouldn ' t get a table because it was a saturday night during a holiday weekend and we called for a reservation midday . they told us they didn ' t have a table until Np but we could stop by to see if there was a bar table . we did that and i think it worked out even better . our wait for a table was only about Nmin it went so quickly because we were having a great time at the bar . great wine selection . the calamari , scallop , vermicelli in cream sauce awesomeness was my favorite . i would have licked the bowl . we also tried the spicy potatoes , ham croquettes , spinach artichoke empanada , short rib flatbread , and wagyu beef brochettes . can ' t wait to go back ! 
the good the food here was delicious , and the portions were generous . they also have a great gluten-free selection , which is rare for an italian place . i ' m not personally gluten free but a lot of my friends are . their chocolate cake for dessert was also delicious , and my table received a complimentary piece to share because we had to wait a very long time for a table . the place is also a byo , is relatively cheap , and yet still has a much classier atmosphere than the typical byos crowded with rowdy college students . the bad the layout of this restaurant needs serious help . it ' s impossible to stand and wait for a table without getting in the way of diners , waiters , and other customers trying to get in the door . the process of asking for a table and waiting was stressful and uncomfortable . we were a party of N on a monday night , and didn ' t have reservations , so i really recommend reserving a table for this restaurant no matter the day of the week or the size of your party . however , it does seem like they were slammed more than normal on this particular night . they were also extremely understaffed . one poor waiter was responsible for playing the role of hostess , call taker , waiter , and busboy , and there was only one of him . there were some other waitstaff but the hostess should ' ve just been responsible for one thing . although service wasn ' t great , i think the staff were frazzled for that unfamiliar monday rush and i do think they are nice staff members overall . the waiter did bring us complimentary dessert which certainly helped their case . overall , this is a great spot to try , but make sure you reserve ahead . 
N . N stars its good i ' m just not in love with it . in terms of value this is a lot better than curry ya , but i prefer curry ya ' s taste over go go . i made the mistake of ordering the grand slam after skimming through yelp reviews and then not actually looking at what it included when i ordered ! the grand slam is epic in size and could probably be shared between N who aren ' t that hungry . 
great brunch location ! ! we started off with a large french press coffee for the table and it was heavenly . it was my first time using a french press and it was a fun experience . while we were waiting for our waiter , the chef came out and asked what we were going to have . i had mentioned i was going to have the scramble which was on the specials and he seemed a little disappointed . when i asked what he suggested and he said , today my favorite is malohwa but that changes every day . i went with his recommendation and it was so delicious ! the pastry melted in your mouth and the tomato salad greek yogurt sides gave the dish a nice balance . others in our group had the egg scramble special , the cyprus breakfast and the eggs in stewed tomatoes . everyone was extremely happy with their choices ! ! ! ! ! if you ' re in the area , check this place out . oh , btw , it ' s byob ! ! ! ! ! 
i love the food and it is always nicely decorated for all the seasons . i have never been dissappointed for anything that i or any of my friends have ordered . it is a favorite spot for me to meet my friends afterwork . jay was the bartender that is so personable and know how to mix a mean mojito . he introduced me to a white mojito that may be my regular drink from now on . 
food was very rustic and yet it was very flavorful . . . appetizers were light and delicious , also fried chicken was the best among the entr es . great for a quick small meals . . 
i had high hopes for this place , but was sadly disappointed . for a " cheesesteak co . " i would expect fast service . it took almost Nminutes for them to make the steak . i asked for a american without and when i said that , the cashier looked at me like i was speaking greek . i should have turned around and left at that moment . the roll was decent , but it seems like they may toast it or something , so it was flaky and kind of hard . the steak was average at best and i tried my best to find a drop of cheese and could not find it . what is even more bizarre is that this is like a restaurant with a server , not like a typical steak shop with tables that you can sit down at without a server . they have some nerve charging the price of one of the big boy steak shops for this peter pan , hillbilly , steak . in the words of the prince , this steak is a mistake . take your N bucks , go elsewhere , get a decent steak and a wiz fry and enjoy yourself . 
excellent meal , service and prices . not really knowing what to expect our first night in ny as we were cold , hungry and tired , we gave it a try and loved it so much we went back the next night ! service is exceptional . 
visiting from texas decided to eat here because of rave reviews from the wife from her college years . needless to say it ' s the best pizza i ' ve ever had . not trying to score points with my wife but really the pizza was glorious ! i would definitely visit this establishment many more times in the future ! 
when my wife and i moved to philadelphia , this is one of the first places we discovered . twice a week or so we would stop in for dinner or a drink , and it wasn ' t long before we were on a first name basis with all the bartenders , the owner , the cooks and the regulars . the kensington port richmond area isn ' t exactly known for being a welcoming place , but the green rock is fantastic . monday nights have a open mic that fills up quickly with a lot of local legends , and of course the weekends are always pretty packed . seating can be an issue friday-monday , but that ' s to be expected . their beers are inexpensive and their food is really quite good . their burgers and pierogi are both great deals . 
my brother evil-taste-twin recommended this place however , i was underwhelmed . for a place that appears to be marketing themselves as a small-plates joint , they better brush up on their small plates . we ordered the charcuterie , olives , and an arugula chicken salad . the salad was fresh , but not tasty . the olives came with an abundance of bread but nothing to surprise the senses in the preparation of the olives . the charcuterie was abundant , but could have been assembled at associated . don ' t give it a french name if it doesn ' t taste like it came from a foreign country . service was very good on the other hand , and i have been told by others in the know that they have some good small plates ( that i didn ' t order ) . 
amazing comfort food with creative complex flavors
ok , i ' m surprised i haven ' t reviewed hillstone yet . this place is fantastic for the following reasons N - it ' s on park avenue , yet the prices don ' t make you feel like you ' re getting ripped off . N - service is always impeccable . the hostesses are friendly . the waiter waitresses are attentive . yet your table has a small army of servers , but they all seem to know what ' s going on . N - the veggie burger . seriously , delicious . i think if you ' re a meat eater or not , you ' ll love it . it ' s one of the best i ' ve ever had . N - this is a great place for so many occassions family parents visiting , catch-up dinner girl and guy friends , a date , work event . N - the decor is old school , in a good way . that is my list and that is all you should need . 
went to almond for brunch yesterday afternoon and it is now one of our top brunch spots . the location and outdoor seating is perfect , and the food was delicious . i had the omelette with chorizo -- definitely a repeat . the service was great . this place is awesome and will be in the brunch rotation . 
i was wavering between one and two stars , but settled on two because the pulled pork wasn ' t bad and i liked the pecan pie . i had dinner with N people . we were seated immediately and the waitress took our drink order right away . we got our drinks and she took our order . then the waiting began . . . . our food arrived about N minutes later . i ordered the three meat platter - pulled pork , brisket and blackened catfish . my sides were fried okra and mashed potatoes . pulled pork was moist and flavorful . my brisket was beyond fatty and basically inedible . the catfish was flavorless . my sides were cold and nothing to write home about . my husband ' s mac-n-cheese ( also cold ) was underwhelming . everything seemed to need salt ( which we had to ask for as there was none on the table ) . the corn bread was funky and not in a good way . after we got our food our waitress all but disappeared . we had to flag someone down to get us water . the space is pretty tight in there and i ended up getting elbowed in the head by one of the waitstaff , who exclaimed " don ' t worry , it was just my elbow " as he rushed past . it was just his elbow as opposed to what ? a greasy , dirty plate ? no idea . in sum , it ' s expensive and the food is mediocre . i was also unimpressed by the portions , not that i was dying to eat more of anything , mind you . we won ' t be back . 
better than most mexican fare in ct and pretty good stuff overall , but having eaten at even cheaper , even better places around the country and in mexico itself , i can ' t help think the place is a bit pricey . i felt like i paid too much for simply a plate of two tacos al pastor with some rice and refritos , and guac on the side . that being said , i do visit often as it ' s not terribly far from me and the food is quite good . i wish they had some quality tortas sandwiches though and avoid the sopes . way overpriced and lousy-- these are the things you buy on the street in mexico for N cents and they ' re much better than at monte alban . everything else i ' ve tried has been good to very good though . 
i should title this review " the front of the ship " , as in " the back of the bus . " i have wanted to go to the moshulu for a long time , because i ' ve heard good things about the food and service and also because i ' m interested in the ship and its history . the food and service were terrific , but there was one major problem . when we were seated , the hostess took us to the back left room in the dining area , which is actually toward the bow of the ship . my companion , who is black and has experienced being put in the corner in many restaurants , thought we were sent to this inconspicuous area because we are an interracial couple . she said , could we sit at another table , next to where we were seated but not in the back room . the hostess explained that they have to seat tables in a way that will balance the number of parties each of the servers is helping . however , within three minutes , the table we had asked for was filled , i believe by two or three white men . i was skeptical about what my companion said , or should i say naive . the waiter asked if we wanted to speak with the manager , but we didn ' t ( we should have ) . when we were seated , another interracial couple was seated in the back room , and within short order two additional black couples were seated there , where there may be eight or ten tables . in fairness , when i went to the men ' s room , i found that there were a couple of black couples seated elsewhere . needless to say , this experience ruined our evening at the moshulu . the restaurant needs to do something about what seems to be a discriminatory policy , whether it is or not . maynard r
brunch at locanda verde ever since it opened its doors on the corner of greenwich n . moore streets , i ' ve been very anxious to dine at lv ( locanda verde ) . set within robert de niro ' s greenwich hotel , lv ' s bustling atmosphere evokes that of an unpretentious apres-ski lodge . brunch at locanda verdesince we had not made a reservation prior , the le ' s and i decided that it would be safest to meet at lv for brunch at N Nam . " we should have no problem getting a table that early , " i confidently-stated in my pre-meal email to megan , " i mean , who gets up before Nam on a sunday , anyways ? " do you want to know " who gets up before Nam on a sunday ? " just about every resident in tribeca , where lv is located ! remember , this is stroller-ville , after all , not the east village . luckily , i arrived on the earlier side of our N Nam meeting time and took the brunt of our quoted " N-minutes to N-hour " wait for a table . when megan and hung finally showed up , we were seated within ten-minutes . i was certain that , having patiently waited for a table for N-minutes , this would be one of the best brunches of all time . the good great interior space and atmosphere , including acoustics friendly and knowledgeable staff affordably priced menu variety view here leelee sobieski ( baby , husband , and mom ) was dining next to us ! gratis bread plate , pre-meal light-as-air , pillowy-soft focaccia slices that effortlessly melt in your mouth sheep ' s milk ricotta drizzled with truffle-honey , coarsely-ground black pepper , and a dusting of herbs - it ' s hard to believe that this is the same cheese that is used to make lasagna , for the texture is as light as whipped-cream and the flavor is as rich as marscapone . served at room-temperature , the ricotta is accompanied by buttery slices of burnt-orange toast . this appetizer is , without a doubt , one of the most delicious " bread and cheese " combinations that i ' ve ever had the pleasure of sampling . definitely something worth adding to your " death row wish list . " scampi grits though i found the portion on the smaller side , i appreciated the concept behind this italian version of " shrimp grits . " traditional southern grits were substituted with creamy polenta - whole shrimp were replaced with a robust , chunky tomato sauce that was laced with bite-sized morsels of shrimp and coarsely-ground sausage . two perfectly-coddled eggs completed the dish . the " not necessarily bad , but definitely annoying " tre-stelle while i loved the combination of fruits in this house-made juice ( pomegranate , blood orange , and valencia orange ) , i found its N price tag incredibly ludicrous . but with that being said , i ' m the fool who consciously ordered and forked over the cash for this beverage ! megan ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and , after i took one taste of the lemon curd , i asked our waitress if it would be possible to send me home with a small helping . " i know it ' s a random request , but i am more than happy to pay for it , " i told her . i realized that she had probably never had anyone inquire about lemon curd for take-away , but i figured that , especially since i was willing to pay for it , my question wouldn ' t have been taken as foreign as it was . " let me go and talk to the head chef , " she said , with her eyebrows cinched . before i could tell her not to get the " head chef ' s " attention , she vanished . moments later , she returned to tell me that " the kitchen staff cannot honor your request , i ' m sorry about that . " while i appreciated her efforts , i found it both extremely odd and passive-aggressive that she insisted upon getting both the " head chef " and " kitchen staff " involved . one thing she did do exceptionally well ? making me feel like a complete a-hole . 
best italian food in nyc in the best neighborhood in nyc . reasonably priced , good service , and a great ambiance . only negative is that they don ' t take reservations and sometimes it requires some patience to get a table . 
margaritas are good . that ' s it . want real mexican go to taco riendo at Nth and thompson . this places blows , it ' s not even good mexican american . the shrimp tacos were white . shrimp is supposed to have a tan or red color to it and you can tell how frozen and old there shrimp was cause it was pure white . they were chewy and flavorless . my boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos which seemed to have flavor but were incredibly dry . 
this location just got taken over by the same owners as the stage house in scotch plains . they know how to take a historic structure and convert the inside to an updated , modern , yet stylistically appropriate environment . like the menu at scotch plains , the food is upscale , gourmet , but not stuffy or overpriced . if you appreciate great food , great wine , beer , cocktails but prefer wearing jeans with your shirt un-tucked , this is the place for you . the location is very unassuming . you wouldn ' t expect to find a place like this in a place like this ( you ' ll know what i mean when you go there ) . live music on friday and saturday nights . i plan to check that out soon . 
service was atrocious
thanks to fellow yelper " rachel w . , " i am writing an update for great jones cafe . i hadn ' t been to great jones in a while , too long in fact , and she messaged me to say that they now accept credit cards , just not amex . i am delighted to confirm that she is N correct . on a recent visit , i happily laid down a visa to pay for another great evening of food and drinks . thanks for catch , rachel . 
we came across this using the app while doing some shopping in the soho area . while the food was very good , the thing that stood out the most to me was the service . my girlfriend happens to hate cilantro , and when she ordered at the counter she made sure her noodle bowl had no cilantro in it . i ordered after her and in addition to my entree got a pork pancake . the pork pancake came out , sliced in half , and the woman said that that one side was with cilantro and the other was without . this was just great insight and inference on her part , the kind of customer-forward mentality that really makes a mark . 
sam is great . interior is downright gross . food is fair . restrooms are right out of crime scene photos . if you have a meal here , be prepared to witness some downright odd activity going on . 
went there with a friend and hubby after seeing it on no reservations . nd being the meat eaters that my friend nd hubby are , figured . . wth . grass fed burgers , must be good . luckily we didnt have to wait since we got there bN N on a sunday nite . place quickly got very crowded . nice crowd , atmosphere . we all ordered the burger . food had real potential , meat was good , but way too salty . the fries were salty as well . my hubby noticed there were no salt shakers anywhere , now we know why . you cant fix something after its been od with salt . being we dont live in the area , its not really worth a trip there either . 
let me start off by saying that my family is a big fan of this place for both hibachi and sushi . we do go there typically once every N-N weeks . but lately , it has become apparent that they may be shutting down soon . the food quality ( although still good ) i believe has gone down a touch . they stopped caring about the exterior of the building . rust , overgrown weeds , almost looks out of business from the outside ( embarrasing when we recommend to our friends and they see the outside . . . just unappatizing ) and when you see how they care for their outside , it would typically make you question the cleanliness in the kitchen . thank goodness they cook in front of you for both sushi and hibachi , otherwise i would never come here . it needs a good cleaning on the inside carpets , decor and exterior . with all that said , the food is still tastey , still big portions and at a decent price . note to owner . please clean up the outside and show a little love . it makes a big impression on first time patrons . and make dinner at hibachi an event again . the chefs aren ' t all that enthused any more . we will be back again and again , as long as they stay in business . i ' m just getting worried based upon them not re-investing in their property . 
the best food in philly ( besides cheese stakes ) . you really need to try the soups they are very large and have lots of flavor . the bbq shrimp is delish and the sticky water smells bad . you usually get a side of rice and they have some good all limeade . it ' s cheap and great for the kids ! ! ! 
i went to this place with a friend of mine from florida . it was pouring rain out , and there was a long wait to get seating . normally , that ' s fine by me , but the guy who seats you was a real jerk . the waitress did make up for that , and since she was the only one there serving on that tuesday N N , i give her cudos . the collard greens were so salty i couldn ' t eat them , but the fried chicken , fish and grits were good . the bartender was also quite snippy , and the choices of beverages were not extensive at all . the place is really small , and when you put your name on a blackboard for seating , it ' s for the bar too - because you may have to eat there . if you arrive when no one is in the front , you have no way of knowing that you ' re supposed to put your name on that board . so others that are aware may get seated before you . i won ' t be going back . there are countless other restaurants in bk alone that would appreciate my patronage more than this . 
just had probably the best ever italian calzone . very nice clean attractive establishment . very friendly attentive servers . 
this is my first yelp review . i ' ve never been inclined to write a review , but after repeatedly great and consistent visits to this restaurant , i just had to write one . i consider it positive karma to write this review and give back to a business that is trying to do something simple but very well . the dishes are smart and wonderfully crafted . i ' ve had the " liver and eggs " , which consisted of foie gras and fluffy scrambled eggs on toast . gourmet , unpretentious comfort food . paradoxical ? yes . delicious . absolutely ! well priced ? for being N minutes out of manhattan and w . generous helpings of foie gras ? i was pleasantly surprised . i took my sister here for her birthday . another friend of mine who i dragged to lic said that the market burger was the most delicious burger he had ever had . even the hash and the asparagus is well prepared . today , i had the soft-boiled egg and frisee salad . not my first time , and definitely not my last ! i ' ve never been here during a peak hour and it was so crowded that i had to sit at the bar ( this is also one restaurant , where i feel completely comfortable eating with friends , and also dining alone , which is a rarity ) . the owner was gracious as always . i left thinking , this is what a restaurant is and should be . as long as you go in with certain expectations , that seating may be hard to get when it ' s busy and the portions aren ' t gargantuan ( which is a virtue not a fault ) , you ' ll find yourself cleaning your plate , satiated and happy ! 
love , love , love , this place . they have the best veggie burger and options to make just about any dish vegan ! the service was great ! would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious food ! 
very good and great service ! 
bar none one of my favorite restaurants in manhattan . the black truffle gnoochi is amazing ! ! ! ! 
i found this place driving by , and decided to go in . the glute free pasta was good with their aurora sauce ( pink sauce ) . the waitress was polite , and attentive . the atmosphere is rustic , and familiar , my kind of place to eat . 
from the outside , this place seemed like a total dive . . . which frankly , is pretty ok with me , depending on my mood . upon entering the establishment , i saw that my initial assumptions weren ' t terribly off base , except that the food everyone was eating looked amazing ! we had just popped in to grab a quick drink , but the looks of the food passing by made it impossible to resist , and we ordered a tray of chips with gauc , and two other dipping things that i ' m not even sure what they were , but all i can say is yum ! ! the prices were extremely reasonable , the service was good , and the atmosphere was laid back and fun . my only complaint about this place is that the bathroom is impossible to find without asking for help . ( for real , its in a practically hidden location . ) can ' t wait to go back and explore more of the menu ! 
staying overnight in newark and had a hankering for protuguese food . read the critiques and decided to try coimbra . i was surprised they had my top shelf bourbon - good way to start off the evening . ordered the pork cubes with shrimp ( picadinho com camarao ) - a large dish of meat , potatoes and a few shrimp . delicious and very filling . out the door under N with drink and tip . i would definitely recommend to others and will repeat when i am back in town . 
we live in albany ny and ate from this place few months back . now we have to drive N hrs just to eat it again . we always get N-N platters to go beside eating there . i wish it could be shipped to albany
burger fi , would never make it if it were in the marines semper fi . the burgers were tasty , the french fries ok , the black white milkshake decent too , but for the price and really subpar ordering experience not worth a second trip , unless the amish are not across the street at the terminal that day , but then again panera is opening on march N , and maggiano ' s is on the other side , so options do exists . line was out the door at Npm today , they needed to open up more registers , and the owner was just in the way of the frontend staff . hey mr . owner if you can ' t help , get out of the way . rating N fork , . N knife , N spoon
place is ok , too much meat and it does not really represent serbian food . there are no serbian deserts and it is all about meat . it does have some good dishes . people working there are not very nice and place is totally overprices for some dishes ( example half roasted pepper N bucks ) . first time we went there we stood for half on hour for someone to give us a seat . next time we came with friends and we had to listen people fighting . they kept doors open and it was freezing . 
start with some empanadas . add some ceviche . move along to , wait , back up . . . start with a mojito . add some empanadas and ceviche , then move along to something heartier . i can vouch for the ropa vieja , the vaca frita , and the bistec . all three are solid , meaty choices that ' ll put hair on your chest . i can ' t pick which one is the best because they ' re all good . though the vaca frita does come with a hearty dose of garlic and onions . a warning for those who need to ensure their breath stays fresh for . . . you know . . . " dessert . " just so you know , the mojitos can be stiff and are deceptively sweet . with enough of them in your system , or maybe your date ' s , " dessert " is probably a guaranteed thing . giggity . 
a good restaurant should have good food and service . the bottom line of good service is honesty , which this place doesn ' t have . ( both the owner and server ) i went to this place very often because the food here is affordable and pasta is fresh - usually with my husband . one day , my father came to visit me from korea . i took him to this place . at the checkout , i was about to sign the check without paying much attention as usual , but ( fortunately ) realized that the price was higher than expected . i asked for the check with each item and found out that they added N tip without telling us , and then gave us the second check which required another tip ( as if they did not add tip in the first place ) . what was more deceiving was that on the second check , the amount which included tip appeared as a " pre-tip amount " . it was only two of us - not even a group of N . next time when i went with my husband , they did not include tip in the first check . so we thought they probably made a mistake last time . a few days later , i went with my father again . they did the same thing - tried to make us pay tip twice in the same deceiving way . we realized that since we looked like tourists who don ' t know much about tipping , they tried to rip us off . i gently explained the owner about the situation . to my surprise , her reaction was extremely impolite . i remember how kind she was to us when we looked like locals , who can possibly be repeating customers . however , the way she dealt with this issue was completely different - perhaps she thought we are tourists who have little chance to come back . if only she had apologized , we wouldn ' t have made this such a big deal . i cannot trust food made by people who lack morality . they may have made a few more bucks by deceiving tourists , but have lost what is most important - trust . 
i go here often because it ' s convenient but this place can be either good or disappointing . the last time i went here was a disappointment . i ordered a large cheese with half mushrooms and the entire pizza was soggy . they use too much sauce and the mushrooms were not fully cooked . i keep telling myself i won ' t return but they ' re right up the street so i always try to give them another chance but i wouldn ' t recommend this place because when it ' s bad it ' s bad and you ' ll be mad at yourself for spending money on nasty pizza . 
the food was not bad however our waitress maria must of had a bad day . it seem that everything we asked for ( which at times were things we previously asked ) we got the idea that we were bothersome to her . she does not reflect the warmth from the rest of the staff there . next time i go , i gonna call to see if she ' s there . if she is , i ' m going elsewhere . 
you know i don ' t dole out N stars very often but this place was simply fantastic ! ! ! how in the world haven ' t i heard about this place before ? artisanal pizza menu rocks . salad selection rocks . small plates are phenomenal . offering a full vegan menu is fantastic . a great great concept ! might go back today again . we had the mushroom pizza with ricotta and truffle oil that was heavenly . pear salad with gorgonzola and baby greens salad with corn fritters . omg i love creativity on the menu ! ! ! ! small plates we tried were a fried mac cheese and cheesy cauliflower that were delightful . we really couldn ' t decide what to pick and wanted everything on the menu . and they have a full vegan menu ! how awesome is that ? ? ? ! ! ! this is currently the only new haven restaurant i ' d personally seek out going to as a destination vs . the " where should we go eat tonight " compromise kinda place . great inventive desserts s ' more creme br l e and more . really nice atmosphere and crowd too . a experience . 
the rumors are true , the tomato basil pizza is out of this world ! i also appreciated a slice of the deep dish cheese pizza . the breading was primo and very filling . we stumbled upon patzeria after wandering times square . the owner was incredibly nice , and even walked us through what was popular to help us decide . he even made sure we were enjoying our food . on the way out i thanked him for making probably one of the best slices of pizza i have ever had and he encouraged me to yelp and facebook the place . so here i am , saddened by the fact that i will be leaving tomorrow and going home to crappy pizza from cali . thanks for great time ny , but i gots to get home . like biggie , im going back , back to cali , cali . 
the N of us came here for a quick dinner last night . the restaurant is bigger than it looks . there are actually N seating areas . the menu isn ' t very big so we had a good sampling of what pies " n " thighs had to offer . fried chicken box w . collard greens side of corn bread - this was my meal and although i ' m not a huge fan of fried chicken , i thought this was good . i even ate half the skin . liked the collard greens . it did not feel like it was too heavy since it was cooked with pork . the corn bread was good , nice that it was toasted . other items included the fried catfish pulled pork chicken . no complaints . we all enjoyed it . a friend had the beans which he liked but may not do the pulled pork beans combo again as there were huge chunks of pork mixed into his beans already . the mac n cheese was good too especially with the extra touch of hot sauce . the watermelon salad ( sweet spicy ) was interesting in a good way . as for the pies , we ordered N kinds rhubarb , banana cream apples cheddar cheese . all tasted fine with the exception of the apples cheddar cheese combo . it ' s basically a room temperature slice of apple pie on top of a slice of cold unmelted cheese . everyone agreed that it was " wacky " but not bad . one person liked it . ( note i didn ' t partake in the pies as i was too full from the main dishes ) this is not something i ' d eat every week but it ' s a great chill type of vibe to enjoy a cheap fulfilling meal . the variety of sides makes it extra appealing . 
used the living social deal and enjoyed the N course dinner . the desert was a good twist on the standard indian ice cream . 
great food , service and drinks ! i tried the salt pepper calamari and my friend had the sliders , all was very good . place has a dark and intimate vibe , live music and a small dance floor . . . which is perfect for when you ' ve had one too many drinks , an easy thing to do here . definitely would go there again and recommend it . the only thing was the location , not too familiar with the area but there seemed to be a ton of dark bars etc . wouldn ' t walk around there alone at night if you ' re a girl but i guess you can say that about a few areas in nyc . 
i went to buddakan for the first time last week and very much disliked the experience . the amount of decent to great reviews of this place is shocking to me . we had reservations for N N and didn ' t get out of there until after N , this was not by choice . the lighting was dim , too dark for me . . . the host had to escort us to the table with instructions on how not to trip on steps in the dark . we ordered a pitcher of zengria which barely filled N small glasses half way . the pitcher was full of ice , so we really ordered icegria . needless to say , the drink was completely watered down . the waiter started to bring the food out slowly and with no rhyme or reason to how he was bringing it out . we realized when we asked if he could bring the appetizers and salads out first that all of the food is meant to be shared . the waiter explained , " yeah , you ladies ordered a lot of food . " well , no shit we ordered a lot of food , we thought a salad and an entree was appropriate . . . apparently not . so , we finally told him to bring it all out . i had the duck salad , not sure where the duck was . also , the salad was best described as backyard . the cashew chicken was as delightful as my local chinese food takeout place . the rest of my friends food was ok . i ' m glad the waiter finally brought out our bottle of wine after we finished . delightful . we all had doggie bags to re-live the buddakan experience at home . 
great israeli food . the shakshuka is legit and quite tasty , as is the humus . hope to come back for their happy hour . 
i found this place near lenox hill hospital . i ' ve never had a gyro which french fries in it and it was fantastic . the price was very reasonable , and i had two of mamas gyros . the spicy mayo was excellent and so was the barbecue . i would deathly recommend this if you looking for a reasonable takeout lunch . 
i was skeptical about going for italian because i have never ( except for pizza ) had good italian in the states , despite the large italian population in the philadelphia area . i have to say that the food was so tremendous that it overcame the hour i drove around for parking ( this is really hard to do ) , the extremely cramp seat i had and the extremely noisey inside . i shared the pasta special and the fish special ( tuna ) which were both excellent and fair priced . 
a great addition to the neighbourhood , with the friendliest staff of a restaurant we ' ve been to . the food is delicious , simply put . the tartes flamb s are a personal favorite of mine , but i ' m determined to try the entire menu over time . there ' s also a great selection of beers and wines . try the demi-peche ! jeremy and damien are excellent hosts , and myself and partner thoroughly enjoy each visit here . i highly recommend a trip to la cigogne . 
delicious ! ! ! ! i was walking down church street . . hungry and was drawn in from the cold by a delicious aroma and jazzy music . the salmon was incredible all N of us got it and it was perfection ! beautiful plate , fresh . . hit the spot ! excellent , excellent service and great food . absolutely recommend it . also tried the glugg i believe it ' s called a warm fragrant red wine concoction perfect this time of year ! 
really ? a N . N rating ? ! c ' mon yelpers . there ' s better pizza in ny than lucali for sure . for the crust , i wasn ' t impressed . i ' m a big fan of thin-crust pizza but it had too much of a charcoal burnt taste for me . you ' re probably saying , " yeah , it ' s cooked in wood-fired brick oven . " but that doesn ' t mean i want charcoal flavor on my pizza ! also , i feel like they take too much time getting the pie to you after it ' s taken out of the oven . i swear they spend N minutes sprinkling stuff on it after it ' s done . . . i prefer the pizza to be piping hot right out the gate . from a devoted pizza fan , i would recommend grimaldi ' s or lombardi ' s over lucali if you ' re looking for a good nyc pie . and if you ' re ever in los angeles , check out pizzeria mozza , probably the best pizza i ' ve ever tasted . 
soup dumplings . its worth the long line , sharing tables with strangers , and feeling cramped . 
this restaurant got so much worse than before ! i used to come here often when they opend that time was so good ! i came back here recently the foods are getting more like chinese food ? and so oily and somehow the design of the restaurant is very bad sad
this place is amazing ! ! ! first , the iced coffee " on tap " was delicious then there was the eggs in gnocchi . how has no one thought to put eggs on gnocchi before ? ! but also no one else would have done it as well -- the flavors were the perfect combination of rich and light . outdoor seating with lots of shade and room for strollers but you don ' t feel like the place is full of kids ( i appreciated both of those factors ) . i have never written a yelp review before but this new place was so good i had to share ! also , the manager was super nice ( and cute ! ) and made me feel right at home . 
i have never been treated in such a way before in my entire life - i have been to cp ' s several times and always enjoyed myself . for a celebratory dinner , i went in to see how long the wait for our party of N would be . the hostess referred to her manager , who ' s name is domingo - he asked if all of my party was here , my response was no but on their way . domingo told me he couldn ' t tell me until my entire party was there , fine no problem , can you give me an idea of how long it might be domingo ? his response , a smirk and a no . i asked again , " really you cant give me a general idea ? " " i ' m N years old , i don ' t have to tell you anything " . needless to say i was quite taken aback ( i ' m N ) . i laughed it off , thinking he was trying to be funny , he wasn ' t . when i asked again if he could give me an idea he smirked and said no . i asked what his problem was , and this is where it got interesting . he continued with the " i ' m N i don ' t have to answer you " schtick for some time . i told him i had never been treated in such a way and would take my business elsewhere . in front of the entire restaurant , and his staff he proceeded to threaten me , call me a " f cking white boy " and a tough guy , etc . at this point i became quite heated and said some less than reputable things and left in a fume . i called the restaurant a few hours later to get his name - his hostess told me domingo , he then quickly snatched the phone from her and called me a " stupid f ckin white boy , punk ass b tch , piece of sh t . . . . come back here you stupid white boy , come back and watch what happens to you " this was a grown man in a management position who acted like a schoolyard punk in front of his customers and his staff . i was and still am baffled at how this situation unfolded . i didn ' t realize that , because i am young , my money was any less significant to the business . so if you decide to go to cuban petes and you see a " N year old man " with a stupid little mustache and probably some various other mental issues , that ' s domingo - careful what you say or you might go to fisticuffs . 
i finally made it to this amazing little treasure of a place and now i see what every one is raving about . some of the tastiest home made italian food in the city . besides great food - place is casual and very relaxed - overall very enjoyable . can ' t wait to go back for more . 
the best falafel in the city . the first N times i tried to eat here , it was closed , but i ' m so glad i gave it a Nrd shot . as they say , Nrd time ' s a charm ! i had the great pleasure of dining here with the illustrious srini v . , and the food was so delicious that we both left feeling very full . while my waistline doesn ' t thank me , my tastebuds certainly do ! a N-star experience . edited N N N i have since returned , and the falafel was just as good as the first time . N stars , tried and true ! 
my first experience with ethiopian food was at ethiopian diamond in chicago . suffice it to say , it ' s hard to beat . . . mesob had some big shoes to fill ! the verdict not bad . we got our food pretty quickly , and the staff was unobtrusive but friendly . we ordered a meat sampler for N , which probably could have comfortably served N . the more i ate , the more sour the injera seemed to become , until it was almost an awkward mixture of sour , salty , and sweet . but not being an ethiopian food connoisseur , i ' m not sure if it ' s supposed to evolve like that . kind of like trendy clothes from h m - by the time they start falling apart , your inner fashionista says they were due for retirement anyway . the food at mesob tasted so good initially that i was full by the time it got funky . i could be talked into going there again , but i won ' t rush back . though it was good food , i was disappointed , having expected something great like i discovered my first time . 
the best brunch i ' ve ever had ! this place is amazing . the decor inside and outside is very parisian . we got seated right away on a friday afternoon but it was crowded inside but not uncomfortably crowded . i had the parisian za and my fianc ordered the salmon benedict . once we got our food we were in awe of how good it looked . once we started eating we could not stop . i finished my entire meal without hesitation and every bite was delicious . my fianc is a picky eater and he loved it as well . will definitely be back whenever we get the chance ) 
finally a restaurant with a real and capable chef , finally a lovely restaurant , owned and professional managed , everything we had here on our christmas eve dinner was delicious , fresh and wisely prepared . thank you guys , thank you chef ! 
i came here for a first date on a friday night . the moment you walk in you are hit with the smell of apples from the coat room as there are apples lining the walls . it was nice , my date was a bit late so i got to sit in the front room to wait . the crowd in that area was really old ( no offense old people ) but it seemed slightly stuffy to me . but when my date arrived and we entered the main restaurant i saw a lot more younger people and it had a bit more energy as well . we had the table near the back that had both seats facing the same direction which always kind of annoys me , especially tonight since my date was lookin so good . the food was delicious , service was amazing and decor was great . i would definitely come back here again , maybe just for a special occasion since it ' s a bit pricey . 
i really like his place . why only N stars , you ask ? well . . . . . i have visited this location plenty of times living in filter square and now rittenhouse . the staff is N N some being very helpful others a bit rude at times . for me it ' s not the N N service that alarms me as much as the inconsist smoothies . depending on which staff members make your pineapple kale smoothie determines if it ' s worth the or not ( place is a little pricey ) . also the soups are hit or miss so always ask to sample before buying one . now to the pre made salads ! i love the kale salad so yummy and healthy . i ' m also a fan of the quinoa salad with almond slices . the raw brussels sprouts salad is good but not for everyone you have to really dig earthy tastes . i like that they have fruit infused water out for you to help yourself . i also like that they recycle but they should be composting with the amount of fruit cores left over after all their fresh smoothie making ( yes philly has a compost service ) . so , bottom line i enjoy pure fare but it is sometimes not worth the money due to their inconsistency . 
i ' m giving N stars because the food is excellent . the staff is attentive . the deserts are delicious . the bartender is super friendly . we had a great time there and we will be back ! ! ! ! argentine gourmet at its finest ! ! ! ! i highly recommend ! ! ! 
wow , what a place ! this is my boyfriend and i ' s " go to " place for all holidays special occasions . it is a meat lover ' s dream ! start with the salad bar . there is a great selection , but be sure not to fill up ! definitely get some of the fresh mozzarella . as soon as your ready , flip the coaster on your table to green . the servers will immediately be at your table offering you some of the finest meats in the world . once there is enough on your plate , flip your coaster to red and begin enjoying . they also put a few side dishes on your table . they refill them as you eat . the atmosphere is wonderful and rather " fancy . " definitely a place to dress up . service is always great . only downside is that sometimes the cut of meat you want does not come around frequently . if this is the case , you can always request it and they will bring it right over . a little hefty of a price ( about N a person ) , but it is well worth it . definitely not a place for vegetarians . you can just get the salad bar , but they will still charge you about N for it . definitely head here for your next special occasion ! 
food is okay but the dessert deserves N star ! ! ! ! ! ! milk and cereal was superb . nice brunch place with a beautiful view . 
great food reasonably priced . the meatballs and octopus apps great pasta and the best tiramisu arber is the man at the bar
hidden nyc gem . have not had a bad meal or pizza here . owners are friendly and care about their business . pizzas are thin and crispy . their spicy homemade olive oil also adds a nice touch to your slices . great selection of wines and beers . only drawback is it could get really tight at busy hours and space is a bit tight . otherwise , i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who want to try great tasting italian dishes and quality pizza . 
very prompt and timely service , amazing food , and so affordable . i ordered chicken over rice for N bucks and was served within N minutes . the chicken was delicious and perfectly cooked , the rice was zesty and went very well with the chicken . it was also served with a few slices of naan and some lettuce . i would highly recommend that you use the white sauce that they give you . . it ' s amazing and makes the food taste even better . the serving size is pretty big . . so you can definitely share with someone and you both will be satisfied N . the guys at the cart are friendly and funny and generally very pleasant people . N dollars for a dinner that i was too full to even finish ! also not unhealthy food at all . you should definitely check it out . 
love this starbucks . friendly and knowledgeable baristas , clean store . 
certainly a pretty good introduction for peruvian food for me . the atmosphere is great for a date since it is dark and intimate . the service was alright but not as great as it could have been . the portions were humongous and you definitely get your money ' s worth here . since it was my first time here , i didn ' t realize just how big the portions were . i ordered the chupe de camarones to start . it was a wonderfully scrumptious and hearty soup . it was tomato based , served very hot , and very spicy . there were plenty of delicious shrimp and one gigantic one ( possibly a langoustine ? ) . i also shared the matador combo , which the waiter said serves two , but in reality , could probably serve four . it was huge . chicken , rice , beans , french fries , hot dog slices , and a mixed veggie salad . it was quite tasty , just too big too finish . finally for dessert , i very much enjoyed their tres leches cake with crispy banana slices on top . 
i have been looking forward to going to blend on the water since my family gave it rave reviews . i was there on monday and absolutely loved it . the hostess was very nice and inviting , our waitress alexis was awesome . she made our night very enjoyable . the drinks were great and the food was phenomenal . the ambiance was great . definitely returning sooner than later . 
had never been to old version of tmg . a shame , as the N of us enjoyed every dish - and a great old fashioned . staff was friendly and understandably rushed - it was saturday night . . . but proficient . can ' t praise this place enough , based on our experience . we will be back for the plate de jour . 
great experience once again . i have been enjoying the delicious food at the revere for more than N years . wonderful , polite , and friendly service . bacon dusted calamari is a must every visit absolutely delicious . entree was the slizzing Noz new york strip steak which i requested rare and was cooked perfectly with and very entertaining presentation . great people , good food , classic music played while you enjoy your food . perfect night to relax and have a good time and great food . a few weeks ago was a very unsettling experience due to customers that were absolutely obnoxious and had no class what so ever . a group of about N women whom ordered the unlimited crab legs and took unlimited to another level . after about N dishes each of crab legs along with ago customers eating them to , the restaurant unfortunately ran out which is very capable of happening because of the " unlimited " part . these women made a scene when trying to order the Nth dish of crab legs and was informed theu had sold out . they started making fun of their gay waiter who is awesome gay or not . calling him a fairy and etc . i could have smacked them right in the face . the owner being the good man that he is offered dessert on the house and percentage off the bill . they continued to act like classless ghetto hood rats left the restaurant bitching like little children shorted the waiter on the check and no tip . thank god they choose to get rid of the crab legs on thursdays because now those type of uneducated , immature women do not come back . take yourself to a chinese buffet and stop giving this restaurant a bad name . anyway love the revere thanks for all the good times . 
one of the best pizzaria in the western hemesphere the line you will wait on is worth it and should also bottle and sell there smell
i don ' t really think bar needs another review . the place is just awesome for food , drinks , groups , whatevs . the pizza is so damn legit , i can ' t even think straight . i haven ' t been for the clubbin ' . just the belly-related activities . 
my wife and i take the kiddies out every weekend , so we frequent a variety of restaurants , both good and bad . spuntino is definitely in the bad category . this may the most ill-conceived restaurant we ever experienced . the decor is confused and the menu dis-jointed . we ordered a variety of items including a caesar salad , calamari , salsiccia stromboli , zuppa de pesce and chicken milan . the salad was warm and the crispers were soggy . both the chicken and calamari were fried to death and the zuppa de pesce got my wife sick at her stomach . the stromboli consisted of mostly onions and peppers and two measly pieces of italian sausage and a sliver of mozzarella cheese . the only two positives were the server , a young man named william and the polenta fries . overall , the food was terrible and about N over priced . 
i ' m no expert on indian food . in fact , my exposure has been fairly limited . that said , what i ' ve had the pleasure of eating at karma has always been tasty . my co-workers and i sometimes go there for their lunch buffet , which gives my inexperienced taste buds a lot to try . i ' m a big fan of the chicken tikka masala , which seems to be a staple when it comes to the buffet . and the bread that comes with the meal is delicious and always nice and warm . if you ' re looking for a great place to try some different indian dishes , karma ' s lunch buffet is a good choice . 
we went based on yelp reviews with two others who need gluten free pizza - both the gf and the regular pizza lived up to the reviews ! started with arugula salad and avocado with balsamic drizzle- fantastic ! great location with a garage right there in case the street is full - tucked away in the alley with a small quiet patio in back . love that many foods are local and farm to table - but most of all loved the pizza ! 
one of my favorite places to eat in philly , i come here often . . . as well as bring others too . i usually get the pho sate and some bok choy on the side . but i also love their lime chicken . the inside of the restaurant is nice and it feels much more spacious and nice than the chinatown location . i ' ve also gotten take-out . with so many memorable meals here i wonder why i rarely have to wait for a table . 
pizza was ok here . we got a normal cheese pie and then one that was basically the supreme . the supreme was super soggy and the cheese one was ok . i rather go to lombardi ' s or artichoke ' s . at least you could walk over to brooklyn ice cream factory for dessert . 
great food and fantastic atmosphere ! we go to this restaurant or order food to our home regularly ! this was my first experience with indian food , and i would recommend it to anyone ! 
i have been to many traditional indian pakistani restaurants in atlanta , new jersey , new york . i can say with confidence that the food at sunshine is the best . their kababs , chicken boti , karahi an d fried fish is to die for . the restaurant has nice decor and the owners are always very cordial and courteous . i trust their business and their prices for catering . i am so glad that i have found sunshine palace . it satisfies my craving for quality , decent priced food . 
waiting in a long line with high expectations only to be disappointed . for the N . N price of a sub i would expect to receive a sandwich where the steak and cheese filled the roll . there are plenty of sandwich shops in mass . n . y . that make far superior cheese-steaks , don ' t waste your time or your money . additionally if pat ' s continues to skimp on those ingredients i don ' t think they will have to worry about those long lines for long ! 
should not be eating the burgers here but sooo tasty ! 
just a update did hear back from the owner kudo ' s there , he stated that there was a misunderstanding with staff of sampling beers before ordering . sadly because of the unpredictablilty and my N strikes your out rule my star still stands at N . 
came here between games during the glastonbury soccer tournament . what a fantastic place ! we pulled into the parking lot and saw a tiny diner in what looks like an old trolley car . it has about N bar stools and N tables . we waited in line for no long than N minutes . the boys and i loved the menu - pancakes and omelettes . very reasonably priced . i loved the side of homemade salsa with my eggs . would definitely come back here next time we have a soccer tournament . 
i ' m a halal guy addict . be careful , you may get hooked . 
we held our family christmas dinner here this year . the atmosphere was delightful , the service exceptional , and the menu offers a variety of options , all of which we ' re flavorful and very well prepared . it wasn ' t our first experience there , and most certainly won ' t be the last . 
ramen places are always on the list of places to try so my friends and i stopped here for dinner . there was a relatively long wait to get seated . the waiter wasn ' t too enthusiastic or anything he just did his job at least . he took our orders , refilled our drinks , and brought us the check when asked . however , we had a party of six and one of the orders was dropped for some reason but was still served about N-N minutes after everyone . the ramen itself was pretty good . it wasn ' t too bland or salty . i ordered the totto spicy ramen but it wasn ' t as spicy as i hoped . overall a good experience though . also it is cash only . 
if i could give six stars i would . my husband and i stumbled across this place while house hunting in astoria . what a fantastic suprise . we had the peasant salad , lemon potatoes , grilled octopus , and the swordfish . everything was really , really good and as other reviewers have stated . . . very fresh . can ' t wait to go back ! 
one if the best places in newyork to take a group for a fun italian meal . it gets crowed , so make a reservation . food is very good , not necessarily great . everything is family-style portions , so we ordered N entrees for N people and had more than enough . for desert , the chocolate decadence was huge and all loved it . service was attentive , but we never felt rush . server made good suggestions . somewhat loud , but we were able to carry in conversations , and hear each other ok . i really like the downstairs dining area . every table has enough room so you don ' t feel too crowded in . 
i ' ve been meaning to get around to this review for a while , but was prodded into action by the recent closing after a failed health inspection . about that i have two girls , N and N who i love very much . and i wouldn ' t think twice about taking them to di fara the day they open back up . dom marches to his own beat and i ' m sure that runs afoul of the type-a types at the sep of health , who have their job to do and an important one . but whatever grade the inspectors gave him , the pizza is a bona fide a . thin , blistered , great cheese sauce balance , all christened with grana and basil by dom himself the minute it comes out of the oven . truly great the good news about the dust up with the health dept is that maybe the line will get a little shorter . alway my biggest obstacle in deciding whether to make a trip down to ave j . 
the food is authentic and fantastic . the owner and the chef are native jamaicans and the food tastes as if you were on the island itself . i had the jerk chicken which was fantastic , but the jerk shrimp was out of this world . i ' m a weekly customer . 
the chicken and grits could possibly solve all the worlds problems , it is absolutely absurd how good this is . 
stunning interior decor . very friendly and welcoming waitstaff . service is quite fast and on par . very affordable menu . i tried the pho dish and ribs on sugar cane . the pho dish was different and unique from all other phos ive had . it ' s actually worth a try . the ribs on sugar cane was a surprise . this place makes any food look sexy . and the taste . . . it was just simply heaven in my mouth . it gave me a hard-on . overall the place is dope . expectations surpassed . got more than what i asked for . 
very , very cramped ( lost count of the times servers kicked my chair and knocked my elbows ) and noisy . food does not compensate for the uncomfortable environment - standard steaks , not particularly generous serving size . really awful wine list too . if you ' re looking to have a few drinks with friends , soak up a vibrant atmosphere , and eat a little while doing this then this wouldn ' t be a bad place for you . if you ' re serious about food however , rather than a scene , then don ' t even consider it . 
for the first time , i went to south philly to conduct " the ultimate philly cheese steak challenge " with my boyfriend and my sister . the first thing i thought of when i went to geno ' s was that it was a lot cleaner , brighter , and newer looking than pat ' s . quite honestly , pat ' s just looked like a run-down , traditional cheese steak stand . when i went to geno ' s the line was not long at all . i really appreciated how they don ' t have the ordering system like pat ' s . we bought cheese steak - with whiz and onions - and fries . i absolutely hated the fries . maybe it was their own discrete way of saying , " get cheese fries , " but the regular fries were tasteless . it tasted like fries that had been stored in a closet full of mothballs . yuck . nonetheless , the cheese steak was fine . the steak was juicier , which meets my definition of a good steak . i also tasted a lot more onion in my sandwich . so all in all , three stars for having a better sandwich , or their specialty , but having a horrible side dish - such as fries ! ( 
bbq bbq bbq ! do try the donkey punch-a rum drink that makes everything better . ordered the burger , fried green tomato , half rack of ribs , mac n cheese . . . everything was spectacular ! i , for one , welcome our gentrifying overlords if it means that such great food will continue to pervade the outer boroughs ! just don ' t go on live band nights , cacophony is a word that i don ' t use often but in this case it is prudently apt . . . horribly loud really bad music . great food though ! cheers ! 
i ' m excited to have a new coffee shop in the area . normally i do breakfast at madelines , but it ' s been hit or miss lately so we came down to check out milk honey . their breakfast sandwich and egyptian eggs were excellent . it ' s a great spot to relax and chat or get some work done over a cup of coffee . it ' s nice and bright and there ' s lots of space . 
great customer service ! relaxing place , will return . 
service is slow but the food is tasty . 
i recommend this place for a smaller group of people rather than a large group . its a big spot , but they really pack it in . my favorite thing here is the bar steak with bearnaise . it comes with mixed greens or fries . the last few times i ' ve come here have been in larger groups and the steak was undercooked . i like my steak medium , medium-rare and it came out pretty much blue . so i recommend if you like a medium rare to just get medium . the calamari is also perfectly fried and the sauce that comes on top is spicy , but not overwhelming . the beer list is pretty diverse . they had ommegang sythe sickle which is brewed in ny and tastes reeeal smooth with dinner . my favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere . i always enjoy coming here with friends regardless of if my food isn ' t totally up to my expectations . 
i kept hearing about buttermilk channel . the new york times ran an article , some women were gushing about it on the subway , and then i passed by it not long ago while going down court street . my nose sniffed a fad-laden , perhaps pretentious and maybe not so enjoyable experience , but boy , was i wrong . buttermilk channel truly pleased in every sense of the term . i kept searching the menu looking for something to criticize or scoff at , but it was not possible . truly new american offerings are presented in a thoughtful and coherent manner that keeps with the uniqueness of a place like this . i went with a couple of friends on a sunday evening and we were in for a real treat . i ' ll start first by saying that they don ' t accept reservations for parties under five . i guess it ' s popular enough , and totally excused based on the quality of the experience i had thereafter . we cleverly arrived around N Npm to wait for them to open at N Npm , thereby successfully avoiding a wait of any kind . we were promptly seated at N Npm and it was all excellent from there . impressively so , by about N Npm , the place was packed and it already appeared that a wait list had materialized . the menu offers a truly impressive variety of simple , but elegant dishes that are sure to please . we started with the sweet potato goat cheese croquettes and an organic green salad to start , both of which were lovely . i went off on a mini-tangent about how nice it is to see sweet potato used in a more savory approach - fantastic . we were served a few yorkshire puddings instead of bread on the table , which was great - i had the duck meatloaf as my entree , which was presented beautifully on a layer of creamed spinach celery root , and in a pretty generous portion . another person in my party had the lamb romaine salad which looked delicious and everyone was really pleased . the wine and beer list is extensive and made to make any native new yorker proud - all their beers are new york state , and a handful of their wines are too - mostly long island and finger lakes . we ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of north fork wine which was exquisite and i couldn ' t get over how lovely the presentation of everything was . the restaurant itself is a bright , buttery yellow space that is sun-splashed in the early evening and warmed by dark wood floors , exposed brick and tasteful lighting and candles . the prices are very reasonable for the caliber of a place like this and i was really satisfied above and beyond with everything . overall , buttermilk channel is truly superb and i can give it my highest recommendation . 
very nice place , service and food . if you are visiting soho and want a fair price good cuisine restaurant to eat , you won ' t be disappointed . 
stellar cocktails , cheese board is wonderful . i haven ' t eaten dinner there yet but i plan too . the staff knows their product , so important for a restaurant . i enjoy their patio area except for when the dumpster is full behind the building and it smells . 
food was great . the tartar and the ribs were my two favorites , and the donuts for dessert are a must . the food did take a little while to come out , however . and it seems like there ' s only one or two waitresses handling all the tables even on a busy night , so sometimes it ' ll be hard to grab their attention when you need something . otherwise , this is a great restaurant . 
loved this place . nice ambiance for a date or dinner and drinks with friends . i came here N nights ago with girlfriends . we ordered N starters and entree to share . the bursts was excellent , hot chips with blue cheese were great , but my favorite was the pot of mussels which was in a white wine sauce . it was plenty of food for us N and of course we tried some of their specialty drinks ! ! would definitely come back . 
awesome atmosphere and outdoor seating . best burgers and chicken sandwiches for a great deal . most certainly recommend . great service ! 
booked online the day before through opentable an was seated within N minutes of arriving . the food was very good , as was the atmosphere , and the service . our server , caitlin , made this a special occasion for the entire family . i had the ribeye , which was excellent . would definitely go back . 
looong overdue review . . . i ' ve been eating at sharky ' s for N years now . they have fantastic food and the wings are in my top N . i like them hot and sharky ' s wing sauce is not only hot , but it ' s flavorful . it ' s not very aesthetically pleasing , but i ' m not going for the atmosphere , i ' m going for awesome wings , great apps , and cold , cheap beer . 
soooo good ! my family is from thailand and i ' ve never been able to find khao man kai in the city--and there ' s is great ! they ' re thai iced tea is fresh , made with condensed milk and amazing ! they ' re larb , pad ka naa , pad thai , pad see ew , and som tum are all very good also . definitely come here if you want more authentic thai food on Nth ave . 
i love moshulu ( when i say the name right ) ! i really like the atmosphere and am very glad this is the place my husband took me when we first met . even though they got our orders wrong in N , we go back every year for our anniversary and it gets more wonderful each time . i wish it wasn ' t so expensive but the food is absolutely amazing ! i do like the service , very attentive , but as someone else wrote , sometimes a little too attentive . i did use the groupon last year which was great but while wanting one now and looking for one , i can ' t find one ( . it is well worth the dress up and trip back into the city for this girl . 
love this place ! wonderful food and drinks ! 
the only reason to go to bushwick
something for everyone . i can honestly say that it ' s one of my favorite restaurants in new york . there truly is something for everyone on the menu . personal favorites - always . . . 
i am a foody and this place is great . i always get something new each time i go and i am never disapointed .
