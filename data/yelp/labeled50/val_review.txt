the tables are small and cluttered , adding the chips and salsa and guacamole made the space even more sparse . . . but the kicker was when the waiter brought our food and handed it to us . . . and we were left holding it while we tried to make room for it on the table ourselves . . . . poor service , to say the least . . . they could ' ve at least cleared away the unused table setting . . . we tipped anyway but will not be returning
mcgillin ' s is a very local place with a very after-work sort of crowd . being a an out of towner , i was skeptical at first because i didn ' t want to seem like i was intruding on a place where the bartender seemed to know everyone ' s name . that said , i was extremely ( and pleasantly ) surprised when the crowd made me and my boyfriend feel right at home . the bartender chatted with us and made sure that we were given as much attention as his regulars . at one point , i was sitting in the only free chair at the bar and my boyfriend had to stand and someone got up so we could sit together . that ' s quite a rarity in new york , where free seats are usually nabbed in a heartbeat and ( lazy ) people are keen on keeping them until they want to go home . the patrons and employees have certainly done the title of ' the city of brotherly love ' justice , and i will certainly be back when i ' m after a loud , i-can-finally-relax-after-work vibe . 
i ' ll keep it quick . this place is excellent . a must try ! 
pho ha is a place you should only come for one thing and one thing only . everything else on the menu is hit or miss , or a disaster on a plate . we practically go here every weekend so we have experimented with different orders on the menu . i am also very picky about vietnamese food and tend to over-scrutinize it . the spring rolls are one of those hit or miss . some days they will be pretty fresh and tasty . and other days it looks and tastes like it had been sitting on the kitchen counter all day ( the rubbery skin is a dead giveaway ) . i also happen to be viet - i know what fresh spring rolls should taste and look like . it ' s funny how the restaurant tries to pull the wool over an unsuspecting customers ' eyes with the term " fresh . " so you may think that i hate the restaurant based on the previous rant . on the contrary ! the large bowl of pho is pretty damn good ( and cheap ) and in fact , is the only reason to come here . if you psyche yourself into deviating from the pho menu then you , my friend , are a gambling man . don ' t gamble , the house always wins . oh , being a byob place sure does help with ratings . 
best in new york city ! ! ! 
i am so disappointed with this place i don ' t even know where to start . we decided to come here because this place has a lot of reviews and figured we are making the right choice . when we arrived there was no one to greet us . the host or maybe manager owner was too busy talking to his friends at the bar to even notice us . when we went in search of someone to take care of us the guy we spoke to told us to wait for the manager to finish talking to his friends . really ? okay ! ! so eventually the manager pointed us to a table , didn ' t even walk us there but we sat down and patiently waited for him to bring the menus to us which took a while since he went back to talking to his friends . my boyfriend wanted to go up to the host desk to get the menus himself since it seemed that the manager was too busy to take care of the customers that pay his bills . as we sat waiting for the menus he finally made it over but instead of being nice to us he attacked us by saying " don ' t push the table against the wall because its new and it will get scratched " then he proceeds to point his finger at my boyfriend and saying " that means you " since my boyfriend was resting his elbow on the table and his arm and shoulder against the wall . we felt so unwanted there but we decided we wont let that ruin our night . as the night kept moving forward the people that came after us get service before us , the crispy duck was so dry we didn ' t even want to feed it to my dog in fear of it choking and as we are paying the bill the busser is yelling at us that they don ' t take debit cards . cash only . could there have been a note somewhere before we came in ? we were lucky we had cash on us . i worked in the restaurant industry and know that the cash only places lie on their taxes for tax evasion . i hope irs audits you guys . what i am saying is that this place is super over rated by hipsters that don ' t really like to travel for good thai food . i will never come back here because this was a waste of my money . 
never had such a horrible experience ! ! we have been going to sumo for years . the food has always been decent and the service has been slowly going downhill . . . . now it is absolutely horrible . we enjoy byob restaurants and often bring bottles of wine and a bottle or two of martinelli ' s ( sparkling apple cider ) for our kids . we dined at sumo last night and upon completion of our meal the servers asked what they should do with our ice bucket . i said we would take care of recorking the N wine bottles and the kids would drink the cider . the servers smiled and took the bucket away - at the time i assumed to dry our bottles . instead they took it to the counter and started pouring and drinking our wine right in the restaurant . i stood and asked loudly why they were drinking our wine and one server ( funny enough the one drinking the martinelli ' s ) made the disgusting gesture of putting her finger into her mouth ( as if to suggest throwing up ) . three servers were all drinking and laughing clearly at our expense ( little did they know they were drinking two N bottles of wine and a N bottle of cider ) . we immediately removed the tip completely from our check and wrote all over the bill that we hoped they enjoyed drinking their tip . we will never go back . 
the food N you know i would thought the food here was absolutely the best since it ' s recommended by so many people . plus being the high class expensive restaurant but i was completely wrong and i don ' t understand why it ' s so crowded all the time . we order the simply medium rare steak and fries for breakfast and it was horrible . after we waited N minutes the steak came out to be over medium and it was completely dried even with the melted butter mixed together . i didn ' t want to tell the waiter to get us another dish and waited longer so we ate it . didn ' t enjoyed it though . the price N the price for the simply steak and fries was N that tasted horrible . here ' s a picture yelp . com biz photos kgpo the restaurant N there is absolutely zero parking anywhere near this place and you ' ll have to either walk or get a taxi here . it ' s always crowded and we had to make reservations for a table and still we had to wait for N minutes . now here ' s the part that got disappointed with the waiter service . my waiter was a smart ass and he asked us some rude questions when we order and before we get to answer them he would do it for us . he must be having some sort of a bad morning and it seems he ' s taking it out on the customers like ourselves . so we asked for a different waiter and when the first waiter walked by he would stare at us with the angry eyes . 
three of us went for quizzo on a rainy night . we got the vegetarian combination - which was alot of food ! all of it really good . they have some great ( cheap ) drink specials . and , large round bar is great for people watching . friendly and inexpensive spot . 
after talking to my fillipino friend about fillipino food yesterday , i was in the mood for fillipino food . came here with my gf on a thursday night at around N Npm . it was a busier than i had anticipated . the hostess was friendly , greeted us at the door and told us that all tables were booked at least Npm , so we opt to sit on the wall ( they tables bar tables along the wall . ) we had the arroz caldo , bulalo hash , and chori burger with a san miguel beer . arroz caldo - similar to any other asian congee ( or rice porridge ) with a soft boiled egg and fried tripe . - delicious with a spritz of lemon juice . bulalo hash - a soup stew with a couple of pieces of very tender beef , some vegetables , and a large helping of bone marrow right from the bone . - being of asian descent , this dish reminded me of a home cooked meal . it really hit the spot . the beef was very tender and flavorful and if you appreciated the rich fattiness of bone marrow , you will not be disappointed . chori burger - this was one of the biggest , juicest , yummiest burger i have ever had . i was barely able to finish the entree and i usually have a big appetite . there were parties eating kamayan dinner , which is family style without utensils . looked really interesting , i would like to come back to try that one day , along with the baluuuut ! service N N food N N decor N . N N ( place was very cramped and dark ) would i come back ? hell yes oh yes , cash only
don ' t waste your time here . they say Nmin N . N hours later they were still telling us Nmin . for something you could get pretty much anywhere in new york . 
possibly one of the worst meals i ' ve ever had from a restaurant that i always loved . mialino , where have you gone ? and service manager , timothy mckevitt should be ashamed of himself too . you might have made a bad meal a little bit better . 
slider style burgers annoyingly small . wish they had option to get a full burger . also wish there were more topping options . who doesn ' t like to dress their burger up with tons of toppings ? ? at least the fries were good , plentiful . and had some interesting sauces . 
there is plenty of parking behind the restaurant . they greet you and make you feel welcomed . i love the N roll special during lunch hours between Nam-Npm , which comes with a soup and a salad for only N . N the sushi is fresh and plentiful . seaweed salad is amazing . its byob ( bring your own beer or wine if you prefer ) . i definitely recommend it , i eat there all the time . thus , it is a really good sushi spot . 
amazing sushi place , very well decorated and i just love this place . very innovative with all the new sushi selections and tasty to say the least . this is my go to place if i want to have sushi , for sure . 
really great food , huge portion sizes and fresh ingredients , long , long wait times
so i finally came here with some friends last night and my experience was pretty good . i ordered the spinach ravioli and the thai chicken lettuce wraps , which were pretty tasty . i like how it has that adorable modern N ' s diner look about it . it sits in a great location in the heart of old city . one day , i would love to try their brunch menu to see what it ' s like . my only complaint is it ' s a bit pricy . bottom line , i would come back again if i ' m in the area and in the mood for various global cuisines offered here . 
my favorite place on mulberry . beautiful place , amazing food and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly never allowing you to feel rushed or in the way . prices are on par with other of the nicer places on mulberry . i recommend this place to any ny local or tourist . 
i ' ve spent a lot of time in princeton for never having lived here or gone to the university . when i think of princeton , though , this place comes to mind . a dark woody pub , that would furrow any economist ' s brow with no mid-range priced eats ( either things like N burgers or N steaks ) . when relaxing here after work , i ' ve been more on the side of the burger and beer . there ' s also a semi-outdoor patio , a bar , and a formal dining room . 
locale fantastico , accogliente personale gentilissimo ! la vera e ottima cucina italiana all ' estero ! complimenti ! - ) ) continuate cosi ! 
a couple of us came here for a special occasion and it was pretty fun . unfortunately , we were seated on the lower level , so it wasn ' t as great as it could have been . there is a live band that plays on the first level so it would have been awesome to sit up there with the band . anyway , we had a few mojitos ( yummy ! ) so i guess it was alright . we tried the ceviche , emapanadas , ropa vieja , and the churrasco . the ceviche was really good and so was the churrasco . everyone on yelp raves about the ropa vieja , and while it was good , i just liked the flavors of the churrasco much better . i ' m sure we ' ll return for round N some time , and hopefully be seated where the band plays ! also , there is an old dude that rolls cigars at the front of the restaurant - not sure if you can buy them though . but why else would they have him ? ! 
came here with a group of coworkers for happy hour . i must say , i am a fan of philly ' s happy hour specials - decent margaritas for half price and tasty appetizers . came back with the boyfriend for some delicious tacos and more margaritas . also enjoyed the platanos appetizer . will definitely return ! 
carmines used to be good food and a good time . after eating there monday N N N , i realized it ' s only a good time . the waits are long and used to be worth it . my favorite was the calamari , but this time it was overcooked and like rubber bands . we ordered pasta pomodoro ( supposed to have prosciutto in it ) and couldn ' t find any meat . the waiter said it must be there and we asked him to find some . he couldn ' t and took it back to the kitchen , returning with the same half eaten dish with some chopped prosciutto . we had the best seat in the house at the window on the first floor , but the food was not what it used to be . so long carmines--- bob doherty river edge nj
this is a N . N place for me . unsure why everyone raves about the burger here . it ' s a big burger for sure but nothing special imo . certainly not in the top N that i seem to see everywhere . i do love the quaint atmosphere and any place that serves magners gets a nod from me ( albeit it ' s from a bottle ) . 
go once to say you did . food was okay , nothing spectacular-- to be honest , in new haven , that ' s the equivalent of bad . a lot of other shops here now have a better burger . . there just isn ' t anything particular special at louis . sorry , i know you ' re the original , but time to shake things up a little . 
my girlfriend and i have been here N times now . the decor is very outdated . it looks like my great grandmas house . it feels sticky and dirty in the booths and the worst part is the food . i will never return . gordon ramsey should drop in for kitchen nightmares . 
stopped in for ice cream take out last night , as i have done periodically over the past N years , although havent gone in a while . was pleasantly surprised at the service i recieved , yound ladies at counter very polite courteous , manager ceasar very helpful , and friendly , surprisingly knew the special touches we like ( no marshmello sauce , extra peanut butter etc ) the ice cream was fresh made right . restaurant clean bathrooms in order . we also love to come after nine for half price appetizers . 
amazing ! cheap and seriously so good ! it ' s a hole in the wall , no joke , but it ' s worth the wait in line to try the delishness this man makes ! 
bbq chicken is delightful and the mac and cheese compliments the meal . service is very friendly and always fairly fast . the atmosphere is much better in the downstairs part . very comfortable and diner-y . 
great food , but a bit pricey given some alternatives in the city . really nothing to complain about here . service is fine , but nothing special obviously the delicious ramen and solid buns are the draw here . 
i hate pushy restaurant staff and these guys were way too pushy . . . first off , the scene inside is like a bit tacky . . . the staff are emotionless . and despite a half empty restaurant , they kept pushing . i ' m not even done chewing the last bite of my appetizer when the entrees show up . i ' m not done drinking my beer when they grab the bottle . i place my fork on the plate at the end of my meal and someone runs up and grabs it . my girlfriend has a half full drink and the waiter brings the check ? ! ? ! wouldn ' t you ask if we wanted another drink ? dessert ? coffee ? watch willie degel or robert irvine and learn how to build check averages instead of rushing people out the door when your restaurant is empty ! the food was mediocre and the waiter came back to our seats at the bar multiple times trying to collect the check . i don ' t get the rush rush mentality . i felt like this was chinese takeout ( N minutes ! ) . there was no bartender and everyone seemed to have multiple roles . they were completely emotionless and the food and service are simply lackluster , at best . skip this one ! 
worst experience ever . we had a reservation for two for N N on a friday night . we got there a little early ( around N N ) and checked in . they told us a bunch of tables were getting their checks , so it would just be about N-N minutes and that we could wait at the bar ( even though there was not an inch of room to move ) . so why were we still standing there at N N with no sign of a table ? ? the worst part was that they were seating larger parties of N-N -- as if they weren ' t seating us because two people would be " wasting " a bigger table . the hostesses and hosts were rude and i heard them whispering about us after i complained that the table was taking a long time . also overheard customers complaining at the bar because the bartender charged them a totally different amount for the bottle of wine than the menu said , at which point they had to get the manager . i will never come here again . 
fast service , clean presentation . the portion was good for its price . i would definitely come here again ! 
if you ' re hanging around south st . but need a minute to ditch the tourists , this is the joint . great stuff , great beer , cool crowd , ( but not too-cool-for-school ) . really nice . 
i must say i ' m not a fan of intelligentsia coffee , it ' s too light and acidic for me , but this place does have the best i have had . i have been wanting to come here for a while and i finally made it . the space is tiny and i probably should have got a treat but didn ' t . this place is a great alternative to starbucks . 
i am from shanghai , i didn ' t think the xiao long bao here is as good as shanghai . other snacks are also very good , such as spring roll , scallion pancake and pork fried or boiled dumplings . i will come again with my friends . 
this place is a well oiled machine . it ' s clean , professionally run , the food is great and so is the service . giselle handled a bar mishap like a star and gets accolades for being terrific . we ' ve been on a tapas kick recently , and this is far superior to both tertulia and soccarat ( in soho ) . 
somebody , somewhere is going to hate me for not giving this place a N . maybe it was all the hype and building-up , but it was kind of a disappointment ! props to the menu - it looked fantastic . a ridiculously large selection of empanadas ( yummy ! ) , as well as other food ! we enjoyed bloody marys and plantain chips with guac while waiting for our food . everything was delicious . . . . . . . but when the empanadas came . . . they were just alright . i ' ve had much better empanadas at even places like cuba ( restaurant ) --these were a little dry , a little thrown-together , a little fast-food . we ordered eight empanadas between the three of us , and none were mind-blowing . service was okay , decor and seating was okay , but nothing was that impressive . i ' d come back because it ' s cheap , fast , and good for groups - you also don ' t have to " commit " to one main course , because you can build your own meal from a variety of different empanadas . but unbelievably delicious ? nah . 
our waiter was funny but fast t y
this review is based only on the clubbing scenario , as we reach at N am and danced till the end . after having a bit of trouble finding street parking on spring garden st , we paid about N per girl , N per guy cover charge at entrance . but the club had great ambience , nice crowd and the uv lights just made everything look magickey ! the music was a mix of pop and trance , and kinda okay . true , it ' s a bit crowded , but when you ' re drunk , you barely care about it . overall , i would like to come again to try their food and more drinks . 
the pizza was decently good but i was instantly turned off by the lack of sanitary standards ! the people at the register were incredibly carefree about alternating between handling money and putting pizza slices in the oven without washing their hands in between or wearing gloves . i was so disgusted . 
i absolutely loved it . i ' ve been to some really fantastic ramen places in tokyo , and the ramen here definitely transported me back . the taste was completely authentic and worth the wait to me ( but i will allow that thanks to my friend ' s knowledge of the wait , we showed up before we got really hungry , and then walked around for a bit ) . i ' ve only been the once , so it may not be as consistently amazing as my experience , but it was exactly what i was looking for and more . i ' ll definitely be going back any time i miss japan too much ! 
good food at a reasonable price . 
came hoping for italian food , but the downstairs restaurants were packed . for some reason , the hosts could not give us an accurate wait time and instead told us to go upstairs to the bar . the bar had good beer but a very small selection of italian foods - no pizzas or pastas . the food was okay - nothing special . i ' d recommend shopping at eatily , and maybe having a glass of wine and cheese downstairs , but there are better , cozier italian restaurants all over the city . 
food was great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! first time having brazilian food and loved it . looking forward to it soon . . . . 
i don ' t normally write reviews , but i had to give a shout out to my favorite bar and restaurant in brooklyn . the deals on drinks and food are incredible , especially in a city where most of us live check to check . the food is fantastic . i would recommend the waffles or the chicken fingers . the greek salad is great too ! i try to get to this bar as much as possible . the owners are the nicest people , and are very accessible . the service is awesome ! strongly strongly recommend ! ! ! 
best fries in the city ! no matter what diet you are on or how you feel about carbs , , , , you just have to let it go ! ! ! i love the sauce samples they give you when you are ordering . very friendly service ! the place is a hole in the wall and very hot . so beware ! 
i have nothing but the best to say about eurogrill ! ! ! the atmosphere and super friendly staff makes you feel right at home . combine that with the amazing food and you can ' t get any better ! ! ! there ' s no doubt that i will absolutely keep coming back as often as i can ! ! spread the word beacuse eurogrill is where its at ! ! ! ! ! 
super expensive to bring your family to . i have N children and it cost a fortune . place was very clean , and i ' m sure prices are in line with other similar yogurt places , but i ' d rather have plain ice cream any day of the week . 
the food taste ok , but the delivery service is awful , the worst . the driver either forgets an item or doesn ' t have enough change to give back . if he needs to bring back either food or change , he takes forever to do so . this restaurant is off my list ! i will never order from this place again . . . . oh yeah , i forgot to mention the fact that i order a slice of cake with my order and it looked as if a bite has been taken from it . not good ! 
went here for my birthday last year and thought it was very good . the setting in side is really romantic and intimate , lots of exposed brick , which is always good ! the food itself is very good and solid , not the best i ' ve ever had , but still worth it very flavorful . 
it wasn ' t exactly the type of thai that i ' m used to , but it was quite good . the food was very flavorful and cooked perfectly and the wait staff was friendly and helpful . the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was perfect for a relaxed dinner out . the only reason i wouldn ' t give it N stars is that it seems kind of " safe " from a culinary standpoint and could have been more interesting . 
pizza joints are usually either italian owned and operated or run by people of mid-east origin . mix , i do believe , is of the latter variety . i can tell by the style of pizza . . . but this is not to say that one is better than the other - there are plenty of good , bad , or downright fantastic places on both ends of the pizza style-spectrum . that being said , mix delivers a really nice slice . i got a slice of veg . they didn ' t have a margherita available ( first clue that it ' s not owned by italians ) , so i got my no . N standard . it was on a super thin crust that was so covered with granulated garlic on the bottom that i nearly turned inside out with both glee and dread ( for anyone wh would have to talk to me in the next N hours ) . it was delicious , with balanced ratios of pizza elements that resulted in no additional spicing or cheesing needed . one star withheld for atmosphere i felt like i was sitting in a nightclub . it was dark and loud with top N dance . there should be neon signs flashing somewhere or a dj in a booth in the corner , or maybe just a reinactment of a scene from " a night at the roxy " . but i quietly ate my slice and ducked out , swirling in a garlicky haze . i will definitely chalk this up to one of my go-to pizza joints . . . so very welcome in a city that is sorely lacking in decent pies . italian or no , mix delivers . 
good squares there made up side down a real must go
ten years in philly and this past friday was my first time , ever , at john ' s . what is wrong with me ? ! the N of us waited over N minutes in line and snagged a table under the awning . we could barely contain our drool as we unwrapped our goodies N cheesesteak with onions and american cheese , N roast pork sandwich with mild provolone , N roast pork sandwich with spinach and sharp provolone , and fries . oozy goozy cheese on everything . my fave ! ! i ' ve sampled cheesesteaks far and wide , and john ' s is the best ever ! ! ! the spinach was an afterthought ( perhaps to be healthy ) , but it really detracted from the taste of the delicious pork . i ' m glad this place is only open until N and is far from my office , or else i ' d probably eat the cheesesteaks every week and give myself a heart attack . 
on my first trip to philly i was worried i ' d be hard pressed to find a decent vegan meal , boy was i wrong ! this place is amazing , awesome beer list , really friendly staff , and a great atmosphere ! i ' ve never had a " vegan bbq pulled pork " sandwich , but it was so amazing . it had that great vinegary bbq flavor you kinda want . , i had it with the fresh mashed and i was so pleased i went back the next day ! so good ! 
expensive , but it ' s the west village , so whaddya expect ? i love that it ' s like a stylish little cave , and i love that they usually have my favorite beer on tap , delirium tremens . sunday and monday nights are not quite as crazy packed as the rest of the week , and it ' s a little less suit-and-tie . i also really appreciate that they don ' t sell booze because i feel like bourbon and the very dark , very crowded , very tiny atmosphere would be a recipe for disaster
i came here when my friend came to town and i have to say yes i am a fan and so is she . real good food with real good service . that ' s all i need
good morning stop for a bagel sandwich . their bagels usually great . better prices than other shops around . the owners will get to know you quickly and always greet you , which is refreshing . 
i recently ate at pacifico for the first time last month with a friend and thought it was quite enjoyable ! by far some of the best mojitos in the area ! the lobster quesadillas were to die for and the guacamole was yummy ! the entrees were tasty and portioned appropriately so as not overstuffed . desert was to die for . . . definitely have to have desert here ! btw . . . the presentation of the dishes was exceptional ! chefs made potato and caramel nests . . . too cute ! waitor service was exceptional ! my water glass never reached empty , the waitress gave helpful advice , attention was paid to us throughout the meal , silverware was replaced after each course , the list goes on ! my only gripe is that it was slightly pricey ! i ' m not one to complain about prices or nor did i gag at the prices . . . but the portions could be slightly larger and i wouldn ' t mind the prices as much ! even my mojito had a bit much too ice for the price . . . lol ! 
this place was excellent ! our server thibaut was great , very attentive . the food was perfect , and they have by far , the best waffles i ' ve ever had in my life ! can ' t wait to go back when i take my next trip to ny . 
when i approach the counter , im not sure whats going on . whose in line , is it my turn , etc . then they only accept cash , okay its N not the Ns , if you wanna do cash only give us a free atm in the corner . when i walk up to the counter i expect to be greeted with a hello , do you need help . last but not least , you should put some ice in your smoothies . drinking warm smoothies in the summer time is whack . 
eataly is a wonderful italian gastronomic smorgasbord adventure . there ' s a great produce area ( black garlic , fiddlehead ferns , a dozen different types of unique mushrooms , fresh green almonds , salsify , etc . ) , fresh mozzarella station , salumi charcuterie area , fresh and live seafood section , a panini station , an area that makes fresh roast chicken , a gelateria , a coffeeshop , a bakery , a meat section , and several mini-restaurants ( or food courts , for lack of a better description ) that includes fresh pasta and oven baked pizza , seafood , veggies , and fine dining . oh and they also sell probably hundreds of types of imported cheeses , meats , pastas , olive oil , vinegar , pasta sauces , kitchen supplies , etc . can we say sensory overload ? i ' m feeling overwhelmed even typing it all out . let me address the two biggest complaints that i see from other reviewers it ' s crowded and expensive . crowded , yes . this is not your average market , this is a foodie destination backed by the celebrity chef mario batali , located right next to madison square gardens ( and right across the street from shake shack ) , in manhattan . come on people . it ' s N sq . ft . , filled to the brim with lots of wonderful , unique and delicious things . of course it ' s going to be crowded . i hate crowds but i knew it was to be expected there and i had no problem with it . as far as expensive ? i thought it was reasonably priced for new york . think about the overhead this place has too . the many employees , the sheer amount of things offered , the rent , geez even the electricity must be expensive . i didn ' t find it horribly pricey at all and ( but then again , i didn ' t buy a bunch of items ) . i really urge you to pop in and try to take everything in . peruse the aisles . look at the guy stretching out the fresh mozzarella , walk by the gilded wood fired pizza ovens , buy some gelato or coffee . you don ' t have to stay long but i think the experience is well worth it . batali really succeeded in bringing a little bit of italy to nyc . 
we came pretty late on sunday and we took a buffalo mozzarella pizza . it came surprisingly fast . it was relatively small ( N relatively small slices , would be ok for one person ) and cost N . it was not bad , but definitely far from what i ' ve expected . there was not much mozzarella on it and it didn ' t taste as amazing as i expected . the atmosphere was nice . service was nice , friendly and not pushy . 
one of the worst bars i ' ve ever entered . i ordered a dirty girl scout and the bartender gave me the wrong drink . he claimed i ordered the un-minty drink i had in my hand . later that night , i went to the bar across the street . i checked my bank statement and realized i was double charged--the bartender swiped my card twice for the same amount . i went back to the bar and confronted them . they brought out the manager and she insisted it was my bank ' s fault that the bill showed up on my statement twice but she also gave me forty dollars in cash while saying this nonsense . not to mention , i was waiting for the manager a few feet away from the kitchen door , and as a chef walked by , he snatched my phone out of my hand . i was totally not having it that night . i went up to him and he handed my phone back but when i asked him why he grabbed my phone out of my hand , he said he did not do such a thing . also , this chef claimed he was the manager and the owner of the bar . i didn ' t buy that bull crap because i talked to the manager prior to this new incident . also , they dramatically escorted me out of the bar because they didn ' t want other customers to know about the incidents above . and there was a lonely , old man ( customer ) who said something very nasty to me . overall , this place is horrendous . i would give this place N out of N stars if i could . 
i had read so many good comments about this place and i was so excited to try it , but the sandwich i got was terrible . my family and i decided to stop over ( july N , N around N-N pm ) from maine on our way home to maryland to try the " best sandwich in america . " so i ordered N of their special , " the roast pork with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone . " it was terrible and way overpriced . one of the sandwiches i had didn ' t even have any broccoli or provolone . the pork was dry and very hard to chew . the people working there weren ' t very friendly either . they acted like i was bothering them from texting talking . for N . N the sandwiches weren ' t worth it . i would have been better off elsewhere . 
peasant grill catered a party for us last weekend . the food was fabulous and we had many call from guests saying how original and tasty the food was . barry and michelle are wonderful to work with and we would certainly hope they will do another party for us . dede s . 
people here are N right about it being overpriced , but you are paying for the view . this place will blow up this summer with only a hand full of water view locations in the city it is on the cheap end . great place for big or small groups . big plus the corn hole game is free . so for a lazy day chill in the back and take in the sun . drinks are ok . and it is a seafood place so you are going to spend an extra buck or two . service was pretty good , 
yelp is great app ! 
alice ' s arbor fresh , wholesome tasty food ! visited twice and will be back for more . portion size is smaller than average but was sufficient to satisfy my appetite . great one-of-a-kind decor was a " vacation away from new york city " in itself -- you ' d quickly forget that you ' re in brooklyn once you step inside . a mini store where you can purchase some of the products that they use in their edible creations ! very friendly wait staff , great ambience , famiy-friendly , great variety of music . . . very reasonable prices ! highly recommended ! 
the interiorvof this restaurant needs a serious constructional makeover . the carpet is horrible and you might find yourself tripping over the bulges of old wrinkled carpet throughout the dining room . this is N ' s restaurant , but not cool enough for tony montana . 
if i could figure out how to give zero stars i would . slow , mediocre food , how does this place have N stars . wish we had tried the indian place down the street . 
i decided to go to korzo sunday night and i was having a great time watching the playoff games . i was talking to the bartender and who i think was the chef . we were having a great conversation . when who i think the owner was came down and told one of the employees not to curse because this was a public space . does he not know that in this country we have the right to free speech as it is our first amendment . my night was going great till that episode i will not be attending korzo ever again as it seems the person who said that to the employee obviously has no respect for the american way
by far the best pizza ever . the thin crust is perfect and try the meatballs . outstanding . 
went there several times and food was pretty good . however got a table near the kitchen entrance a couple of days ago and was able to see inside as waiters entered and exited . it was filthy and disgusting . restaurants in jersey should have to post their health ratings in the window like nyc . will never go there again ! 
we visited penelope based on its yelp reviews . we didn ' t have to wait long at all , maybe N minutes for the table to get cleaned up . we ordered pancakes and the pumpkin waffles , which were both delicious ! the pumpkin waffles were super moist and the pancakes were fluffy . the ambiance was my favorite thing about the entire experience . it has a very cozy feel to it--cute decor and lovely family feel . next time i ' m in nyc , i will definitely plan on stopping by penelope ' s for another great breakfast ! 
it is not enough to say that i absolutely adore pates et traditions . so much so that my boyfriend and i make it a point to come here for brunch lunch at least once a month . let ' s start with the wait staff . everyone is super friendly and very attentive to your needs . your water gets refilled right away and they always check in on you to make sure you ' re doing all right . everyone comes over with a smile on their face , which is always a plus ! the restaurant itself is quite small , but i ' ve found that i haven ' t had to wait for very long since everyone is so on top of things . in the summer , you are more likely to get a seat inside since people usually like to sit outside . it may prove to be a bit more difficult to find a seat during the winter , but i promise you it ' s worth the wait ( just get there earlier to beat the brunch rush if you can ) ! the decor is super cute and it just screams ' france ' . when you walk in , it doesn ' t feel like you ' re walking into a restaurant , but rather a super cozy home . love . it . and now the food . . oh god , the food ! i haven ' t tried anything else but the crepes , to be honest , but the crepes have made enough of an impression on me to keep coming back . my favorite is le poulet citron ( chicken , onions , lemon , rosemary , swiss , and honey ) . such an amazing blend of flavors ! in fact , all of the crepes i ' ve tried have been a really great blend of flavors . la savoyarde and la bergere are also very , very good . my boyfriend ' s favorite is la sultan ( chicken , bacon , cumin , swiss , cream , garlic , onions , and mint ) -- i promised myself that i would get this the next time we went since i had a small bite of his and it was also quite yummy ! i ' d recommend washing your crepes down with their french lemonade sodas . the blood orange one is my favorite , but they ' re all great . they also make really good cappuccinos ! if a savory crepe isn ' t enough for you , worry not -- they have dessert crepes too ! i ' ve only had the la banane nutella and la banane chocolat and yes , they are both amazing . their homemade chocolate is so rich and it really reminds me of the chocolate i used to eat in france as a kid . with all of this food , you would think that one would leave the restaurant super bloated . . . but i ' ve always left very content . it ' s like their portions are perfectly sized to make you full , but not to the point where you feel sick . if you ' re still debating whether or not to try pates et traditions , debate no more ! this place is the absolute best ! 
i went to sally ' s last week for the first time in a few years with some childhood friends of mine from new haven . i was wondering how good the pies would be . after one bite , i knew . heaven , nirvana , ecstasy . ultra-thin but chewy crust , with delicious sauce and toppings . the aura of the great sal consiglio stil hangs in this place . my only regret was that flo wasn ' t there that night so i could give her a hug . my brother will be visiting from georgia in a week and we will go there to eat and buy a few larges to bring back to my mother ' s house to freeze and enjoy during the rest of his stay . 
the food was great , but don ' t go on a cold day ! we came here for brunch after reading all of the great reviews . we waiting for N minutes to get a table and were eventually seated . the menu was standard sophisticated brunch fare . i had an apple onion frittata which was a solid b . the service was okay . it took about N minutes for us to get our food ( it was busy ) , but the waiter never came over to us during that time to ask if we needed more drinks or to apologize for the wait . also , it was freeeezing ! i thought maybe it was because we were seated near the door that is was so cold , but a walk to the back of the restaurant ( where there is even a wood stove ) , proved to be no warmer . my boyfriend nor i could feel our toes after N minutes in this place . it was a N degree day , so i can ' t even imagine how cold it would be on a real wintery N degree day . would i go back ? maybe . and only during a warmer month . 
one of the best places to get italian cuisine in nyc ! when i went , they were offering a promotion to try three different types of pasta and the one you liked best was all you can eat . this also included a salad and bread . all three choices were fantastic ! even their plain spaghetti was great ! what is also great is that though the food is amazing , they ' re relatively reasonable on price ! i will definitely go back ! ! ! 
my husband and i were intrigued by a newspaper review of the kitchen table and decided to try it for dinner . we were attracted by the commitment to using sustainable local food . we had an early reservation on a thursday and the restaurant was empty . my husband ordered the fish and chips ( fish with tiny potatoes ) which he liked but he was disappointed with the aioli which tasted like mayo . i had the bell pepper stuffed with barley . the red pepper was huge but there was not enough stuffing for the pepper size and the barley was very bland . the salt i added gave it some flavor . we shared the flourless chocolate cake for dessert . it was rich with a good chocolate taste but kind of dry and crumbly . we like the decor , service and use of locally sourced foods , but the food needs some attention in order to make this restaurant a destination . they have a lot of competition in new haven . 
came here for the first time on a tuesday evening after work with the boyfriend . this place is definitely easy to miss since it ' s small and not at the best location . this interior of this place kind of reminds me of five guys . . must be the red and white colored walls minus the peanuts they have at five guys and then add in some photos of random celebrities on the wall and voil ! you have N burgers . there are many options to pick from ( N burgers , duh lol ) but i decided to go with the burger of the month which happened to be the meat lover burger ( bacon , ham , pepperoni , provolone cheese , and marinara sauce - all for N ! ) . my burger was super juicy and delicious . they definitely did not skimp out on the amount of meat for this burger ( which my boyfriend was really happy about ) . i did have to wait in line for a while and had to wait some more after i placed my order for my burger but it was worth it ! we also ordered the seasoned chili cheese fries which was delicious as well but i didn ' t feel like the fries were that seasoned . but that ' s okay because it was drenched in cheese sauce and chili . expect to have food coma after eating here because the portions are huge ! i definitely had to take a walk afterwards and i even gave some of my burger to my boyfriend . maybe next time i ' ll order a burger without so much meat so i can actually finish it lol . i will definitely be coming back here ! 
the food was very good . the service was excellent . not a dessert person but the desserts were memorable . get some tapas and relax . f
i work in the market east section of the city , so when a " mexican " craving comes-on , i either end up here or the Nth street cantina in the reading terminal . similar to qdoba , they give you the assembly line overstuffed burrito . basically a premature food baby wrapped in a tortilla . i go for the grilled veggie burrito . the burrito comes with grilled peppers and onions , cheese , lettuce , rice , choice of pinto and black beans , choice of salsa , sour cream , and guacamole . feel free to customize as you wish . their ingredients look and taste fresh and fill you up for the rest of the day . it ' s nice to have this place in such a convenient location . when the weather permits - take it over to washington square park for some people watching . 
great pork tacos and beer selection
let me start with saying that the food was excellent . we came , N of us , for sunday brunch . i had the poached lobster with potato ravioli . the lobster was soft and sweet and just perfect . actually , every thing that i tasted from my friends ( and i tastes a few things ) was just delicious . my only complaint is with the service . our waitress was terrible , she seamed inexperienced and unhappy . she didn ' t smile once and i really wouldn ' t care about that , if she only did her job well . it took forever for the food to arrive . we had to call her over to take our drink orders and then our dessert order . the coffee arrived cold and when asked to replace it she said " of course " and never came back . we had to ask one of the bus boys . maybe it had something to do with the fact that they automatically charged a N tip to the bill so she really had no reason to work to hard . a restaurant of that caliber should really have better service . 
i got the ultimate club wrap , which boasted roasted turkey , bacon , pesto mayo , lettuce and tomato . figured it was a pretty safe bet . instead , it was possibly the worst sandwich i ' ve ever had . the " turkey " was a handful of gelatinous cubes that had the consistency of rubber cement . the " bacon " was a processed monstrosity that was all gristle and possessed the stretchy properties of taffy . as for the pesto mayo , it was probably all right , but considering it was all concentrated in the first bite , leaving the rest of the wrap naked , it ' s hard to say . even though i was starving , i couldn ' t finish it . had to grab some yogurt just to keep from consuming office supplies . i hear the soup is good . maybe that ' s because they don ' t make it . 
awesome breakfast . the red velvet pancakes are killer ! ! ! ! great staff too . 
i recently discovered this place and i am so happy i did . the food is great , the menu has a wide selection , and the staff is extremely friendly- i will definitely be coming here often
N stars times a billion more ! d e l i c i o u s expensive but worth it ! the bread basket is a must and the puppy scramble N eggs are N because there is nothing better ! yum yum yum
i really loved this place and am dreaming of the antipasti ! i will definitely return on my next trip to philly . i went on a saturday night , around N , with the husband and we didn ' t have to wait for a table . i didn ' t find it too loud at all inside . i don ' t think it ' s great for a group larger than N due to the size of the space and tables . besides the antipasti , we had the grilled shrimp and ribeye steak , both were yummy . i ended with the chocolate pecan tart- it was tasty too . the coffee , while a little expensive- was excellent too ! i guess the coffee is high priced since it ' s a byob . . . service was wonderful- worth a trip ! 
atmosphere was pretty nice . service was ok . food was sub par . two things that stuck out the most were the beer glasses were not cold and one of the sushi ' s i ordered was still a bit frozen on the bottom . spicy toro ? why ? 
the spotted pig has lived up to it ' s name as quite the " spot " for the past several years filling up with crowds of N-somethings every thursday thru saturday night well before most folks have even left their offices , homes , and or mid-afternoon matinee . i ' ve gotta tell you , while the burgers and gnudi ( pronounced nude-ee and therefore often referred to as naked gnocchi ) are melt-in-your-mouth delicious , the long waits and ( hopefully ) unintentional elbowing at the bar can be a bit vexing . the next time i head to spotted pig will be on a day i ' ve opted to play hookie from work . while i love the bustling crowds when i ' m on the prowl , the long waits for a table can be a real turn-off . it ' s a good thing the food is tasty enough to merit taking a special work " holiday " -- this may just be the only way you ' ll get to sit down , relax , and enjoy it ! 
our first time giving them a try is our last time . the guy taking orders is too busy chatting with the guy behind the register to actually listen to what you order . after N mistakes we finally got our correct order . the pizza was just ok but the calzone was awful . the dough was still totally raw on the inside . i bit into it and could only taste raw dough . i took it back for a refund and did not receive an apology . just " ok that is N . N here i ' ll give you N . N " and that was that . when i said " seriously ? not even an apology ? you served me an uncooked item ! " he sarcastically said " oh ok ma ' am i ' m sorry " . we will not go back . horrible food and horrible service . don ' t waste your time . there are plenty of better pizza options in the area . 
lovely restaurant , excellent service . the food is superb . we went for dinner and shared everything- crab toast ( fresh and delicate ) , roasted squash ( perfect fall food ) , roasted carrots and avocado salad ( best carrots i ' ve ever had ) , and mushroom egg pizza ( perfect combination of woodsy mushrooms , creamy cheese , and runny egg ) . we also had the fig cobbler ( apple sorbet was the bomb ) and a scoop of the cinnamon ice cream . their housemade sodas were delicious too- i had a lime basil one that i ' m still thinking about . this is a definite repeat restaurant- it ' s better with a big party so you can try more dishes ! 
their rose macaroon is a must try . it ' s like having an explosion of rose petals on your palate . the green apple is very refreshing . i ' ve been to this location twice and there has always been a line up , but it is totally worth the wait . i also picked up two macaroon key chains for my girl friends . looks really cute with small purses . 
food was only ok . definitely over priced for what you get . it ' s not cute for dinner . definitely not a place for a nice dinner . too loud . the lighting is awful . staff tried hard but kept spilling stuff all over the table . i felt bad because i brought my out of town friend here . not a great representation of new york dining ( 
the best place in the whole wide world . i live in fidi and once we discovered chopping block we never go anywhere else . real ingredients , real food . just go order i promise you won ' t be disappointed . ask about the soups ! 
i want to like buffalo wings , i really do . they ' re such a big group bonding food , super cheap , and come in different flavours . i love flavours . but try as i might , i just can ' t get into them . but no matter , because archie moore ' s has so much to offer , in addition to their famously delicous wings ( that i ' ve never tried ) . it ' s bar food , but it ' s good bar food , and even better - it ' s decently priced , good bar food . they have super duper friggin fantastic fries - cripsy , batter-y on the outside , smooth and chewy on the inside , and just the right amount of over-saltiness ( but in the best of ways for fries ! ) . and nachos . my goodness , do i love nachos . the regular are super huge and topped with plenty of cheese , jalapenos , and sides of salsa and sour cream . mmmmmmmmmm . they also have a wide selection of delicious-sounding sandwiches and wraps . my favourite so far is the paul ' s grilled chicken - chicken with american cheese ( i sub in swiss ) , hot and sweet peppers . mmmm . add to that a pint of beer on tap , and you ' re set . not only is the food good , but it ' s a great atmosphere . it has this very comfy , cozy neighbourhood , chill feel to it . i love it . i should have started coming here earlier . why did i wait so long ? ? ? update ( it ' s useful , i promise ) their happy hour ( monday - friday , N - N pm ) can no longer provide free wings , but instead offers half-price wings and N off draft beers . hey , they ' ve been shelling out free wings for so long ( actually , i don ' t really know for how long , but i ' m just guessin . . . ) , i ' m sure we can accommodate . and on a personal note . . . my new favourite item also requires updating . it is now the vegetable club sandwich . i know , what moron goes to a bar and orders the friggin veggie option . um . . right here , i would be that moron . but it ' s surprisingly good for a veggie sandwich , a veggie sandwich at a bar , no less . it has lots of fresh ingredients and a tasty ( way better than boca ! ) veggie patty-like thing . throw in the fries , and i could eat that same thing for daaaaaaaaaaaaays , if not weeks . 
slightly disappointed that they stopped serving breakfast . . because i really love breakfast food . . . but i have to tell you this - get the apple dumpling with whip cream - the portion is decent , but the taste is awesome . no wonder yelpers are raving about it . oh yeah . . . the market gets a bit crowded though . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
it ' s easy to miss this new restaurant located in a busy street where there are several other indian restaurants . i live in the area and consider myself very picky when it comes to indian food . the quality of the food served in some of the other indian restaurants in the area is average at best . talk of the town excels in everything they serve . food is tasty , authentic and rightly spiced with an emphasis on cleanliness . tried their parathas , kati rolls , chana batura and the thalis over a period of last three months . was never disappointed . highly recommended if you are looking for real indian food . i am sure you will be a repeat customer . 
our first time here just ordered the virgin margerita . sour ! decor is very nice and festive . husband had chicken enchiladas and i had mancho nachos . his choice was basic or soso sauce tasted like chef boy r d ' s sauce but clean in taste and texture . my dish was delish with every vote . must try ! 
i ' ve been wanting to try this place for quite a while , so what better time than during restaurant week ? for all of the reviews that i read about this place , i had been looking forward to it , so it was quite the disappointment when we went and experienced nothing but mediocrity . many others have commented about the decor--the decor was terribly dated and really not asian or inviting at all . the thing that was the most off-putting was the fabric faces on each chair and the lights that faded in and out . the buddha was kind of strange too , as the body seemed to stem from greek influence and the head ( which was disproportionately small ) from more of a cantonese take on what a buddha should be . the waiter was so blah and condescending the whole evening . when he asked us if we ' d be using the restaurant week menu it was said as if we were going to that we were the lowly of the low for doing so . totally lackluster service . the food my friend ordered the hamachi appetizer , which was good , but not memorable . i had the chicken dumplings , the meat inside which was indistinguishable and they reminded me of something that you could get at a chinese takeout place for N . N . next , my friend had the the cashew chicken and i had the short rib chow fun . i tried his entree , and it was bland and flavorless , the only good part were the peas . the short rib dish was fairly decent , a small proportion of actual meat , which i have to say i was expecting . the noodles were pretty good . for dessert i had the coconut pana cotta , which was served at room temperature . there was no actual coconut flavor , but it was ok for a gelatin based dessert . the worst part about it was that it was served on a piece of slate . the last thing i want to do is scrape my fork across a piece of slate to eat my dessert . my friend had the crying chocolate , which was an average chocolate lava cake similar to something served at a chili ' s . my white peach cosmopolitan tasted like white grape juice and not of liquor at all . for having been so excited to go here , i could not have been more disappointed , and i was a bit embarrassed that i suggested it as neither my friend or i had a good time . i can ' t recommend this place with all of the other much better places in philly , and i won ' t be returning . 
absolutely love this place ! been coming for about N years now and it gets no better than star tavern ! pizza , salad , and buffalo wings are my fav
i just was there last week . we had some sushi and sushi appetizers , the food was delish . one of the nicest restaurants i ' ve been to . definitely and experience to remember . must try ! 
i ' m playing catch-up with my yelp reviews from last week ' s uye because central jersey does eat breakfast for dinner . first off , i want to thank amalia y for putting this event together . it was awesome to get together with such a diverse , resourceful and fun group of yelpers . oh yea , i almost forgot -- amalia is pronounced " emily . " after reviewing the menu , it was obvious that it wasn ' t just about pancakes . they also had burgers , a selection of italian foods , sandwiches , panini and gourmet salads as well . our group , however , was there for breakfast at dinner time . being a creature of habit , my breakfast selection was pretty straight forward . i ordered the pj ' s two-fer breakfast , which consisted of N scrambled eggs , N pancakes , N slices of bacon , N ( can ' t figure that one out ) link of sausage and a add-on of white toast . arlene ordered the eggs benedict , which also came with a side of mashed browns . when her plate was delivered , the yolk was as solid as the yolk in a hard-boiled egg . i convinced her to send it back . needless to say , arlene had to sit there without food as we all started to eat . it would have been a bit more professional to let her begin to eat the other items on the plate while they re-did her egg . the hit of the meal seemed to be the pancake sampler . unless i ' m mistaken , bill m liked the chocolate chip best of all . with so many dining choices in princeton , i ' ll likely choose another restaurant during my next visit . 
who would have thought that putting artichoke on a pizza would taste like a drop of heaven on earth . this is hands down the best pizza in nyc
great local business ! i ' m traveling for work this week and stopped in for a quick solo lunch . i ordered a half bbq cubano sandwich and a cup of crab corn chowder . both were delightful ! the service was prompt and friendly . i came a bit after the lunch rush ( around N N ) and there were several tables available . definitely recommend ! 
fries . fries . fries . more fries ! very limited seating , so don ' t expect to sit and eat there because the seats fill up fast . there was a line , but it moved quickly . there was quite a lot of different sauce choices , so there is something for every taste bud . sauce wasn ' t bad . fries were good and crispy . 
i ' ve been to the spectacular ippudo N or N times . fantastic ramen - every time . but totto is unique in that it is so tiny . of course , with the size comes the long wait . the best bet is to arrive for lunch at N , put your name on the list and return at N N . they call names off the list and as long as you ' re there at noon , you ' re in . so , so good that it ' s hard to suggest one ramen vs . another . but the sea urchin on rice was delicious as was the tuna appetizer . you just can ' t go wrong here . 
-overall good experience for the first time . -great environment , but family style seating , so it can get pretty tight . -spicy pork with mushroom sauce and provolone is as good as crack . -waitress got order wrong even with the dry erase laminated menu ordering system . ( but crack rock meatballs made up for it ) -beer selection was scarce , but no biggie . -hostess was cute and welcoming . -i would definitely come back again . 
definitely one of the best for roast pork and cheesesteaks . sure , you need to try dinic ' s and i guess geno ' s and pat ' s at least once , but once that ' s done , forget the insane lines at those other places and come here for a much more manageable wait and some of the best sandwiches you could hope for . ask for spinach and sharp provolone on a roast pork sandwich ( N . N for a small , which is big enough ) , and you will get one of the most delicious sandwiches ever . in addition to the namesake , don ' t forget to get a cheesesteak too , for one of the best i ' ve ever had . i like it simple with fried onions and american ( i don ' t think they even offer whiz here ) . my one beef here is the ordering system which i now understand to improve my experience next time . you order stuff from the grill ( i . e . cheesesteaks ) separately from the " pork , beef or meatball " line . when it ' s busy , it can take up to N minutes or so for the cheesesteaks , while the roast pork sandwiches are ready immediately . you have to wait around inside the tiny store though to hear them shout out your name and then chaotically try to pass it along from one end of the counter to the other to get it to you . i would suggest wolfing down a roast pork sandwich immediately ( at the tables outside if it ' s nice enough , or in your car ) and then going back in to pick up your cheesesteak . this is a much more pleasant experience than the more tourist-heavy options with insane wait times and crowded eating areas . it ' s fun to watch the banter between the cooks and the locals that have been coming here for years . you must come here to try some of the best sandwiches philly has to offer . 
is there any way to give N star ? ? ? outrageous is my first and only impression to the way how this seemingly popular restaurant treated its customers . from the right beginning when we walked into this restaurant , the atmosphere didn ' t feel right . we were seen as ' invisible ' by the staff there even though several tables were already cleaned up and ready to serve . the waitress skipped us anyway , and started serving the person who arrived after us . hey , come on , are you blind ? ? ? we had to ask for being seated . however , you know what , we were even not allowed to choose where to seat . funny , right ? ! during the entire stay , we were treated as ' invisible ' . no staff served us water , or , even made an apology for not being attentative . we were just treated like third-class citizens . finally , we raised our voice to get the attention from everyone who was dining there . this time the staff there was no longer deaf and blind . but again , they just don ' t care about customers . their attitude just really made people sick and pissed off ! we didn ' t dine there at all , and left with disappointment ! ! ! so , we cannot speak for the food quality there . but , if you want to have ' invisible ' experience , we will definitely recommend this restaurant ! ! ! 
dinner was amazing the service was ok but the food was so good it made up for it goat cheese balls and the shrimp and chorizo skewers highly recommended . 
this place is ok . they have a nice bar out back . their guacamole is awesome . their tacos . . . however might not be enough , depending your stomach . 
great bar ! good atmosphere and ambiance which is hard to find along Nth avenue . have been here many times . owner genuinely cares about customers . recommended ! ! 
big disappointment , bad food and they acknowledged they knew it ! . . . ummm . . . hello ? ? came there with my girlfriend for dinner . at first , we noticed the staff was quite friendly , and our waitress was very nice . i ordered tuna and my girlfriend ordered lasagna . my tuna was barely ok , but my girlfriend ended up sending her lasagna back after N bites - it was baaaad ! they apologized to her and said that " this is not the first complaint we ' ve had about the lasagna . . . " they tried offering us other dishes but we both weren ' t very hungry anymore . a few minutes later , without asking , they brought us N ( unsuitably oversized ) forks and tried to pitch dessert . " no thanks " . in the end , another guy came out and apologized again , and again said they knew about the problem before . . . the whole experience was quite funny , but if it weren ' t for the friendly waitress , we would have both walked out on the spot . if you know you have a problem with some specific dish , do not try to feed it to other customers . you can not afford to be so unprofessional in such a competitive environment . it appears that this restaurant needs a quick reorganization and a management change - clearly something is severely broken here . eat there at your own risk ! 
good street food . not surprised why it has long line whenever walk by lunch time ) 
i ' m an avid lover of cuban food , and my favorite morristown restaurant closed . my boyfriend convinced me to try cuban pete ' s and it was possibly some of the greatest food i ' ve ever had in my life . minus the thiry minute wait in the cold , ( the staging area was so packed , it was easier to wait outside ) i had the best night . our waiter was incredibly knowledgable , a student from msu . he directed me toward all the entrees that were gluten free and we tried three tapas dishes to start with our house made sangria . the bacon wrapped figs were insane . i wanted to order ten more to go . i had the porkchops with the most decadent plantains on the side , and my boyfriend had the ribs with a housemade mango bbq sauce . i ' m waiting for the next birthday in my group of friends to celebrate at cuban pete ' s . great restaurant , great atmosphere . definitely one of the best restaurants in jersey . 
tasty food friendly staff . decent prices an upbeat atmosphere . downstairs has a neat , old keg cellar decor . also , nice variety of draught beer . 
the bartender with the beard and the dark hair is one of the rudest bartenders i have ever encountered ! he always has an attitude , makes pissy comments to customers and put my food and drinks on my sister ' s tab because we had the same last name " and he couldn ' t tell which one was which in the system ! " so you ' re telling me if two people with the same last name come into this establishment and start a tab you have absolutely no way of distinguishing them nj the computer system ? complete bs . i ' m sure people complain about him , and yet he keeps his job . perhaps he ' s better suited for another position in the restaurant ? all bar owners must be aware that the bartenders can make or break their business . this bartender is hurting this business . otherwise , the food is amazing ! they need a better selection of beer but i can deal with it . good addition to the city . 
our party of N arrived at bouley for a late dinner - starting at Npm . to be sure , we were all hungry by then , so it was good that service was relatively fast , unlike many of bouley ' s counterparts . our table took on the N-course tasting challenge , of course ! since the menu is not available online , and i was quite tired by then , i ' ll use this review to give a general gist of what ' s to come if you go there since i can ' t remember the names of everything i got . i walked into bouley thinking that i would not be impressed as i ' m not typically a fan of french dinner food , but was i wrong . from the appetizer to the dessert , everything came out fresh , hot , and tasty . as with most french food , it was rich - but since portion sizes are not controlled by mcdonald ' s - everything came out in just the right amounts . one item that i do remember was the valrhona chocolate souffle - every bite was as bittersweet and rich as the last - and it was by far one of my favorite desserts i ' ve had in a while . to complement the dishes , bouley also has a great selection of artisan breads - from apricots , walnuts , pistachios , to plain old sourdough . i ' d recommend the apricots and pistachios - two of my faves . we would have tried the cheese selection had it not been Nam by the time we finished with dessert ! 
the staff at the restaurant is very cordial . . . i ordered the steak fajita while waiting for my food , i decided to have the nachos salsa . . . i was disappointed with the salsa having a lack of flavor it was watery . . . the sizzling steak fajita arrived i immediately noticed i had more green pepper ( strips ) than steak ( strips ) , i was able to consumed N tacos with various toppings , e . g . , refried beans , rice , onions , guacamole . . . the tacos were tasty , but overall , it was an underwhelming experience . . . my queen had the mexican lettuce wrap which includes pork pineapple . . . she extremely happy with her meal . . . 
we went for sugo sunday for my birthday . start to finish it was superb - the bread is flavorful , perfectly crusty and addictive . we started off with the antipasto appetizer , then came the meatballs - best in the city - and sausage - four servings of pasta - bucatini , rigatoni , gnocchi , and lasagna . all , well done - perfectly cooked . then - oh my - terrific meats - pork and chicken thighs done in a rosemary thyme lemon sauce , arugula salad to finish ( we always do salad at the end in my italian family ) - and a desert sampler . . . . for N . . . really ? service was spot on . . . all good - we will be back ! 
we went after reading yelp ' s reviews . it was disappointing . the only good things about this place is the location and the hours . i wasn ' t impressed with the cheesecake one bit . will not be going back unless i have a craving at Nam in the morning and they are the only option , 
the food in this place is amazing . the prices are reasonable , the portions very generous and most importantly , the food tastes great . i ' m very familiar with what thai dishes should taste like , and this is comparable to food you ' d get in thailand . i would recommend any of the shrimp dish entrees as well as the pad thai , and any of the fried rice options . regarding the service , i ' ve seen the reviews about the bad service , but that ' s not at all what i ' ve experienced . have been here twice and each time had very nice waitresses . even the hostess was not bothered when we wanted to move inside after having a table in their lovely outside garden area . this is my family ' s new favorite thai restaurant . 
this is my first time at this buffet and it will def be my last . . . . . i went to get some fried rice and found a piece of brillo pad in it , i go to let one of the employees know and she pic up the piece with a spoon and kept serving it . . but for the foremost the service is horrible , they are rude . . . i felt like i was in the movie south central and were eyeing me like hurry up and buy . . but seriously it was horrible . . . i dont recommend to anyone ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
affordable , amazingly good , and easy to purchase . these are one of my favorite sweets which is only made better by the fact that everyone here is super friendly . everything is vegan , but you ' d never know it and all of my friends who eat marshmallows with gelatin have agreed that these are better . if you haven ' t tried them yet , you need to . 
i love this place . its always a cool scene , food is great , awesome wine list . i go here late night and i am never dissapointed . 
odd that mario batali is a partner of this spanish establishment . the tables are small , interior is dimly lit , and there ' s a bar with court-side views of the chefs in action . okay fine , the small plates can be traced back to otto ' s antipasti selection , but similarities disperse from there . the charcuterie and terrine board is a must get . pates , head cheese , mustard and pickles -- easily some of my favorites foods on one plate . the foie gras , rich and caramelized as it should be . oh and the fideos with clams ! a touch on a salty side , but ever so perfectly executed . all too often at small restaurants that serve sweetbreads , the membrane isn ' t completely removed resulting in unpleasant flavors and textures . not here , sweetbreads were perfectly cleaned and had a great char on them . it ' s a tight fit and reservations are somewhat difficult , but plan your visit in advance and you ' ll surprisingly be rewarded . 
this should probably be the only review with less than five stars . . . why you may ask ? while the party bomb is awesome , their sushi both amazing and affordable , and they have N different levels of wasabi pain in their soy sauce . . . why charge N . N for pickup momo ? i came out in the freezing cold to get you . . . 
this place is a train wreck . the front of the house has absolutely no clue . we decided to stay for the food and were pleasantly surprised . at least the kitchen can cook ! get it together guys . it ' s not even busy . . . . . . 
i ' m absolutely speechless . this place gets N stars for being swanky , freshly caught seafood , affordable , and just plain delicious . the clam chowder was perfectly proportional with the right amount of potatoes to clams to creamy soup . if i shall ever return to west haven , i will make it a priority to stop there ! 
two words happy hour . come here and get down and dirty with this amazing happy hour ! i had not come to an on the border since college and well , it hasn ' t changed much , thankfully either have the prices . although the ambiance is not necessarily of the best type of happy hour , there are families having dinner with their kids and there ' s someone in the back making fresh tortillas , the food is actually really good . we came and indulged in some coronitas ( margarita with a corona in it ) for only N ! appetizers like the chicken chimichanga and guacamole are not to be missed , but skip the flautas ( heart attack-ville with all that oil ) . if you come on a wed , they have the fajitas on a sizzling skillet for N , which is a steal ! as stated by other yelpers try not to fill up on the overwhelming mountain of hot tortilla chips on the table , but by the end of your first coronita you wlll probably forget that tip . this is an excellent place to come with a few coworkers , friends or even a casual date . i will definitely be heading this way again really soon . 
that cheesy chili corn ! that cuban ! those margs ! consistently mouthwatering . always a wait but worth it . a soho staple . and thank god for habana to go ! 
came here on a double date with my foodie idol who turned me onto scoutmob - so naturally we used the N deal here . it ' s a tiny , cozy , east village place that serves delicious comfort food and beer wine . the waitress said we ordered the last fried chicken of the night there so that was lucky - and all the other soul food was delicious and sinful as it should be . the price got up there with alcohol but would definitely go back . N N N
best taste with the bucks ! ! the fried cheese appetizer with the cilantro mayo sauce is a must have ! ! love the mami , arepa pabellon , reina , and bomba arepas ! ! great location . . relax atmosphere , friendly service , and awesome musiiiic ! ! definitely worth coming ! ! 
went back to green eggs today . first time in a few months . a few things have changed while popular before , green eggs seems to have become the honey ' s of south philly . this place if filled to the brim with hip folks getting brunch the morning after . the wait ranged from a long time to a very , very long time . i wonder if the morning glory has tumbleweeds blowing around . wow . and secondly , they changed the signature grilled cheese ! why oh why ? ! the unique pesto rosemary on baguette is gone , replaced by a gouda filled , chewy contraption served on plain ol white bread . it has a split long hot on it with bacon . ( by the way , vegetarians take note the bacon is curiously not listed in the menu ' s description ) . i find it somewhat inspired , and certainly tasty , but it just does not stand up to the previous dish . as i told my fiance , the grilled cheese sort of reminded me of the one i ordered as a tot at friendly ' s . i meant it as a nostalgic compliment , but in hindsight , it ' s kinda sad . still an alright place . certainly an interesting , exotic brunch menu . bring back the pesto grilled cheese ! ! ! 
this place is filthy and has a bug problem . 
ok , neither i nor any of my companions had pancakes - i don ' t care if they ' re supposedly served all day , i don ' t want pancakes for dinner in a bistro - so maybe i really did miss the best thing about this place . unfortunately , i ' m not particularly enthusiastic to go back and try again . our server , though sweet , was disorganized we had to ask for several items - like water and pepper - more than once . right off the bat , there are enough annoying aspects about this restaurant that i have no real urge to go back . first , as i ' ve said elsewhere , i realize that restaurants want to sell you beverages , but please , if i ask for a glass of water , do not serve me a tiny six-ounce glass of room temperature tapwater . please . a larger glass and some ice should be standard . ( and by the way , we all did order other beverages i had both wine and a diet soda . ) second , as above , get your act together and get your service up to par . third , i really like to see what i ' m eating this place was so dark , i really could not see my steak . really . as for the food as an appetizer , i had the chickpea salad , which was delicious and served in a very large portion ( too large for an appetizer , but i guess that ' s good value so ok ) . the bread served for the table was unremarkable , and the butter was served in a very cold , hard-to-spread cube ( another pet peeve set it at room temperature so your customers can actually spread the stuff ) . my main course was disappointing , though . i ordered the hanger steak with what was described as a caramelized onion sauce . the steak was a tiny bit underdone - i think so , anyway , as i could not really see it - and was rather too chewy , but the sauce was truly horrible , tasting nothing at all like caramelized onion but rather like a pool of salt water . really , really over-salted ugh . my wife was none too impressed with her pork chops she said they were just ok , nothing special , and rather dry . i don ' t have any reason to go back , particularly since i myself make some pretty damn good scratch pancakes . 
great food , fantastic service . we had a party of N for v day and as crowded as they were , still had a great wait staff and amazing food . going in expecting small plates tapas style , but moderate prices . we had N plates for N and had a very satisfying meal . thanks to eric for giving up his v day to hang out with us , he felt more like another friend at the table than a waiter . 
i wanted to go to this restaurant last year for my birthday but couldn ' t wait the hour during the brunch to dinner switch so i decided to try again for brunch over the weekend . i ' m happy i didn ' t end up there on my birthday because my group was way too big and the space , which is pretty small . the brunch menu was good , offering a variety of dishes . the waitress seemed pretty knowledgeable with her recommendations as that was my first time there . i can ' t say i would return for brunch , not because my food was bad , but i wasn ' t impressed . i may return for dinner , but it wouldn ' t be my first choice . 
fabulous food . . . amazing to eat here . 
both spots are great i believe there ' s one in park slope and one in bay ridge . both places make great brick oven pizza . def got my stamp of approval N star ! all day every day . margherita pizza is really good at peppinos you will savor every bite . they even deliver pretty far . so if your in the ft greene area and your in the mood for some pizza give these guys a call . 
although their beer prices recently went up ( in the last year ) , i ' m still a big fan . N N price beers on mondays made them a staple for me last summer when i had the time off ( and wasn ' t on a diet ) . delicious food , though the mussels are a bit soupy and take some getting used to . awesome fries . great atmosphere . just love this place . . . always a stand by for great belgian brews . they do need to get rid of the live music , which is often tiresome . excellent bathrooms , a big plus for me as a neat freak . do not confuse this place with the horror show in tribeca . 
my fiance and i went for brunch , but sadly we had to send both plates back . . . the manager was understanding and didn ' t charge , which was really cool of him . our server , though , didn ' t want to be at work that day . after a chilly welcome , we asked about a dish . " don ' t know . . never tried it " . . . . okayyy . . . . . then i asked about another dish . " don ' t know . never tried it . " 
food was delicious and service was great . good atmosphere for a quick bite alone or to catch up with friends . 
i haven ' t been to eat gaia ' s food in a while but i was feining for it today - so i took a taxi and had an arugula salad to my delight ! better than i remember . . . everything about this place is authentic and the owner insists on keeping it that way . . . simply the best ! 
the food and service are amazing at rp ! ! ! ! ! ! the hot tea is very tasty , and goes good with the meal . you have to try the general tso chicken , it is delicious ! ! ! also i experienced a aloe martini , and it was definitely worth the try ! ! ! ! 
greatest food value in new york , maybe the world , N tasty pork dumplings for just a buck ( N . N ) ? you can ' t beat it ! for N bucks you can have a whole meal . i love it . and don ' t forget i was the first writer , blogger , whatever to discover this place . it took other N year and a half to catch up , just like noodle town which i discover N years before " mario batali " ever knew what new york was . 
we frequent many restaurants in philly , nyc and anywhere we travel . we ' ll do everything from upscale joints to greasy spoons ( if recommended to us . ) my N mexican beyond compare has been rosa mexicano in nyc but i think i ' ve found one here in philly in the same league . xochitl was one we rolled the dice on and that roll came up " N . " my better half loved the guacamole and i thought the mole chicken drumettes were fantastic . the highlight for me was the " takes three days to prepare " pollo fito . it had to be one of the tastiest , succulent , good to the bone chicken dishes i ' ve ever had . this was not what i expected when i entered ( and i mean that in the best possible way . ) we will definitely be back to enjoy " so-cheet " again ! 
we ate here the other night for the first time . we ordered tons of food for the table and everything was absolutely delicious . there was not one misstep in the entire meal and we seriously ordered tons of items . the service was lovely as well . i cannot wait to go back . 
since i am new to the area i need to find more of this kind of places to eat and to hang out with friend . i love kona grill in general so i was happy to see it in hackettstown . 
the empamadas weren ' t exactly unforgettable . what i appreciate most about empamada mama is the actual restaurant itself . you don ' t feel like you ' re eating at N-dollar-sign restaurant . it ' s dimly lit with a very chic and swanky feel . of course , you end up sitting closely to those around you , but come on . . this is new york , when will you ever get a lot of space ? anyway , sometimes i just wanna go someplace for dinner and sit comfortably and eat with a friend , and unfortunately many places in new york are so incredibly small that you really have to just stand outside and drip food onto yourself . i ' m glad empamada mama is an exception ) 
whoever says you aren ' t getting full or your money ' s worth at traif is a straight pig . almost the entire menu is under N dollars . i ' ve gone maybe N times and i always end up over-ordering because they all have new stuff and it ' s always so great . and there are only about N out of the N dishes listed that are over N bucks . with a bottle of wine , whomever i ' m with and i are stuffed for around N- N - and that ' s after taking an incredible food journey each time . the place has something for everyone , and somehow manages to mix the fancy stuff , like yellow-tail carpaccio or whatever with fois gras , with the rib-sticking stuff , like the short-rib sliders or pork belly . it ' s my classic , go-to restaurant in brooklyn . i only regret that ' s ever harder to get into , and i now have to plan ahead for weeknight visits . the secret ' s obviously out , so i no longer have to hold back my praise . 
always a great experience
the worst part about eating here is that you ' ll only have room for one crepe . . . but so many look delicious ! sweet or savory , the choices are amazing . it feels like a truly decadent lunch dinner . the quiet location , the decor and the staff all add up to a place that really reminded me of france . you kind of just want to sit pose around for hours , wearing a beret , arguing about great writers and smoking furiously ( if doing that sort of thing was socially acceptable and didn ' t cause lung cancer ) . the cheap bastard in me had a small heart attack at the price of some of the fillings . i imagine it ' s pretty easy to end up with a N crepe . having said that , everyone knows the best crepe combo ever is butter and brown sugar , so more isn ' t always better in this situation . i would recommend this place for one of those date nights when you ' re really jonesing for an out of this world crepe , or you are trying really hard to get laid by one of those girls that watches foreign films and thinks people are impressed when she drops sartre quotes . note if you have to put up with that , i hope she ' s a ten . 
great place amazing food ! ! ! i love to take my family or business associates there for special occasions . 
went there for dinner during the week . food was awesome . the grilled sirloin was amazing , as well as , a few of the sides . the self serve bottomless draft was perfect , such a great idea . service was nice and the evening i was there they played hiphop all night . was just a great experience for dinner . 
dead at lunch . toasties were the jam , get those ! my salad was just okay , they forgot the avocado . looks like the bar could be awesome at happy hour and into the night . great selection of beers on tap . 
i consider this restaurant in the category of excellent . i have been going to this restaurant for many years . i live in edgewater and i drive over half hour to get there . i do not mind the drive because i know the food is always good . ceviche , shrimp with yellow rice and skirt steak ( churrasco ) are our favorite dishes . my husband is not spanish , however he loves to come to this restaurant . on the weekends the wait is long and there is more noise due to the bar . i do not mind the wait because i love the food . during the week the waiting time is less . i give this restaurant five stars . 
gosh , i ' m a fan ! this place is so cute . great service , won ' t rush you out and eager to answer any questions you may have . i ordered their curry chicken salad , which arrived with generous portions . my friend ordered the coconut fish sandwhich which i was personally jealous that he eyed it on the menu before i did . even more jealous , when he cut off a piece for me to eat ! they also started us off with flat bread that reminded me of a foccacia , served with a yogurt oilive oil sauce . let me say , it was freshly out of the oven because we had to wait a good N minutes to come back . i can ' t wait to take dan t here when he gets back from his nyc hiatus ! 
i absolutely love this place . very reasonable seating and by that i mean i didn ' t feel like i was smashed up against the people eating next to me . the decor is nice , staff was kind . food was fantastic . this is one of my regular places . would highly recommend eating here if you ' re in the area . try the pork buns ! 
being from illinois , i had been looking for a good place to eat pizza . my daughter and i decided to try charlestown house of pizza and were very impressed . the crust on the pizzas are delicious and crispy , the toppings are excellent . our favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza , one of the best i have eaten . i highly recommend this place , it is clean and friendly , as well as good eatin . . . . . i give it four stars , without question . 
loooooooong wait on weekends , but just had to try the famed spotted pig burger . i believe the wait was somewhere between N . N-Nhrs before we were led into the gastropub-like resto and sat down a a small table near the kitchen . we started off with a round of drinks which were nice and strong , despite their small size . for dinner we split the chicken liver the spotted pig burger . unfortunately , we definitely should have asked for the cheese on the side because it is cheesayyyy ! the burger itself was cooked medium rare and was quite good ! too bad the cheese overpowered it for me ) all in all , definitely glad i tried the spotted pig but probably would not return . 
definitely a great place to have authentic viet food . spicy and hot noodle traditional made , great price also . 
i ' ve lived in this neighborhood for years and for whatever reason never ventured into ichiban . monte alban , abyssinian , tisane the half door ? yes . all of the above - just never this addition to my usual west end lineup . at least in terms of sushi , i wasn ' t missing much . after walking to cvs for a few things with my boyfriend , we impulsively decided we didn ' t feel like cooking and ducked into ichiban on the way home . the interior is decent enough - dark wood , sushi bar , and service was okay - a little slow . i started with an avocado sesame salad , which was extremely generous with the avocado ( like an entire avocado sliced on top ) and flavorful dressing . nick ' s bibimbap came as another highlight although the kimchee was lackluster ( he likes it spicy and stankyyyyyyy ) and the egg was too fried so the yolk couldn ' t mix in with the other meal accoutrements . my sushi was as bland as could be , despite the paradise roll sounding quite good . salmon tuna coated with mango . . . . except the mango was drenched in this creepy , flavorless mango-colored goo and a squiggle of mayo . i had to scrape it all off . overall , i might eventually return to try some non-sushi dishes , but probably no time soon . 
coq au vin was great ! incredible ambiance , very parisian staff . the go-to french restaurant of the west village . pesto di noci wasn ' t too great though
the owner and staff at edison ale house cares nothing about the patrons that dine in their establishment . i got ill from an entree that was served , and i immediately called the restaurant and spoke with two managers , rick and nicolette , who promised to refund my tab as a way of apologizing , but never did ! ! i also asked to speak with the owners , tom or nick , numerous times . they never returned any of my calls . as a restaurant where customer service is essential , they fail miserably and turn their backs on the patrons that keep them in business . the food and staff are horrific and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone ! ! shame on them ! 
came here for a company related dinner event we ordered from the pre-fixed menu . i had the grilled octopus for appetizer , and the sea urchin , and the lobster for entree . everything was delicious and prepared just right ! and you can tell they use superb quality ingredients . when the octopus came out , i was thinking , the portion is tiny ! but after all the food , i was stuffed ! the octopus was grilled so tender and soft and seasoned nicely . the sea urchin was served with seaweed , sesame seeds on a floor of sticky rice ! delicious ! the lobster was fresh and tender and cooked to perfection in this creamy sauce everything was great ! including the ambiance and the service ! i don ' t mind coming back here to splurge a bit ! 
i ' m a woman of a " certain age , " and remember going to the reading terminal market with my mother , when i was a young tween . she would . . . all but . . . swear-by-it ! for her , it was the place to be on a saturday morning . she loved the meats , the chubby ' s , the fish , and the variety of vendor ' s . over the past year , i have been there several times , and i must say that , " i do not share my mother ' s affinity for it . " although it ' s not bad , and you still have a variety of vendors , i ' m not totally impressed . but , i still enjoy the seafood restaurant . 
really good ! the small order is enough to split between two people , and you can order more than one sauce . i only tried the mango chutney and the pinapple one . the mango was good , pinapple was just okay . you have to try this place at least once ! 
are you kiddin me ? and have george put a hit out on me for scoring him less than perfect ? not me , pal . seriously , teddy ' s is about community , and family , and old fashioned values . meet george and wendy and donna and sherry and the whole team . great people . 
we went here for a work happy hour , so we had the upstairs area to ourselves which was nice . there was a lot of food . . . . -salmon burger - pretty good , definitely had better . the coleslaw was good . -mashed sweet potatoes - awesome ! -onion rings - no . soo greeesy it was gross . -fries - pretty average , but the dipping sauces were all delicious -chicken wings - were great ! the chicken was super moist fall of the bone , and the dry rub is so much better than having it deep fried and drenched in bad sauce . so def a thumbs up ! -bbq sliders - delicious ! ! also definitely recommend . sweet , soft and flavorful -homemade ice cream - it was ok , we had banana and peanut butter . -peanut butter pie - wow . . so good and rich . but try to split it between like N-N people so you don ' t have a mini sugar coma . it tastes like dense whipped cream butter . so good ! ! ! -bread pudding - no . it came out as a block of dense bread soaked in some pudding . i usually like bread pudding when it ' s a big sweet mushy mess . . . not a loaf the waitress was really nice and we had good service . the place is pretty loud , especially after N when they turn up the music . also , the upstairs bathroom is not pleasant . just fyi so overall it ' s ok but not my first choice ! 
hi . i am tania from prive event planning feel free to text me at N-N-N to get vip admission with me at skyroom nightclub friday night , asia from the pussycat dolls will be performing ! also feel free to store my number and name because i plan some of the best parties in nyc . 
the perfect brunch ! i can ' t say enough about the food , the locale , the servers . . . i only wish they were located in medford . it was definitely worth the drive into " town " 
the service here is so atrocious . sure , the food is good , but definitely not good enough to make dealing with the wait time and pompous , rude , forgetful wait staff worth it . clearly the management needs to readdress their no reservation policy , or hire many more people . their tiny wait staff can in no way handle " remembering " who gets the next table amongst crowds of people standing around , while being a waiter for everyone at the tables and bar . after waiting an hour for a table , an hour for food , and being treated so rudely the whole time by the little french waiter , i came out of here fuming . never again . 
advertised as the first pizzeria in america , we had to give it a try . the cons they don ' t sell slices , they ' re not really take-out friendly ( from our experience ) , we spent N for a large pie with two-half toppings ( tax tip ) , and they don ' t take credit cards . the pros the pizza ' s really good . we tried half garlic sauteed spinach and half pepperoni , and surprisingly , my buddies preferred the spinach topping . we arrived at N pm on a weekday , and seating was plentiful . 
easily one of my favorite brunches this summer . this texan family makes their own biscuits and jams in house and the result is delicious . i had their version of a croque madame on a bicuit with mushroom gravy , which was creamy but not too heavy . my meal was so satisfying . they serve great coffee and the staff and owners are extremely friendly and attentive . i ' ll probably go back for some fried chicken tomorrow ! 
i can only give this place two stars for the simple fact that they do not put pepperoni or sausage on their pizza . i consider such a thing to be a abomination to the great edible creation we call pizza . if they put these things on their slices i would give it five stars . their margarita pizza is the best i ' ve ever had though . 
best burger in williamsburg , period ! plus they sometime have really hot girls working there . good eye candy while you chow down on your awesome burger and fries . 
the food was awesome . no problems there . much better than food at other pubs in other cities which attract people who don ' t want to blow their budget . kitchen staff need to be commended . what sucks is their service . absolutely not impeccable , which i don ' t expect anyway but come on . N minute wait for beers after ordering them ? same amount of time waiting for food . brought out the food , no silverware , no napkins , nothing , just food . not even our drinks . eventually brought everything else out . came back and brought us the bill , divided up into Nrds . we pay him , then he brings back the receipt for N bills with our change , then walks away . sorry but you don ' t get tipped for sucking at serving . and when you come back to us and say " oh i only gave you two receipts , sorry , my head is all over the place and i ' m all confused , " don ' t expect sympathy from us . i ' m sorry man , you shouldn ' t be working in the food industry if you can ' t keep track of something so menial as a receipt . i don ' t want to sound harsh , i really wanted to like this place , and again , the food was great , but the service is terrible . 
love this place ! decently priced for the experience . greeted in japanese , great staff ( kitchen , waiters , hostesses ) , modern decor , upbeat , great food . on separate occasions , i had the ramen ( delicious ) and a salad ( i think it had shrimp in it ) , both great ! bar area up in front , haven ' t tried that yet , but would love to go back . you can dress this place up or down . date place ? yes . 
best beef noodle soup in the area . you can also try the braised pork on rice or pan fried beef bun . and the price is fair . 
i really liked forte ' s . i went to a high school right in the area , and after school on some days , my friends and i would grab a slice of pizza before heading home . i love their white pizza with broccoli . the restaurant itself was a little sketchy looking , but i know it moved and i haven ' t been inside the new place yet . slices here are huge . 
went last night besides it being like a armed camp with a group undercover cops ( making sure you see their badges and guns ) hovering outside in parking lot and making you feel like you are committing a crime by parking in the lot which holds all of about N cars . the place was packed like a school cafeteria and the same atmosphere to boot . strollers , baby high-chairs , small children crying . . you name it . . . etc . for take out ( N to N min wait ) you stand in a long line ( almost back out the front door ) right next to a family eating at a table at your waist line level ugh . the thin crust pizza is at best ok and expensive , the large size is the size of a domino ' s small . i would not plan a date there . star has become like most businesses when they start getting word of mouth and print advertising , the quality of the product goes down because now they are only looking for fast money profit . the service is like a truck stop - unprofessional and discourteous . the workers really let you know they would rather be someplace else ( and still get paid , of course ) . years ago in the N ' s and N ' s , star was excellent , food was carefuly prepared . i definitely wont go back . 
the noodles were flavorful and the whole concoction honestly tasted like a soupy vegetable pot pie to me ! service was very attentive , and waiters were very welcoming of the group on and even walked us through what we could couldn ' t order on the menu with it . overall , we ' re really glad we went and will probably go again to taste some other dishes . 
i like coming here after the gym to get some low cal but healthy food despite the overpriced food . but this might just be the last time . they offer a special on paninis before noon where you get one for N instead of N or N . however , some of the waiters seem to have difficulty charging the correct price . you also get N off your bill if you show a receipt from a day within the past week . they also seem to have an issue with honoring this discount . 
the best food in bushwick can be found in ridgewood , queens . right here at bunker . gauntlet thrown ! everything lacking in many restaurants in my hood is here in abundance quality ingredients - fresh , crisp , ripe produce , thoughtfully sourced and perfectly prepared meats and seafood , nice atmosphere - at a reasonable price point . add in the most important element - that its prepared with serious craftsmanship an artists hand here and it all leads to a seriously blissed out dining experience . highlights of this oh-so-good meal crab ban xeo crisp savory and delightful fried crepe stuffed with crunchy fresh bean sprouts you wrap in tender lettuce leaves and dip in sweet sauce . did i mention there ' s bacon in the mix ? yes , bacon . salad special of the day succulent roasted quail , happily slightly pink on the inside , on watercress salad studded with chopped dates , thin slices of ripe persimmon , chunks of fresh jewel-like tomato and walnuts . cha ca - two fillets of off the hook salmon surrounded by fresh herbs and a sprinkle of crispy fried garlic atop a fluffy bed of vermicelli . a dish you simultaneously want to keep completely to yourself but have to share because it ' s too damned good . positively luscious vietnamese iced coffee served over shaved ice - sweet , rich , and potent with the perfect ratio of coffee to condensed milk . love . 
omg this place hits the spot . peak hours a potential waiting list . great place to bring tourist friends , especially the ones who think japanese food automatically means sushi . 
having been to di fara on other occasions , the pizza when made well is great tasting but ultimately the negatives have at last for me out weighted the pluses . cost a bit high even if it is good , inconsistent in quality , never acceptable from the top performers add this to the excessive waits with no fairness in who ends of waiting the longest just ends it for me . in ny we are fortunate to have many great pizzerias , especially now that the real deal italian movement has arrived and i ' d rather spend my time eating and drinking with friends at equally good places than waiting . . . and waiting . . . and . . . if you really like this place , do them a favor and stop going for awhile , it might get them to treat their customers better . 
the pies here are not worth more than N . terrible . i ' d rather eat cardboard ! 
i ' ve been to hip city veg several times and each time i ' m greeted by polite staff waiting to answer any questions i might have about the menu . the food is extremely tasty and doesn ' t leave me with that i over ate wasted my workout feeling . the menu is supposed to be fairly healthy . with that said its disappointing not to see any information on calories and macros listed on the menu . i think hip city is a welcome addition to the fast casual scene . i recommend the crispy chicken sandwich and a order of sweet potato fries . 
nice place . . . . . . . very good food . . . . . . good service . . . . . . overpriced wine . . . . . . . hard to find with goofy new york street configuration . definitely a spot to try . at least once . lots of other places to try before i would return . 
great experience , especially the service . highly recommended . great walk through the theater district from times square . 
the pancakes here are pretty damn good , but i ' m not so sure these pancakes are worth the the long wait , good . i had to order the blueberry pancakes , since everyone had nothing but marvelous things to say about them . and yes i would have to agree-they ' re a must , if you do choose to endure the absurd wait . maybe if there staff were a little more attentive to the guests , the line wouldn ' t be out the door . if i return i will have to head the advice of others and either come first thing in the morning or try them out on a weekday . 
i have been here twice , both on tuesday evenings for dinner . the place is pretty small . you need to squeeze past others to get to your seat , and then you ' ll be listening to their conversations throughout your meal . however , the food is excellent . there are many different cold , warm , and dipping soba options , and neat little appetizers like fermented tofu and tuna liver . all of the ingredients are really fresh and delicious , and the menu is cutely decorated with cartoons . i really enjoyed the warm dipping soba with eel and avocado if i recall correctly , it had " dragon " in the name and was a seasonal special . several vegetarian and vegan options are available , too . the service is friendly and efficient . i do think it ' s a bit expensive , but this is the only soba restaurant i have ever been to , so i don ' t know if this is standard . 
i had been wanting to try this place for awhile , and although i do not know much about ethiopian food , i found the food to be very tasty . i ordered the vegetarian platter and enjoyed all of the samples , especially the potato and cabbage portions . people are spot on when they call ethiopian food an earthy version of indian food our server was very helpful and pleasant . he gave us suggestions on which beers to try , and guided us in how to eat our ethiopian food , which is with your hands . the food came out in a timely manner and the water was filled consistently . other reviewers have commented that the service and atmosphere is not very professional , but one must remember that this is small , local , family owned environment and that the same service from a high class N star restaurant can not be expected . 
hanco ' s is my banh mi of choice in brooklyn . they ' re super quick to deliver and their sandwiches are bombtastical . i ' m also hooked on their taro bubble teas ! it ' s my go-to-dinner when i ' m starving after a long day at work and i ' m too lazy to cook . 
i went to this place for the first time today and loved it . i will admit i had pretty low expectations just judging on appearance outside and inside , but the food did not disappoint . i wanted to order the chicken burger but they were out of buns so i got a chicken quesedilla instead . i ' m assuming since we went there around N that ' s why they didn ' t have rolls , which was a little annoying but my quesadilla was awesome . i chose a spinach tortilla which turned out to be really good . my friend ordered the chicken cheesesteak and loved it as well . the only reason this place is getting N stars not N is because there were only two people working and the line was pretty long . putting that aside . . i will definitely be making frequent visits to this place . 
this after three suppers . . . the food was all at least good , with some dishes excellent . the foie gras with an egg on top maple syrup was exceptional in its subtle sweetness . i really can ' t stand when foie gras is overly syrupy sweet , so good job , chef ! maybe possibly perhaps it was my favorite foie gras ever ! the short rib sliders beet salad were also good , as were other things i ' m sure i can ' t remember . food quibbles . . . the chicken wings need a little work , and i wish there were more more more vegetables on the menu . the last time i went with a friend who doesn ' t eat seafood . other than a small shared salad , it was kind of a heavy meal of meat-n-such and more meat-n-such . i guess the pork shellfish concept is good for getting press , but it can feel a little dogmatic gimmicky--for example , the cocktail with the bacon rim or the bacon doughnuts . they may or may not be delicious . i wouldn ' t know . it just seems like someone is looking at the world through bacon colored glasses . however , they probably wouldn ' t have been reviewed by the atlantic without " the concept , " so i guess it ' s good for them . i just might possibly get over it after a while . now , the one thing . . . the decor . there ' s a long bar along the open kitchen that runs much of the depth of the restaurant . it ' s not well designed , so it ' s always been completely empty the times i ' ve been . maybe the inspiration was momofuku , i don ' t know , but there are too many stools , so close they ' re touching . why so many if they ' re all empty ? when you enter , it creates a feeling of a grande , inhospitable void . the overhang doesn ' t look deep enough , so maybe a good forward lean and kneepads would be necessary . this is the biggest thing , the counter , but also the wall art , color scheme , and umm , the . . . maybe just hire a interior designer . hopefully not the edison bulb kind , though . too much of that already . also , i like the waitstaff . they ' re nice . 
pommes frites , as frites as the pommes go , as frites as the winds blow , pommes frites ! ok , if you ' re too young to remember the song " born free " or you have no idea who elsa the lion is , that intro makes no sense to you , so i ' ll make this review more simple and timely . best . fries . ever . 
terrible place for parents with kids . we tried at the early evening hours since that ' s just what we do when we go with kids . although there were open tables , we got told that it ' d be a N minute wait not once , not twice , but three different times . the final time that we swung by there were over half of the tables completely open , they had just open , and nobody waiting to be seated , and yet it would be a N minute wait for us , a party of four ! staff was rude and unapologetic until we walked out the door with a quick ' so sorry ' . we ' re never going back . 
it ' s ok , not the cleanest place , crowded too , overpriced drinks . 
ordered their pork bahn mi . came quickly and was delicious . ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful . their catfish banh mi was also good . ordered their hot vietnamese coffee but when it was served to me it was only lukewarm . their need to increase the temp of their brew . overall a pleasant experience and will def be headed back when i have a craving for a bahn mi sandwich . 
this is the second time i ' ve gone to this restaurant . i was actually walking by on a wednesday , thinking to go somewhere else on crown st . but they were open so we went . i thought they only did thursdays - saturdays but now they do wednesday too . i had the skirt steak which i actually loved . the marinade was extremely flavorful and it was super tender . i still really like this place . it ' s between casual and fancy . it ' s where i ' d like to on my birthday kind of a place . 
scrumptious gnocchi , skate , and coq au van . friendly waitstaff and nice environment . service was a little slow but they had a party in the back-room that was tying everything up . . . the food more than made up for it . 
you come to pat ' s and geno ' s for the history more than the food quality . while they still argue over who was first , i ' ll let you be the judge as to whose tastes better . and since they are literally across the street from each other , i encourage you to do what we ' ve always done and try them both for that real philly experience . besides , dinging either one of these places for taste would be like giving the liberty bell a bad rating because it has a crack in it and doesn ' t ring pure anymore . these places are historic institutions and the heart of some of philly ' s heritage . with that said , i ' ve been coming here since the N ' s and for my money right now have a slight leaning towards geno ' s . here ' s my breakdown pat ' s dryer bread and meat crunchy onions cheaper wiz harsher service geno ' s juicy meat carmelized onions steamed roll gooey cheese friendlier staff while they are both institutions , i prefer to have that greasy , juicy flavor dripping off my cheesteak . a couple final recommendations before stepping up to the window read the instructions and learn the lingo . it ' s rather simple and broken down into but three steps . and bring cash , they don ' t take plastic . this will definitely make your experience a more memorable one . both of these places are famous for a reason and one of those " must-see-stops " on a tour of philadelphia . 
i agree about the borderline hostile waitstaff , but i also can ' t blame them because the place is so small . they ' re kind of forced to operate more like nurses trying to rush you out of your hospital bed for the next warm butt . go for the pizza ( which deserves five stars ! ) . bring a bottle of wine . the pepperoni is delicious . . . i can ' t stop thinking about it . and definitely get garlic as a topping--it made a big difference . if you ' re all up in a knot about the waitstaff or if you ' re making this your " destination pizza place , " you may be setting yourself up for disappointment . not that the pizza disappoints . . . it certainly doesn ' t . but if you ' re coming with those expectations you ' re going to be too hard on the experience . it ' s truly incredible pizza . get it take-out if you don ' t like the atmosphere . 
i love the concept . it ' s setup like a little subway for mediterranean food ! it ' s nothing fancy . you simply walk up to the counter and select the ingredients to put inside your falafel , salad , or shawarma . in addition to the traditional falafel balls , i loaded mine up with lettuce , hummus , peppers , corn , feta cheese , carrots ( yea carrots ) and tahini sauce . for under N it ' s a real bargain and quite filling . i much prefer this concept where i select my own ingredients rather than the mamouns concept where they do it for you . i even love the little cardboard pouch that holds the falafel ( see photo ) . a nice touch . the only thing i didn ' t like was the pita bread . it was the really thick store bought kind . it ' s the kind my mom used to buy that turned me off to pita bread at a young age . it wasn ' t horrible but there are better pita breads out there . however i gotta say the numerous positives outweight this one negative . . . oh and they ' re only open until N N pm . that ' s kind of a bummer . 
although i am not a fan of the name change ( shinju was so much cooler ) , they got everything else right . first fs kept everything good about about the old spot ( namely the fresh and innovative sushi ) and fixed the things that were holding it back from sushi greatness , namely - more tables translates into shorter lines - more space tables are further apart ( you can still talk to your neighbors , you just don ' t have to anymore ) - more sushi chefs less time waiting ( and drooling over your neighbors food ) bottom line this is the best sushi for your in philly ! 
i ate at this place years ago and i have to say the food was good . but . . . i called the place during the day to get hours of operation and to ask if you need reservations . the place was closed and the recording stated the hours and then said " do not try to make a reservation on this machine " . ok . . so when can you make a reservation ? i stood in front of the place for N minutes the other night with a small crowd and at N N pm sharp someone came out and read off names for reservations . finally the woman asked who ' s next and when we said " we are " she said come back in Nhr and N min . yea rite . . . never again . . . they didn ' t even apologize to the left over ppl standing for not haven ' t anymore tables available at that time . we drove over to paulie gees in greenpoint which was about N-N mins further away and had the best meal ever . 
we held a birthday party celebration here last week with N guests . it went extremely well . the pre planning could not have been easier as the staff was extremely accommodating and attentive to our needs . everything ran smoothly on the day of . i highly recommend this restaurant for it ' s ambience , service , and quality of food . our guests loved it and so did we ! ! ! 
usually eating with family can be a huge pain . usually fusion food is not my favorite usually i don ' t venture to the les on weekdays . yerba buena , i made exceptions for you , and thankfully , my instincts were right . you were worth it . as a group of N , we opted to order several appetizers and N entrees to share , family style . out of the appetizers , i really enjoyed the ceviche , the tangy vinegar was a perfect balance , and the pine nuts added to the texture . the entrees were much more memorable than the appetizers , and i enjoyed most of them , in particular , the chicken . i ' m usually hesitant to order chicken since it has a tendency to be too dry . . . . but , yerba buena exceeded my expectations . i had a great time dining and enjoying my family ' s company here - can ' t wait to return and try out their drinks menu . 
there is loads of good here . excellent burger and salads . smart seasonal offerings . breakfast sandwich is too-too rich . i like fat and butter in the morning as much as the next guy , but . . . anyway , modern-urban-american-comfort food as good as anywhere in the N boroughs ! 
the organic coffee of the day was amazing . had the eggs in a mug with feta and spinach for breakfast , it came out fresh and hot but with only one detectable crumble of fete cheese and maybe N baby spinach leaves . i could have done without hearing the conversation that the employees were having behind the counter , some sort of personal drama . i would go back for the great coffee and perhaps try a pastry . 
huge ! ! save the other half for later or just share with a friend . great experience worth the money spending on ! 
just recently discovered this place . have been back maybe N times in the past few months . i keep going back to this place for one simple reason . the food is great . the roast chicken is tender and delicious . the ceviche is sooooo good . the rest is also very good . depending on your appetite and cost only about N . chicken alone is worth the price . the restaurant itself tends to be calm and friendly . service is fast and graceless . i wish i could give the place N stars . . . oh yes . . almost forgot about the flan . . . . the best thing ever ! ! ! ! ! ! go there now
i ' m pretty sure the kona grill ripped off part of its interior design from the bellagio hotel in vegas but the restaurants is a very beautiful place with its morning glory style lamp shades and venetian glass flowers near the sushi bar . also when you first walk in , there is a giant salt water tank filled with tasty looking fish behind the hostess stand . i say tasty because there is a large puffer fish with " fugu " written all over him just swimming in circles lackadaisically around his little apartment . . . . unbeknown to him that he is being watched ever so closely . my last trip here this weekend , i came just to eat sushi . oh and to drink . since there was a N minute wait for a table , my party took to the bar and we each ordered a drink . i asked the bartender point blank which one of their cocktails were strong . he told me with honesty that " none of them are strong actually . " i told him i appreciated his honesty and asked him to make me a strong drink . he procures a vodka cranberry . now ok , i admit i was buzzed already from drinking N glasses of wine at my friend ' s house prior to coming but i did not taste a drop of alcohol in my glass . i then asked my friend who was sober if she tasted any , and she said no . i then became one of those patrons who told the bartender it wasn ' t that strong and sweetly asked if there was anyway he could please make me a stronger drink . pwetty pwease big smile . . . i received my second drink just as we were told our table was ready . i grabbed it and we were led to our table . my second drink was just as weak . boooooo . we asked our table waiter if he could please have it remade again . yes i was being a little obnoxious but i wanted a strong drink ! how hard is that ? ! bah . for my meal , i decided to stick with sushi since i remembered from my previous time here that i didn ' t love their fusion entrees that much . for an appetizer , i had a miso soup and the three of us split the lobster and ahi tuna flatbread . the flatbread was particularly appetizing and my miso soup was good but nothing special . it had a solid broth and was hot . for my sushi , i ordered some nigiri and a roll . for nigiri ( raw fish on top of rice ) i had the salmon , yellowtail , albacore tuna and sweet shrimp . for my roll i went with my old faithful and got the spicy tuna roll . the sushi was of decent quality ( not orgasmic but good ) and i enjoyed the fact that they put a tiny dab of wasabi underneath the fish like they are supposed to do . it gave my nose a pleasant little burn . the spicy tuna roll was yummy . i couldn ' t finish all of them ( sad face ) but i tried . of the nigiri , the salmon was probably my favorite followed by the sweet shrimp and albacore . when we got our bill , it was about N for the three of us which included our drinks . not bad considering how much we drank and ate . i saw that they charged me twice for my drink and i drunkenly asked the waiter why i was charged twice when i had returned it twice practically full . he said he would fix it then a manager came over . . . . whoops . she asked us how our meal went and that she had the extra drink taken off our bill . very good kona ( as i sigh in relief that they aren ' t kicking me out ) and thanks . ok i wasn ' t that bad but i ' m sure i got their attention haha . i ' m actually excited to go back here again . . . . seeing as there aren ' t a ton of options out in this part of jersey , kona grill is a solid place to go to . i would stick to the sushi though but that ' s just me . i love sushi ! i ' m not a big fusion fan when it comes to asian cuisine . next time i want to be more hungry and try out more of their rolls . maybe i ' ll feel differently once i have their food sober but all in all i really enjoyed my experience here ( even though i had my drink replaced twice ) ! 
fine . cheap beer . darts pool . locals . irish pub good time . no food after N Npm but we were able to order pizza delivered . . . 
overrated . became extremely ill after trying their cheesesteak . many others around philly are better . 
i returned to burger baby for lunch today and was blown away yet again . they have a contest running right now where apparently , customers submitted there ideas for burgers , and the five best ideas are now available , and whichever gets the most votes ( orders ) gets a permanent spot on the menu . i think its running for the next three weeks . i ordered the " triple smoke , " which was one of there specially-blended burger patties , seasoned with chipotle and paprika , and topped with avacado , bacon , raw red onion , cilantro and chipotle aioli . it was a fantastic combination . another thing i love about the place is that they can take care of just about any special requests without a problem . i am low-carbing for a few weeks before my wedding , so i opted for the side-salad instead of fries , and asked for no bun . my plate came beautifully assembled , and it was probably the most delicious and gorgeous burger salad i ' ve ever eaten . i ' m going back again soon for one of the other limited-time burgers . 
it is the first australian restaurant in astoria ( the first one i know of ) . the food is really good . my favorite on the menu is the fish tacos . the place is cute
i had a business lunch here . it was a little sloppy for talking numbers and stats , but the food was good and the ambience is charming . 
good typical take-out in strip mall . . . . . they also have buffet and plenty of seating
this is really the best sit down pizza ever . there is always a long wait but well worth it for delicious pizza . good selections , tasty sauce , just the right cheese , and a nice thin and crispy crust . you order it by pies . pro awesome pizza . by far , one of the best in the us . authentic and they put a lot of passion into it . good selection con long wait , not the cleanest nicest decor . it ' s nothing fancy here . the prices are fair . overview would go back . 
i went here the other night with a big group of friends . we waited for a group table and and got a few drinks . great beer on tap . when we got our table our server was on point . kept our drinks filled and took the order in a timely fashion . food was spectacular . salads , pizzas , you name it we got it . nice work ! ! 
when looking for a brunch place in the carroll gardens-boerum hill-cobble hill area ( and i guess red hook too ) , consider the fact that frankie ' s has the best quality food in the hood . hands down , no one else can touch them for the quality of food . the space is really the perfect small dining room and facilitates a great experience . the wait can be depressing , but hopefully with the weather getting cooler the lines will shorten . everyone has an opinion on the service at frankie ' s , so here ' s mine . i think the wait staff are totally competent - the problem is that this is one of those restaurants that insists on not assigning a waitress to a table . . . and the whole shared approach never works in practice . it ' s a nice theory that you ' ll end up with better service when the wait staff share all the tables , but the reality is that the core wait staff has to work a lot more to achieve a decent level of service . . . and yesterday it was very apparent who was working harder than others - a few rock star waitresses had to make up for the space cadets . it ' s also kind of impossible to leave frankie ' s without a crush on a waitress . 
drinks special are great for the quality you receive . it ' s N bucks can elevate your night . friend personnel , great place to network . i support local businesses . come visit this place and enjoy a good meal and good drinks . laugh it up . only thing you might worry about is the seating . the place was made exclusive for a reason . can get a lil tight . but enjoy . 
lupa is a beautiful place . the food is cooked and seasoned to perfection ( what you would expect from a celebrity chef like mario batali ) , the price is a little high ( though affordable and definitely cheaper than celebrity chefs like gorden ramsey and the portions are small so expect to do the italian thing and order a couple dishes . this is the real deal italian too so don ' t expect to find fettuccine alfredo or meatballs here ( an initial disappointment for me but after i had what was offered i forgot about the boyaredee version of the italian cuisine ) . this place is classy so make sure to make a reservation and leave your t-shirt at home if you want to complete the lupa experience
brunch here was amazing . came with family on an unseasonably warm new year ' s eve , so we sat outside . pretty view of the park , fantastic breakfast pastries , delicious tea , and some of the best french toast and potatoes known to man . if i lived in philly i ' d be here every weekend . 
i ' ve previously been to the old location , just down the street but was curious to see what the long awaited return back to k-town would be like . when i came here , there was a slight wait , and it was packed even on a week night . although this is one of the main spots for most people wanting to fulfill their korean food cravings , i didn ' t find it to be particularly spectacular . don ' t get me wrong , it was a good meal , i just feel that this place is overall is a little over hyped . the renovation and new location is really nice . there are beautiful high ceilings and two levels of seating which makes the restaurant quite spacious . the staff here is also friendly , helpful and attentive , which is very rare in k-town . what ' s great about this place is that it ' s open N hours- so perfect for when you have reached your max of drunkenness and need to fulfill those munchies cravings ! bcd tofu house would not be living up to their name if their best dishes weren ' t their tofu stews . the tofu is super silky which is great but i think just slightly lacking in flavor . however , i ' m obsessed with tofu and am a huge fan of the tofu stews . . . and it is my favorite dish to get here . while you are waiting for your orders , the place mats have cute phrases for you to learn in korean ! they also bring over copious amounts of small dishes for you to chomp on while you wait . overall , a solid restaurant that i will come back , i personally just don ' t feel that this is the holy grail of korean restaurants that everyone claims it to be . 
this place just never disappoints . my wife and i ate here on saturday , june Nth , N . . . . she had the blackened catfish and i had pork tenderloins and both dishes were extremely tasty . looking for a break from pasta and tomato sauce here on staten island ? try bayou ! 
the penne vodka at manninos N is amazing . just absolutely amazing . it is the best penne vodka in town , and i go there at least twice a week to eat it . honestly , i would wholeheartedly recommend it , and you should all go there . it ' s the best penne vodka in new jersey i have never tasted anything better . 
i love macaroons . . . . i really love macaroons . for N . N a piece , they better be knock your socks off great . i didn ' t feel that these little guys lived up to all the hype ( and the price ) i ' ve been hearing about . they were solid , and the flavors were rich , but i ' ve had better . the shells were a big soggy and lacked that incredible light crunch you would get with really freshly baked macaroons . i got a caramel and coffee flavors ( for breakfast i might add ! ) . the service was fine , but rather pretentious . the main lure of this romantic bakery is really the decor , and the typically french romance of the advertising and products ( candles and other assorted gifts ) . it ' s worth a visit to experience the charm , but pass on the sweets . 
very cute date spot , family owned and operated and very polite helpful service . great recommendations as well as phenomenal specials off the menu . i had the " mexican special platter " it had steak , chorizo , beans , fried plantains , avocado and egg . it was a bunch of different flavors put together with a homemade hot sauce . great for a quick dinner or cute date for two . 
my opinion- i believe the staff is prejudice ! my child tried to purchase food here and he was treated as if he was beneath and turned away . some adults should show more respect to children and set a far better example regardless of the situation- especially when running an establishment . i was at the hair salon down the street and i was unable to go with him to purchase his food therefore i gave him my debit card and he was turned away . ( second attempt ) i sent a note including my signature stating that he had my permission to purchase the food via my debit card . ( third attempt ) one of the workers at the salon offered to go as evidence that i was a current customer of their establishment and i could not walk down to pick up the food . ( fourth and final attempt ) i then placed the order over the phone and advised the cashier of the situation and that he will be picking up the food and i even suggested paying over the phone and she advised me that it was not a problem for him to use my card since i was placing the order . when my son arrived and the owner noticed him leaving with his order , the owner came around the counter and began banging on the counter and told my son to put the food down and felt the need to yell at him . my son is a very intelligent kid and he was extremely bothered by the way this adult handled the situation over a N . N meal . my son was simply doing what his mother advised him to do and it was shown that he was indeed the bigger person in the situation . i am proud that he handled it very well and i will continue to teach my children the right and wrong way to act in this society regardless of others shortcomings and ill mannered ways . knowledge will forever govern ignorance and people who mean to be their own governors , must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives ! 
when frequently meal dinner the restaurant it ' s home made and organic . the owners built the place by hand , and it shows - in a good way . it ' s a place obviously built with love and with care . the food yes , i ' ve had their fried chicken . and as you can tell by most of the other reviews , it ' s pretty darn good . but each time i ' ve gone there , i ' ve always told my guest that the side salad is better than the chicken . none believed me . by the end of the night , they all told me they ' d exchange a piece of the chicken for more of the salad . it ' s that good . the duck confit tastes good . the peanut brittle isn ' t as spectacular as i would have hoped ( but the bacon is a nice touch ) . the pork is juicy and tender . let someone else order the fried chicken explore what this menu has to offer and steal some of their chicken ( and have a bite of their salad before they do ) . final verdict ? i ' ve been here multiple times and i love it . i ' ve yet to have a bad experience . word to the wise arrive early . this place can get pretty busy real fast . 
when i walked in , i immediately liked the atmosphere and was looking forward to dining here . we sat down , and the server offered us complimentary still or sparkling water , which was definitely an extra treat . i received my sparking water , which was philly tap water with several bubbles - it definitely was not sparkly ! - and this was the beginning of my disappointment . i had the beet salad , which sounded great but was very mediocre . there was barely any goat cheese to be found , and the yellow beets were good but the red beets were so soaked in vinegar that i couldn ' t even eat them . the salad needed salt , which was not to be found on the table . i then got the kennett pizza , which sounded fantastic ( with a bechamel sauce and several varieties of mushrooms ) but was also a disappointment i thought it would be incredibly rich but it was actually lacking in seasoning and flavor . this very much needed salt , as well . again , the atmosphere was nice - warm and rustic and urban - and the food was definitely not bad , but i would certainly not rush back . 
dishes were too salty , the atmosphere was blah and the waitresses were not pleasant
dirty and greasy . the food tastes burnt and literally smoky . i don ' t think they clean their kitchen on a yearly basis . definitely would not recommend this awful place . 
i applaud these guys for the success they have worked so hard for and they deserve every drop . that being said , no bad mojo going your way . i wish you many more years of success . i ' ve been dying to try this grilled cheese since it ' s beginnings . i stopped one afternoon on york st . for a bite . N is a little steep for a grilled cheese and i don ' t care what type of artisanal cheese you ' re using . oily to the point where i burned the tip of my tongue trying to bite into it . is it flavorful ? absolutely , but very oily . grilled cheese is a simple concept , but the flare they add with the add ons is very creative and flavorful . workers are very pleasant to deal with . line moves at a steady pace . just that price is steep . i can go to the corner of york and elm and get a huge burrito or cheese quesadilla for N ( not the guy across from au bon pain ) and still have some left over for dinner . again , these guys are out there hustling , doing a good job and are very nice . i can say that i tried it and encourage others to do the same at least once and have them decide on their own . 
snobby and expensive , bartenders only good thing about this joint
i ordered the ninja sashimi special and was very impressed . fish had unique textures and was a delight . i found the tuna to be as buttery as other place ' s salmon , and the salmon was so soft i thought it would melt off my chopstick my wife ordered the butterfly roll and we were both impressed with the flavors , fresh and high quality . the miso and salad are forgettable and felt obligatory and are not as well crafted as the sashimi or special rolls . decor photography is low res off the internet prints but unique . looking forward to exploring more of menu ! . . . and getting another groupon deal . 
just back from brunch , and it only reaffirmed my already high opinion of this place -- a real neighborhood gem , our go-to spot when my wife and i want to eat like foodie hipsters but aren ' t in the mood for attitude and house music . chef rob halpern ( who on all our visits has made a point of personally greeting every diner ) is one of the most gifted new talents in town -- as the inky ' s craig lebon recently acknowledged in his year-end wrap up . the menu is up-to-the-minute-- think sous vide and flavored foam accents-- without feeling like science experiments run amok . ( on a recent trip to la ' s sona i was served " smoke " ice cream , which tasted like some unholy collaboration between ben jerry phillip morris . ) atmosphere is unpretentious and comfortable , and especially cozy in winter with the gas fireplace going . i suspect there are a lot of penn drexel grad students going on first dates here . in summary the place to return to after you ' ve been underwhelmed ( and overcharged ) by one of the hyped restaurants-of-the-moment . 
friends were kicked out for showing affection , gay male couple . . owners explanation was that the restaurant is a family environment . spanks . . . the options are too wide to be bothered at this time and millennium . . . food is not even that great . . 
took my family there tonight for my daughters Nth bday . we enjoyed the food and desserts . reading all the " negative " reviews led me to think this would be a " bite my tongue experience " that i ' d tolerate as this was my daughters choice for her birthday dinner . cheap ? not by a long shot but not as outrageous as i was led to think . we had a good time , the service was attentive and food came out in a timely manner . gotta take these reviews with a grain of salt i guess . 
i lived in nyc brooklyn for over N years and this was simply the best pizza i ' ve had . the old man that runs it has been doing this forever and i ' m glad i had the chance to try his out and see what the fuss is all about . superb pizza at a premium price ! 
i just went to egg the other night and thought it was lovely and warm . really nice staff , good bartender , and the food was great . had the salad since it was one of the only vegetarian offerings and loved the fresh lettuce that wasn ' t too cold and the big blocks of cheese . delicious . though i stuck with coffee to stay warm , i can ' t wait to come back and have a beer . the draft list seems well-selected and there are some interesting ones on there . egg ' s a great addition to the neighborhood - welcome ! can ' t wait for the grand opening ! 
great menu . totally worth the bucks
this place is the place for brunch . my boyfriend brought me here on a sunday morning . . . we waited a bit . between when we got there to when our food arrived at the table about an hour . it was worth every second of waiting ! i would suggest getting here early because by the time we left ( around Npm ) there was a crowd waiting outside . back to the food . . . . i had some sort of eggs benedict , steak , huevos rancheros combination of goodness . it was amazing , and huge ! i couldn ' t finish it all but each bite made my mouth tingle . my boyfriend had these nutella type french toasts and they looked amazing . i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys brunch as much as i do . 
with over N reviews , what more could i possibly have to add ? their food is solid , but i dreaaam of their tori ( chicken ) ramen . when i lived in ny i would walk a few blocks out of the way from union square to scope out short lines and have tried pretty much everything on their regular , non-seasonal menu . the tori ramen has a light clear broth flavored with a shiso leaf , and thin noodles . everything about that ramen is damn beautiful , down to the bowl it ' s served in . unlike many ramens , it doesn ' t rely on bold or rich flavors yet stands on its own . now that i ' m in ca i ' ve yet to encounter anything like it . when i ' m ill i wish there ' s a teleporter to take me to ippudo so i can guzzle that broth to good health . 
great food in a lively setting . handmade pastas are as good as any in the city . rabbit was tender and tasty . excellent wine list
as far as midtown restaurants in the middle of the hell of herald square , this is one of the better choices . located inside macy ' s , which , i know , makes it strange . however , it boasts its own express elevator which seems like a mini-oasis from the onslaught of every tourist that comes to nyc . working in the neighborhood , it ' s hard to find places that you can grab a drink with clients within a few blocks of the empire state building that supplies a good glass of wine and a decent cheese plate . we opted for this location the other day and it didn ' t disappoint . had the misto plate of N cheeses , split a pizza and a pasta . everything was wonderful . we sat at the bar as it was a casual catch-up and just wanted to a unwind after a chaotic day . i highly recommend it . 
always a hit with family . 
the food here is so good . i go all the time . if you want a good meal with friends and family this is the place to go . the more people you have the better , because the more dished you can try . the portions can feed about N people . the drinks are pricey but they are worth it . the only thing is that you have to make reservation especially if you have a big group going . this is a great place to go if you are seeing a show in time square . 
i use to call this " crack pizza " because it is addictive . i was going once , twice a week for awhile , and even now we go at least once a month . i lived in italy for a year and i ' m from nj , where we have lots of italian americans making top-notch pizza with family recipes from the homeland . this is one of the best pizzas i have ever had in my life . thin , thin crust , yummy chunks of tomato and perfect cheese . i ' m an athlete and i need carbs , but no one wants too many carbs - i have never gained weight from my frequent trips to delo ' s . we are all pretty greedy about our delorenzo pies in my family , usually we each eat more than a half pie . my boys go for pepperoni , i go for plain . for lunch i ' ll eat an entire " small " which is a few cm less in diameter than the large . other than pizza , there are delicious salads , the heirloom tomato being ridiculous . ( good ) . there is no dessert . it ' s byob . there is birch beer and other soda , by the glass or pitcher . i disagree with any reviewer who says the waiters have attitude or rush too much . there can be quite a wait to get a table , but everyone is agreed on it being worth it . go for lunch if you can , there is never a wait then . closed mondays i believe , and no lunch on weekends . 
the alfie ' s burger is excellent ! probably the best one i have had in the city so far . the service was slowish but it was just recently opened when we went . i will definitely go back for that burger . 
ok , so we wen ' t to see what ' s the bazz is all about . we got there at N N , we were told that we had to wait one hour , and we ' ll get a txt msg inviting us in . so we waited . and hour and a half later , we went inside to see what ' s up , still no room , so we waited another N minutes until the txt arrived . we thought - this must be good , otherwise people wouldn ' t wait so much to get in here . we got the butcher ' s steak and the veal . i mean , we ordered it , and it took N minutes to arrive ! again , we thought , this must be soo good . . and then we got it . and it was tasteless . we are both meat lovers , and we couldn ' t believe that this is what people are waiting for so much in line . . the only thing that was good was the desert . really good ! salty chocolate ice cream or something like that . really good . but not N hours of waiting good . the service is poor , the place is overpriced , over rated , and i ' m definitely not going there again . 
disappointing but i should have known better given the location . i am such a fan of lydia ' s and was expecting a better meal . it was just mediocre theater district tourist food . maybe a step up from olive garden but just barely . 
the food is above average . there are two dishes that i really like . one is eggplant roll . the other one is pickle fish filet . 
thoroughly enjoyed dinner at the restaurant . the food and service were great and the atmosphere was the perfect level of casual with a noise level that was acceptable given the location . the modern interior decor , elegant with high vaulted ceilings , great lighting , and comfortable seating was marvelous and made me a happy camper instantly . 
great affordable steaks . been here many times and they are generally spot on with steak or their baby back ribs which are to die for . waiters are nice . they start u off with fresh bread . side dishes are also stellar . u cant beat the price . also the manager is very nice and accomodating . nice comfortable booth seating . 
these guys know what they are doing . it almost is like you are invited into there kitchen and they prepare this amazing italian home cooked meal for N . N the bread is not good but the pasta is amazing ! try the soup . 
saxon parole is now at the top of my list for a chic and delicious night out in nyc . i went with my best friend and we felt like we were transported to another realm - we sat in the downstairs area - the setting was like being in a in an episode of boardwalk empire . the food was delish from beginning to end . i had an asparagus appetizer with yuzu and truffle that was literally the best thing i have eaten in a long time . oh , and the chocolate souffle - thank you ! i look for it everywhere i go . can ' t wait to go back ! 
while they have good pizza , this is montclair . everybody has good pizza , and there are several other brick ovens around . i go here because it ' s literally around the corner from my house , but never again . why ? because i just got hung up on . tonight is the second night that i have tried to get pizza from them--an entire half hour before they close--and their grill had already been shut down for the night . my boyfriend went to get it , so when he called to tell me this , i called ah ' pizz . i asked the person that answered what their hours were , and he reported exactly what yelp reports and what is stated outside their establishment door N pm ( sunday night ) . i said , " no , what are your actual hours ? my boyfriend just came in at N N and the grill was already turned off . " he said that , well , they close at N but they stop serving at N N . i replied that they should tell people this and have it clearly stated on their door . this is the second time this has happened to me . he had the nerve to laugh , say " yeah , okay , " and hang up . ( i should also mention that the time was now N N . when i asked about their hours , he just said that they close at N . i had plenty of time to run out and get a pizza based on that information , and he decided to not even tell me that the grill was already shut down for the night . ) clearly they don ' t care much about their customers . there are much better establishments to spend my hard-earned money at , thank you very much . 
beware of parking scams in this area . . . . . . . . i pulled into a lot across the street that advertised parking for N , little did i know it was N per N minutes ! ! ! ! even though i immediately pulled out i had to pay the N and that set the mood for most of the day . we ended up parking several blocks away at a meter that had an hour limit by the time we walked the distance to the market we could only stay about N minutes before we had to leave for the long walk back to the meter . from what we saw of the market it is a place we ' d love to further explore although the crowd was overwhelming . i truly believe if you cannot safely maneuver a stroller you shouldn ' t be in an area with such a concentrated crowd . come hungry ! we left in a mouthwatering state from the array of food smells but too long of lines to actually order anything . if anyone has any suggestions for parking on a budget and manageable distance i ' d love to hear about it ! 
attention ! non-chocolate food update ! yup . . . . that ' s right kids , they serve more than just whimsical cacao concoctions here . i wanted to write an update for max brenner because i tried more than hot chocolate this time . i had the chicken cobb sliders which were great ! cripsy fried chicken , lettuce , tomato , avocado , blue cheese , and some type of chipotle mayo i think . my sister had the max burger which was huge and looked delicious . a thick angus patty topped with cheddar , lettuce , tomato , huge onion rings , chipotle mayo and bbq sauce come on the side--mmmm . not sure it ' s quite worth the N price tag , but i ' m not a huge burger girl . . . so it just might be . those seasoned waffle fries are excellent too ! so on to the chocolately goodness me and baby sis split the melting chocolate truffle heart cake with the carmel heart . N stars for this dessert . it was good , but i was expecting oozing carmel to come out , and instead there was just a hollow hole - ( . there was a touch of carmel on top . . . but not enough for a " carmel heart " . also this dessert would be a lot better served warm . i will give the dessert N stars the N . presentation , N . the martini shaker filled with chocolate to use at your disposal N . the vanilla burbon ice cream with cripsy crepe flakes-crazy good . lastly , N stars for the kangaroo drink--a cappuccino ( a latte in my case-don ' t really like a lot of foam ) with two dark chocolate sticks was heavenly . i would come back just for that . i ' m not gonna lie . . . i came out of this place feeling quite sick . . . but a good sick . . . a chocolatey high type of sick . i think i would actually call out sick so i could get sick like this again . 
simply rock solid . group of N and we went family style w multiple plates of food . service from the waitress and the sommelier were spot on without being obtrusive . all the dishes were flavorful and thoroughly enjoyed by all . my personal favorites were the orchietta and the chicken . if the staff recommends chicken , you better bet it ' s good ! can ' t wait to try more dishes in the future . 
i agree . this was a big disappointment . not only the food but we were there on the night of the newtown shootings and there was a little man ( think he was the manager ) who wanted to change the channel to sports because the news was depressing his customers . unbelievable . 
if you ' re looking for great seafood this is the place to be . i am never disappointed when it comes to kyclades . the stuffed shrimp and lemon potatoes are melt in your mouth delicious . i can truly say that anything i have every ordered from here has always met my expectations . whenever i have friends in town i always chose to take them to taverna kyclades . everything is so fresh and clean and that is important when it comes to seafood . 
yes ! i actually love this place ! it ' s a super cute and trendy spot and their food is pretty good . i was feeling the puffs honesty because instead of just doing the traditional curry puff which i like they do one with cheese and other stuff that doesn ' t have the best taste in my opinion . everthing else ? pretty great ! i ' ve had the currys , fried rice , many if the appetizers and they never seem to disappoint . really great date spot as the ambiance is fabulous . i definitely recommend eating here ! 
sanford ' s is a consistently great restaurant . so many options on the menu and a wine and beer list that is always up to date and comparable if not better than what you would expect at a more fine dining spot . still open all night and they will soon be expanding into the lot next door . 
we were super disappointed . the service was less than friendly , and we felt like we were being rushed at times , it was really loud , we were sat with the sun in our face via a giant window with no shade , the food was horrible , and for the prices . overall can ' t say i was too impressed . they weren ' t packed or crazy busy so i ' m not sure why the service was so poor . 
i like the cheesesteaks here and i think it ' s okay but it ' s just to greasy and fat like most people in philly , and frankly the only thing philly is known for is cheesesteaks . i waited too long for an overpriced disappointment and other people shouldn ' t go through this , also the policy is kind of racist . honestly i think coming here was a mistake and i don ' t want to come here again . 
we enjoyed a nice meal on friday night . the introductory pricing is great ! noisy atmosphere , but good service and tasty food . lot ' s of menu options . lobster ravioli with basil cream sauce was delicious . filet mignon tender and perfectly cooked with fresh , flavorful sides . could use some more wine options . owner and staff present and concerned . nice to have a new place to go . try it ! 
just ate there for lunch today , the place was packed ( which is always a good sign ) . we sat at the sushi bar since there weren ' t any tables immediately available . we got the maki sushi lunch special . all the rolls were beautifully made and the fish was fresh tasting . my favorite roll so far is the yellow tail spicy roll . its a great spot for a work day lunch . service was fast and attentive . 
love the pizza , love the service , love everything ! ! ! ! 
heaven . delicious , fattening , crowded , italian heaven . i could live here . after i kicked everyone else out . i ' d move in . with my sleeping bag . and eat paninis and drink cappuccino all day , every day . and when i get sick of that , there are plenty of other options . i ' m movin in , pronto ! 
the chicken parmigiana sandwich is great . nice crispiness to the chicken and good sauce . 
calle ocho has been around for ages but unlike wine it does not age well with time . the menu consist of your typical selection of nuevo-latino cuban fair but i mean really , if the maduors are just okay ( dry ) , to me so is the restaurant . truth be told , the place looks inviting but looks are not enough in a place like manhattan , the food is simply put , okay . plus , let ' s face it , the service is pretty terrible ( if i want to wait that long for anything , i ' ll go to a theme park just ' cause it ' s nyc doesn ' t make it alright ) . i on the overall , throughout the years , have enjoyed my meals here ( been here twice both times dinner ) but it ' s not a place that ' s worth more than one visit , if that ( i can get okay cuban food for cheaper else where ) . my recommendation , don ' t waste your time money here unless it ' s the closest place but don ' t expect to be sitting or eating anytime soon , even with a reservation . 
had an amazing dinner here a few weeks ago . drank a pimms cup . i ' m a huge fan of pimms cocktails and this was no disappointment . pimms , gin , mint , cucumber and ginger ale , it was amazing here and worth the inspiration and trial at home . ordered the special appetizer , which was a crab cake . it was completely fresh , crisp on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside . also enjoyed the red snapper fish special , alaskan halibut with white anchovy vinagrette , a side of brussel sprouts ( which were " flaked " by leaves and not whole as i would have assumed ) . we finished with the chocolate banana bread pudding and loved every second of it . all in all , a fabulous meal . 
place was clean and modern . ramen was ehh and perhaps on the saltier side ( to be honest , i ' ve had better ) . rolls were smaller than average but fresh and tasty . steamed buns were amazing and sadly enough , the only highlight of our meal . if you don ' t mind spending a little for very average food and service in tribeca , this is the place for you . 
this was a pretty cool place for tacos . my husband and i came here for lunch today . the restaurant has really neat decor and a nice vibe . we ordered a variety of tacos , baja fish , pork belly , lamb and duck . they are small and tasty . we also ordered sides of chili-lime corn , coleslaw , and plantains . i did not like the plantains . everything came out on a dish that looks like the tray in your toaster . i didn ' t like eating off of a tray . there are N salsas on the table for you to try . the medium hot salsa was the best . the prices are pretty steep for tacos and sides , they should at least give you a side of tortilla chips . service was good , they came by often to ask how our food was . overall , decent place with ok food but the price is a little high . it might be a nice place to hang out when it ' s warmer so you can sit outside . 
i was taken to this place by my friend who is nyc native . when he described kati roll as " indian tacos " , my mouth already started watering . menu was quite simple . choice of beef , chicken and lamb and with without the egg . because of that , service is fairly quick . needless to say , meat was flavored with gorgeous indian spice ( curry ? tandori ? i couldn ' t tell . my indian spice pallet isn ' t sophisticated ) . portion is moderate . a big eater like me could ' ve ordered another one , but i refrained . it might get too heavy if i ' d had another one . i don ' t know why this indian street food is widely spread in all metropolitan cities in the us . i wish we have one in boston . and i hate to say this but . . . . new york city . . . . i concede my defeat . there ' s no way match up against thou . because you have kati shop but we don ' t . you are the blessed one . you are the chosen one . until the day we get a kati shop in boston , " yankees don ' t suck " . 
i absolutely love this place . amazing food , good service , amenable prices . easier to get i of you ' re dining alone . i love their noodles , some of the best i have found in the city thus far . 
fantastic crepes in an appropriately decorated little french bistro . tucked away on the stretch of havemeyer north of metropolitan , pates et traditions can be easily overlooked . you might notice some people reading the paper while drinking a coffee under nice yellow sun umbrellas inside a white iron gate - this is the place ! enter the shop , which looks part grocery store , part caf , and you are bound to be greeted by the owner or one of the friendly french waitresses . if you come alone , perhaps you ' d like to enjoy the outdoor area in the front , but as a couple or more , the seating inside is very pleasant . this review will only address the crepes as they are the only items that my companions or i have ever ordered . the savory selections have all been excellent , ham swiss , spinach , tomato mushroom - pick any and for the low price ( N ? ) you will not be disappointed . one order is certainly enough for a hearty meal , but if you are feeling adventurous , i ' d advise you to share a savory crepe , banana nutella perhaps , as a dessert . if you are looking for a beautiful local space that will transport you to the south of france , both in cuisine and d cor , please do yourself a favor and check this place out ! 
totally dive and we loved it . when at a new restaurant we always ask " what are you known for ? " we order the N items the waitress suggested -- fish taco , cuban sandwich and the corn . my husband and i split everything . more than enough food . best sandwich we have ever had . downside -- small and cramped . we ended up with a seat near the bathroom and my husband had to move his chair ever time someone needed to use the restroom . other than that --- fantastic nyc spot . 
my wife an i made reservations here to celebrate our N year anniversary . we both have never been here before and i decided to take a shot in the dark to suprise her with a romantic dinner here . i requested to be seated in their back dining area that looks like a library with a fire place . after looking at the pictures i was sold on the romantic type atmosphere of this area of the restaurant . i was not disappointed one bit ! my wife was extremely surprised and loved it . our waiter dan was awesome . he was extremely knowledgeable about what was on the menu and made many good recommendations on what to get . he recommended a great champagne which we decided to get a bottle of and also recommended their special for the night which was pork belly . i decided to get the pork belly and my wife gor the rotisserie chicken entr e . the pork belly was heavenly and had this melt in your mout goodness . my wife said she loved her entr e as well . we also had the ribs appetizer which was fall off the bone goodness . we topped it all off with the orange creamsicles for dessert . everything was wonderful ! i would highly recommend this spot for the most excellent service if not anything else . thank you for making this night special for the both of us . we will be back ! 
great steak . great sides . great eggplant app . 
pros great ambience food is spectacular service is great did i say the place was decked out and epic ? loungey lunch specials over the weekend yellow curry fried rice in an omelette cons tofu basil was not great . smelled fish like . i ' m saving the fifth star for consistency . if and when i come back more i will update . 
had dinner there a few nights ago . food and service were very ordinary . then to top it off , i looked at my bank statement and the restaurant had over-charged my card . i left the tip in cash , and they added it onto my card and charged me for it again . after i ' d signed the check . never going here again . they a terrible . 
damn fine burger ! 
the food was unique and delicious . the maitre d seemed to be having an off day but our waitress was helpful and friendly . we tried N appetizers - scallops in green curry , pork jowl with watermelon , and fried oysters . they were all flavorful and colorful , but the fried oysters were my favorite . we were worried the jowl would be fatty and heavy but the watermelon helped to balance it out and keep it refreshing . the drinks all had a summery asian spin which were unique as well . i look forward to going back . 
la va cafe is great little neighborhood cafe , and if i could i would give it N . N . the atmosphere is eclectic and comfortable . it is very nice to sit and sip on a hot beverage and read a book , or bring some work for an afternoon . it is a casual coffee shop that is warm and inviting , and it is great at providing that service , but don ' t expect table service and an upscale meal . my husband and i went for coffees and sandwiches last week , and both were good . i had the turkey panini and he had the chicken panini . honestly , they were not the most fantastic sandwiches we ' ve ever eaten , but they were good , and we were able to have a quick cheap meal in a relaxing atmosphere . it was a great way to recharge mid-day . we grabbed coffees to go , and they were delicioous . the service was friendly and prompt , and overall we really enjoyed our lunch . they do have a N credit card minimum , which is not ideal , but it wouldn ' t deter us from going back . 
this may be the worst burger place on the planet , beers good , staffs rude , burgers are terrible . buns horrible , meats low quality and the artisanal burgers on the menu are flavorless . 
we stopped by this pizza place a week ago in the evening . the service was great and pizza was delicious . this place could be called one of the best pizza places in nyc ! 
good place to go eat sushi . their selection is wide and they are fresh . 
very long lines long wait time ! ! ! but actually it went by quickly . . . it was about N mins waiting during the summer time . the pizza lives up to expectations . soooo darn good . no other is comparable . the pizza pie was actually pretty cheap , around N-N , i was expecting to pay more since its a tourist trap . it serves about N people ( N large slices ) , the only con i have is the oven is right by the tables , so it was very hot inside and the smoke and smell of the oven was over powering . they def . need to open the windows or vents . otherwise , this is a must try for everyone ! ! 
came here for a late dinner on a saturday evening . despite us making reservations , it took almost N minutes to get seated . we sat by the bar and had a drink , and it was nice that the hostess came over while we were waiting and apologized . it ' s a really small restaurant , but it ' s a nice date spot despite the lack of space ( the noise level is a bit loud though ) . drinks N ) poquito picante ( tanquery gin , jalapeno , cilantro , cucumber , cointreau liquer lemon juice ) refreshing with a nice kick . loved it . N ) dark n stormy ( gosling ' s black seal rum , ginger beer , lime juice ) my fiance enjoyed it appetizer N ) guacamole pretty fresh good entrees N ) tacos de pescado ( crispy tilapia baja style , jicama cabbage , chipotle slaw ) two bite sized fish tacos that were pretty good reminded me of san diego fish tacos ( not quite as good , but they were pretty good ) N ) lechon ( suckling pig , yucca puree , habanero mojo de ajo chicharron ) very good entree they gave us a dessert drink on the house ( i ' m assuming for the wait in the beginning ) which was an excellent move on their part , and we had appreciated the gesture . 
we came here one night specifically for the white truffle mushroom burger this fall during my crazed search for white truffles . this place did not disappoint . not only was i served a thick juicy burger with the aroma of white truffle wafting up at me but was also surprised by my choice of regular and sweet potato fries . i felt warm and cozy in the heavily wooded decor and soft lighting . we sat in the back of a hall next to the window and it still felt a bit like a lodge dinning room . the service was excellent , and prompt . we were in and out in an hour and enjoyed a glass of wine while we waited for our burgers . the fries , burgers , and special mayo made me feel as though i overindulged by a lot . oh well it was fantastic ! 
i used to frequent denny ' s quite a bit with my family . then one day i was seated at a table where you can see into the kitchen . i saw a waitress eat nachos from a nacho platter and then bring it to a table . . . . mine . i didn ' t say anything as to not cause a scene . we obviously didn ' t eat the nachos and we paid the bill but left no tip . we didn ' t return to that restaurant again . saturday , three years later , we decided to try denny ' s again . we figured there was sure to be a different wait staff and service might be better . we walked in and waited patiently while the host seated the couple in front of us . we were grateful for the fact that we had to wait because in that brief N minutes we waited , we realized the odor we started smelling wasn ' t food cooking . . it was mold and mildew . and the longer we stood there the worse the smell seemed to get . i am asthmatic and started wheezing . we walked out immediately . now for me to start wheezing after only about N minutes in the restaurant , the mold spores must have been very big and very old . this place needs to be reviewed by the health department . do not eat at the avenel , nj denny ' s on st . georges ave . 
sisig , khao soy , coconut rice all worthy dishes . swirling the raw egg in with the fried pork is kind of fun . only complaint is that the khao is at least moderately spicy and i wish they had a milder option as the sauce is delicious . the fried chicken is good , but there ' s about Nx more fried skin than chicken and i wasn ' t in the mood to just eat fried skin . only other mention is that they serve a lot of food . we shared N small plates and a side for N people and it was plenty ! eclectic group of cocktails with a low maintenance beer selection . beat expectations . 
the staff was very friendly , but the service was slow like described from other posts . ceviche mixto , mahi-mahi taquitos , and entra a were really good . but the mussels were super tiny like the size of pinky nail . even though the broth mussels were prepped in was good , i didn ' t even know such small mussels existed ! paella ' s flavor was good , but i think they overcooked their rice a bit b c it was a bit mushy . i ' ll go back , but skip paella and try bunch of other tapas . 
what an awesome restaurant ! the steak on stone ( i choose filet ) is amazing ( beware of wearing your sunday best there , you will smell like searing meat by the end of the meal ) . we also love the chilean sea bass as well as the shrimp in garlic and flaming chorizo appetizers . the complimentary salad to start is a nice touch . good wine list is reasonably priced . 
bread is great , but everything from pricing , portion and coffee sucks . the soup portion is ridiculous ( half of a small container ) , sandwiches are way to expensive and the coffee is horrible . 
the food used to be really good here . i don ' t know what happened , but the quality and taste isn ' t what it used to be . 
i ' d give it two or maybe even three stars if i were younger for its youthful ambiance . the decor is fun and the the staff look like they are enjoying themselves . but , for me it ' s just too loud and the food was ewwww . it feels like a good place to go with a big group for drinks if you don ' t really want to talk to one another , if that makes sense . the food is pan-latin american meaning the menu is way ambitious . i had a number of their empanadas and they were down right terrible . my husband ordered their arepas w cheese and wow , they were like flat pounded discs with a slab of melted cheese on top ? ? i was really confused . i don ' t know if the house has a specialty that could redeem this place in terms of food and i hate to say it but i don ' t think you could drag me there again . 
had the frech toast , grits , lower east side eggs benedict . all very tasty . waitstaff was nice and attentive . N stars b c i am cheap and i would have wanted the prices to be a bit less . 
i work nearby so i eat here almost every week . the " single " is plenty of food but if you skipped breakfast then get a " double " . i usually order the pork ( N ) with some fukuzinzuke but i ' ve also had the chicken . i ' ll try the " grand slam " some day but i might end up walking to bryant park for a nap instead of returning to work . 
i love this place . great food , good service and open all day . great spot for brunch or when it is nice out ( eat outside ) . always a crowd expect to wait for a table . 
a much needed breath of fresh air to the lower east side and slightly off the trendy grid . food is great , brunch is better . don ' t forget your cash , they don ' t take credit cards . 
i love burgers . and i wanted to love my plan b burger but i didn ' t . perhaps my expectations where too high ? i ' ve had better burgers almost everywhere else i ' ve been . the burger i ordered the bacon cheese burger , no pink with fancy fries . the burger arrived cooked incorrectly with a pile of cold caramelized onions on top of two of the thinnest bacon slices i have ever seen . when i looked at the patty i could see where the cook gripped the beef when they formed the patty and tossed it on the grill . i envisioned the cook grabbing a handful of beef , tossing it on the grill , heartlessly flipping it once then topping it with cheese , some sort of cheap bacon and some onions that had been sitting around . i couldn ' t even eat it . fancy fries not the type of fries i enjoy . thin tasteless potato twigs . so what did i like ? i loved my appetizer , american nachos . basically house made chips with cheese and toppings . great twist on nachos . service we had a good waiter . i don ' t send food back but if i said how disappointed i was with my meal i ' m sure they would have done something to make it better . the place gorgeous , great looking restaurant . overall i read many if not most of the reviews for this place . i ' m hoping that my experience was an anomaly . i would give this place one more try . maybe a cold beer would help . perhaps the cook was not working when i came in and a waiter cooked my meal ? vinnie out
the pizza is ok but one star for the pizzaiolos who definitely need to chill out . they serve you attitude for half an hour than they you get your slice . i ' ve been there N or N times and i noticed that they make you wait in purpose . they have like N pies of pizza ' s ready in the back , i mean cooked pizza ' s ready to serve ! ! ! but of course they want you to wait outside like an idiot so the whole avenue can notice the place . i felt like i was trying to get pizza in the soviet union during the N ' s . i ' m back to my old pizza lombardi
i ' ve been here so many times and i never had a chance to write a review . if i could , i would give num pang N stars ! ! this is a great little sandwich spot that holds a place in my heart ! haha their meatball sandwich is delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the carrots , cilantro , the sauce , delicious ! the lines are usually long , put its not a long wait . they ' ll take your order right away . there ' s not a lot of seating upstairs . the seating was never an issue because i took it to go . 
if you ' re craving authentic italian food , this is definitely the place to go . although they ' re pricey , its worth every bit . food is delicious and freshly made each time . you can also enjoy a good cigar while sitting around the table . waiters are very professional and they try to accomodate you in any way they can . its right off of route N west , not too far in the town . highly recommended . 
pretty good , though on a hot day you want to steer away from this place , but they do have cold noodle options , which are generally overrated , except on those hot days when you are craving ramen . they have a huge variety of different soup stocks and noodles , which is not traditionally how ramen is served . the ramen chef is supposed have a couple types of broth and one type of noodle , and he tells you what ' s good and you eat it . however , given this variety , sometimes you will pick the wrong type of noodle with the wrong type of broth , leading to sometimes non-optimal pairings . despite this , the ramen in general is very good . the place is not so big , but luckily it ' s not so well known so you won ' t have to wait for hours to get a seat like some other places , which may or may not be overrated , just sayin ' . 
ok , so i could not wait to try out amis . this was everything i thought it would be . its nothing less than what i would expect from one of vetri ' s heavenly spots . i loved every part of my meal , especially sal ' s meatballs ( sal is from what was told to me vetri ' s dad and its his actual recipe ) . my pasta course was the bucatini amatriciana and it was to die for . service was on key , and ambiance was perfect . 
if you looking for a very good restaurant , grants is the one ! i use to go to this place last five years and i was never disappointed . the service is above and beyond of what superlative service is . the wine list is very well selected . the food is to die for . from the fresh organic salmon to the homemade gnocchi ' s . the deserts are a perfect ending to a great meal . i would highly recommed this restaurant if you looking for a delicious food and outstanding service . 
due to surgery i have not been able to visit in person , but their delivery is awesome . by far the best delivery in the east windsor area , because it doesn ' t taste like " take-out " . . . it is clear they are using quality ingredients and everything is made fresh . so far we ' ve had the margarita pizza - fantastic , salad de jessica - insanely delish , alexs masterpiece and prime rib sandwich - both awesome . the only so-so dish we ' ve had was the fettuccine alfredo , but i think that was just be it ' s not a dish made for travel ( the chicken it ' s served with was very tasty ) . will continue ordering and definitely visit in person on e i am healed
came in here on a random day trip drive to princeton . no one else was in the restaurant but us , so it was pretty quiet . the waitress was very nice and peppy and came to check up on us during our meal . i had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries - the fries were so good ! the burger was good too , had a strong turkey taste , on a multigrain bun with avocado , lettuce , tomato , red onion and a pesto mayo i believe . boyfriend had the chicken sandwich with bacon , avocado , tomato , lettuce with french fries i had a bite and it was pretty good ! both sandwiches came with a pickle . good place to try in the princeton area . 
i guess i am a glutton for punishment . i ' ve been to plenty three times , and each time the service has been horrible . a friend from out of town went this morning , texting me how bad his service was , too . a run down first , the personnel are about as welcoming as wet rags . while i can ' t say anyone was actually rude , the vacant eyes and absolute indifference to the most basic niceties ( would eye contact or a smile really hurt ) would drain the good will reformation right out of ebenezer scrooge . there is a palpable sense that no one is quite as cool as the barista and , should you forget it or fail to see the obvious , you are being treated with a chilly , smug indifference to make the point unmistakable . second , after ordering a coffee and bagel with cream cheese ( same bagel every time , cream cheese N extra ! ) on three different occasions , i ' ve somehow managed to be charged three different prices . third , i had a coffee spill into the saucer , which caused a little mess i placed a napkin over the mess and drank the coffee . when i got a coffee refill , the clerk handed back my original saucer , soaked napkin and all . i don ' t know if the clerk was passively aggressive , completely unimaginative ( really ? it you have to be told to replace the saucer ? ) , or what , but i can ' t imagine that happening anywhere outside of the soviet union . all in all , the place should be avoided . there are too many good coffee shops in the neighborhood to waste your money supporting this place . 
princeton is a strange little town when it comes to restaurants . you ' d think for such a nice city with an ivy league school and tons of million dollar homes there ' d be an equal amount of high grade restaurants . but there just isn ' t any . and this average food is seriously over priced . my husband and i had N appetizer , an ice tea , and an entree each and the bill came to N tip . new york is cheap compared to this . the food was just average . the appetizer was mediocre and the entrees as good as any average american restaurant . not special at all . most importantly , we got a crab and spinach dip which turned out to have artichoke and almonds in it ! those two ingredients were not stated , it just said " crab and spinach " . if someone had allergies to artichoke or almonds , they ' d be in for a big surprise . i hate artichoke , so i would have never ordered it had they written it in the menu . bizarre . the fish was decent , selection was good , but again , just so so average , bland with no real distinction of flavor , no ingenuity , no culinary pride . but everyone seems to love this place . probably because there are no real options . disappointed with princeton restaurant scene . ps - reviewers who give this place N stars please go to any N or N star restaurant in nyc and then write your reviews . i think you haven ' t been out in a while . 
my friend took me to this place for lunch . a lot of people were waiting for seat but took N minute to get a seat . i really loved a hire-katsu whith is my friend recommend . thank you my friend ! ! i will try to eat a udon-noodle next time . 
accept no imitation . . . . . this is the best ny style pizza , or pizza for that matter . dominic is a master . there is a reason he only lets his sons grate cheese . well worth the wait . 
the food here is great , the portions are generous , and the prices are really reasonable . my only complaint is that it is so offensively loud at dinnertime ( and packed ) that it ' s really not worth the trouble . there are plenty of other thai places in the neighborhood to eat in , so i would recommend ordering joya for delivery or pickup only . 
definitely one of the best chin restaurants in ct ! 
in the spot of the long-lamented pif , a new country french byo has emerged . the decor has not changed much , the addition of a few ikea curtains and a fresh layer of paint , but that is part of the charm of this tiny eatery , and its forlorn location at Nth and washington , just outside the italian market . the food is impeccable , although it may strain the patience of the red-gravy crowd in philly . with head cheese , pigs feet , and such offerings on the menu , it is a very traditional french joint , which is a rarity in this town . 
i waited N minutes for a seat here and was told it would be worth it . it was . just the best ramen i ' ve ever had . i ' m no connoisseur , but damn . . . so rich and flavorful ! i just wanted to put a straw in the broth and drown my worries in it . and i can ' t even begin to describe the pork buns . . . wow ! it would have been better to experience it with my fianc though . such greatness is best shared . 
yale pop up cafe is on point this semester . check it out sundays N-N before it vanishes ! dirty chai is off-menu but highly recommended . 
everything was delicious and i tried several things , the quail , duck , shrimp dumplings , pork belly , kobe fried rice , pad thai , everything was flavorful , couldnt complain , however , we went as a group of N and the serving sizes were so small we had to order at least N of everything for everyone to get a small taste , ended up ordering entree sizes for each of us and some of those were even small . probably better for a date but i ' d never go with a group again . also they have interesting movie quotes playing in the bathroom . 
i decided to take my girlfriend to a nice restaurant around gramercy park - union square , since we got tired already from the bobby ' s mesa grill we were looking for something new , even thought its not a new restaurant it was new to us , especially the price range this range restaurant is in . . . we had a great time , service was excellent and food was amazing ! we will definitely go back . . . . 
delicious farm to table food in a comfortable setting inside the chelsea market . get the sausage with lentils . nom nom . 
came with a friend for lunch . we both got the lunch special N rolls and miso soup for N . N . . . a great deal ! ! the miso soup was delicious . i got a shrimp tempura roll and a california roll . the shrimp tempura roll was excellent . the california roll , however , was not that great . it was pretty much all cucumber , with barely any crab or avocado . the service was fantastic . the waiter was very friendly . the drinks and soup were brought out almost immediately after ordering and the sushi was made and brought out within just a few minutes . the waiter checked on us a couple of times . we also ordered a roll for take-out and the waiter did not forgot to bring out the roll with the check which i was very happy about . the restaurant is small but very clean . the only thing is when you walk in , there is no sign saying whether it is self-seating or " wait to be seated " but the waiter was very attentive , greeted us as soon as we came in , and told us we could sit wherever we could like . so although it was not a problem , it might be during busy hours for those who are eating here for the first time . i will definitely be going back for the lunch special ! ! ! ! 
grand buffet is the best chinese buffet in the state of vermont ! they have huge selections , food is always hot and fresh , staff are very friendly , definitely worth the money ! i
the moroccan eggs were dreamy ! there is a terrific service , food and ambiance at this charming little spot . there is an enclosed back patio that is full of plants and daylight . a great brunch option . i will have to go back and check out their evening menu . 
french fries are my comfort food . . . so a restaurant devoted only to them- yes please ! even if i am a meat and potato kind of girl , i am happy to let fried potatos take centre stage and full plate for special occasions . and pomme frites is a great place to do that . the frites are just the right amount of crispy . and while i might like my frites a bit thinner ( in a perfect world ) , these aren ' t too thick so ill be goldilocks and say that these are just right for the deal . the massive array of sauces ( some mayo based , which aren ' t my thing some ranch based- now we are talking . . . ) are impressive and delicious . the location makes it a great place to stop in when you had to skip lunch at work but are on your way to a drink and need to have a bit of reserve to sop up the alcohol you are about to imbibe . it is also a great place to hit after you hit the buzz and are searching for a little bit of grease . 
great food and wonderful service . the waitress recommend a great beer that just came in that day ! she was on top of her game ! 
brother ' s is the usual pizza place for my household . we usually get a large pepperoni sicilian pie , which can feed an army and last for days . while their thin pies are okay ( one pie about N years ago made me violently ill so i avoid their thin pies ) , i think their sicilian pies are much better . the inside of the restaurant is pretty dumpy so we prefer ordering take out . our take-out orders have always been ready in N minutes even on a friday or saturday night . if you do go on a friday or saturday , be prepared to wait . the thing that bothers me the most is the prices . each item is about N-N more than it ' s worth what you get on the plate . for example , the meatball parm sandwich is N . N and you get N small meatballs on a large roll . it ' s a total ripoff . and all of pasta dishes are way overpriced considering the quality and quantity . if there ' s a silver lining , it ' s that they often offer coupons in some of the local newspapers and coupon flyers . 
all the rage in bayonne . excellent food . i love this place . 
the bessssttt place to get any type of croissant in the city hands down . i ' ve been to so many bakeries up down and around town and this bakery used to reside right across the street from my place . luckily it has only moved a couple blocks down . if i ' m early and luck enough i ' ll get one of their breakfast croissants which are out of this world so delicious . no other breakfast sandwich compares . i indulge in the buttery flaky goodness each and every croissant has to offer . their almond croissant is my number N go to . i love everything about this family owned patisserie . the most genuine friendly gem in my book
mercato is a great deal with tons of choices during restaurant week . dinner for two on a packed friday evening went just at the right speed , and the server was attentive without being pushy . the antipasto had excellent variety and was huge , with lots of strong flavors . the scallop entree looked dainty but was pretty good . i prefer the big , puffy scallops to the small ones they serve here . my date ' s filet was great ! dessert was the hardest choice , but i settled on a not-too-sweet panna cotta , which ended up being the highlight of my meal . i know it ' s not a complex food , but the flavors were classic and just right . it ' s not their fault the place is so small . great service and good food put mercato on my revisit list . 
the best coffee . there ' s just something about it ! ! ! so delicious . i also love their jam filled croissants ! 
we had dinner at walia for the first time tonight , and we already are talking about when we can go back . the place was spotlessly clean , the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable , and the food was excellent . we ' ll recommend this place to anyone . 
so i went here one day last week around N , submitted our order shortly before N from the lunch menu that the waitress provided . when we finished she gave me my bill it was N . N . i ordered the chowder pot platter with calamari which was N . N and had N glasses of la villa pino grigio N . N each . because she had rung me out after N N i was charged dinner prices on my meal which was N . N . they need to advertise there change from lunch to dinner clearly somewhere . this place is a leech . 
c ' est un tr s bon restaurant de greenwich village , moins d contract et jeune que le risotteria , mais les plats sont vraiment tr s bon et rel vent plus de la gastronomie ( faible portion mais merveilleuse qualit ) . je recommande ce restaurant pour les amateurs de plats fins italiens pour une client le un peu plus l gante . le d ner au bar reste toutefois assez diff rent et sympathique . 
johnny brendas it the best bar and venue fishtown and most of philly has to offer . i love this place . the food is awesome . they have a super attractive and friendly wait staff . . . melanie is awesome ask for her . the beer is all local and tasty , and the food although takes a while at times is great , and usually worth the wait . go on a weekeday the weekends are a bit crowded . 
good food ! good friendly service ! great first impression on my family and myself when we went to eat there . there mac cheese is to die for a must try ! ! ! 
this place is sooo good ! tacos out of this world . 
this is a solid place to meet up with a friend but it ' s definitely not pizza to go home and rave about . the pizza is like a new york slice made a bit fancy . i enjoyed the calamari . they were tender and not overcooked . i also appreciated the wine list . it had bottles at all price ranges , which is nice when you want to have a cheap night out . i will definitely go back , but if i am in the mood for some awesome pizza , i will head over to motorino . 
head and shoulder above any other joint in long island city . i would go to lic market over m wells any day . this is the real thing organic fresh ingredients , perfectly prepared , and at very reasonable prices . we have tried a lot of dishes ( brunch , lunch , dinner ) and have never been disappointed . service is good too . a word of caution they live off the citi bank crowd , so it is hard to get a table between N N and Npm when the business suit hordes come down . 
the portions are huge and the food is friggin fantastic ! 
good pizza , late hours , they delivery tobacco products . 
i ' ve been to this place more times than i can count . every single time , the food was great and really clean-tasting . i chided my boyfriend for choosing general tso ' s chicken at a place where you can get salt-baked frog , but he said it was hands-down the best chinese food he ' s ever had . if it wasn ' t for my last visit , they would ' ve gotten the full N stars but recently , the service has been inconsistent . we came in at N or Nam and the place was packed ( no surprise there ) but unlike my previous visits , i ' ve never been so ignored by restaurant staff in my life . is there favoritism in this place for chinese people ? absolutely . my boyfriend and i sat for N minutes before anyone even acknowledged us - they only did after i finally flagged down one of the servers . they rushed us through our order and never came back to check on us or ask if we want anything else . the group of chinese college kids who came in after us were pretty much getting their food when he and i were starting to order . i ' m sure they would ' ve been sat before us had i not said something . fucking ridiculous . i ' m pretty confident we were so invisible to the staff that we could ' ve just walked out without paying and nobody would ' ve noticed . despite the great food , that ' s the kind of shitty service that makes even the most loyal patron consider never coming back . 
Nrd stop on our top N cheesesteaks of philly mission . ive been here many times . this was my Nst ever cheesesteak experience along with pat ' s . i tend to usually pick genos so i already knew what to expect here . as with all cheesesteak places expect a line . they are also cash only . i still like this place a lot . they make a good cheesesteak but at least now i know i have other options . if you ' ve never had obe i would say give this ace a try . they are ontbe top N . 
this is my all time fav in princeton area . every saturday this place is packed with local asians and people who know this place is good . their food is authentic good chinese food . the price is also fair . unlike other places where they blindly increase price of dishes over the years and lose sight of the quality of their dishes . for those that appreciate good food this is where you want to go . 
wafa ' s is the benchmark for lebanese food in nyc . this is the real deal and a must go to for anyone with a true appreciation and knowledge of how it ' s done right . kudos to you wafa- you have hit a home run with your absolutely authentic lebanese food . it does not get any better than this from one of very few true lebanese culinary purists . 
i really like this place , they do my hometown speciality the socca ! and it is quite good ! the first time i went there , the owner spent some time with is us and we talked about france . she even offered dessert ! i go there when i ' m homesick but it ' s a great place to discover mediterranean specialities . 
tender lovin grill is one of the best lunch spots in hillsborough . they have great weekly specials ranging from various chicken to lobster dishes . very friendly staff and the food is always excellent . 
top notch pizza . 
i have been enjoying lunch and dinner here for about N years . the clams and mussels in white have always been superb . once they came out lukewarm i called my waiter who returned with a fresh bowl piping hot and comp ' d my date and my appetitizers . the salmon is to die for . a nice portioned salmon steak . served with spinach which i hate but cant get enough of when eating here . and the desserts are just as good . from the mista salad to the fra diavlo pasta this reteraunt is every italian food lovers dream . and it doesn ' t hurt that you can watch the game on one of the several televisions
nice place . good food . visited there after my trip webster hall . had a decent meal . 
i ' d wanted to impress a business associate mentor , who loves japanese cuisine , so i yelped and googled and trip advisored my little heart out looking for just the right place . this came up over and over again . the night we went was super busy , but the service withstood it . the food is supremely excellent . i ' ve since been back many times , mostly . . . 
really love this place . the service is excellent - friendly and attentive - the music is great , and the food is fresh and so good . my favorite is the gluten-free belly warmer mob with yucca fries . the ketchup has honey in it and it is yummy . one of my favorite places . portions are very generous too . 
over rated food and underwhelming service . the only outstanding dish was the ground meat sausage seasoned with cumin . . . fried zucchini was not bad either . but i have had a much homelier and richer tasting greek food for much cheaper ( greek corner in boston for example ) . the worst part was having to lift our plates from the table every time there was a changeover because the seatings are so uncomfortably crammed ! completely takes away from the beautiful and serene ambiance of this place . save your money for a better tasting meal and experience . . 
went at N N on a friday night , seated right away . the room was filled , but there were N tables open . it was loud from the moment we walked in . but the decor is nice and homey . one big room for dining on the right . on the left side is more casual . waitress was great . arugula and walnut salad very good . margarita pizza good , very tasty crust . N for N salads , pizza and tip . byob . 
the beef was amazing , the floor was very clean and the people where very friendly
best beer selection in new haven by far . the place is very large and can get pretty busy on the weekends . i feel like cask has an identity crisis when it comes to the food . i ' m not sure how to categorize it . weird turkey burgers on english muffins , ahi tuna , and oyster sliders round out the odd menu . with that said , it ' s all pretty good . burgers are a bit overcooked every time but all the beer makes up for that . nice place , spend some time reading the beer menu because it ' s extensive . 
yum ! go here for the sushi . it has very little rice - just one layer on top of the seaweed and is very large and filling . the only special roll i got was the iron man roll which is highly recommended - banana tempura . . . mmmm . . . . it was massive and required N bites . the waitresses were very friendly and quick to refill water and bring the check . 
average sportsbar you find in jersey . went last night to catch nfl games . it looked like there was only one waitress on hand for so many tables . she was not on point hard to catch many times throughout the night but she was friendly . very few options for me being a vegetarian . everyone ' s food from wings , sandwiches , app platter , and mozz sticks were eh nothing to rave about . but there was a nice selection of beers . we had two towers and a few more drinks . lots of televisions all over the place . it got loud having all of the theatrics and the announcer . paid a little more than i expected to at the end of the night for four N 
just tried the atlantic- salmon fresh salsa lettuce tomato in a roll , toasted . incredible- the salmon was cooked just right , and the flavors worked perfectly together . can ' t wait to try the lebanon , which the guy working there also recommended . 
went for girls brunch and was pleasantly surprised . good prices , interesting but not specifically thai inspired decor- the chandelier in the middle of the room is the big elephant in the room . staff were lovely and food was just fine and best of all they dont rush you when all u want to do is catch up with your friends . 
so i ' m from california and i found it absolutely necessary to write a review on this fantastic place . about two years ago the family and i took a trip to new york for vacation . we went to all of the tourist attractions and even ate at a few places in the " little italy " but nothing i have ever tried here or there compared to the food at lombardi ' s . i can ' t speak for everything on the menu , but i can say that the pizza i ordered was heaven for my taste buds . the pizza is crispy throughout and has an artisan , good quality taste to it . the pizza is very moist and flavorful and all i cn say is that it is no ordinary pizza ( i ' m used to pizza hut and little caesars pizza ) . so for this review i am giving N stars for the best pizza i have ever eaten up to date . -side note the place has a million pictures of who i assume to be the owner and its a little weird . 
been going her since i was a kid , now i take my kids . good food , fair prices . one of the old time lake hiawatha landmarks , hope gus lives forever ) 
been coming here for the past N years . always get the " mixed with everything " ( chicken lamb rice lettuce ) . extra white sauce ! gotta be careful with the hot sauce , cause it ' s really spicy . i remember when a platter was just N , but the price increase never really bothered me . the only thing that did bother me is when they stopped including tomatoes with the lettuce . that was years ago , but tomatoes compliment that dish well . still though , this is great stuff , and i sometimes order N , so i can have one for lunch the next day . fat ! 
came here a couple of weekends ago for my sister ' s Nth birthday . i was worried i would struggle getting a table for N on a saturday night in manhattan ( and i did ) , but bouley managed to squeeze us in at N N - not too late a sitting when you ' ve got an awesome cocktail bar down the road ( brandy library - amazing ! ) . staff was incredible , gorgeous cocktails and wine , and the food was beyond superb ! best meal i ' ve had in perhaps ever ! will be going back again for my birthday ! 
it takes some serious slacking to eff-up garlic bread , especially when you ' re an italian restaurant . my boyfriend and i tried this place because we wanted an easy , casual , go-to italian restaurant . not really what you would call high expectations , right ? you ' d think it would be harder to disappoint than to deliver , right ? well congratulations to papa frank ' s for being crappy on all fronts . decor dusty , dirty , grungy , cheap , uncomfortable service incredibly bad , slow , absent , waited N minutes after being seated before seeking out a waitress , and it got worse from there food bland , weak , beyond unimpressive . literally i can make better italian food with a box of dry pasta and a jar of prego . and the worst garlic bread i ' ve ever had . 
good cheap food and big portions are what i ' m all about ! 
my husband and i really loved this restaurant ! ! the ambiance was cozy , fun bar scene , good drinks and the food was amazing . we just ordered a bunch of different starters and split everything was loved it all . scallops , crab on toast , butternut squash salad and the potato ' s . all so yummy ! ! we would definitely go back . 
while i thoroughly love lucy ' s food which is absolutely delicious , the service is awful and the staff has no common courtesy . i had asked a wrap to made into a sandwich to be made into a wrap , which seems easy enough . however after being told it was possible , a second staff member rudely remarked that they couldn ' t do that . i had been there every day for lunch for N days straight and now i will not be going back for a while . 
lovely place in williamsburg . have been here twice now , both times for dinner , and it really doesnt disappoint . feels very homey inside , but during the warmer days , id recommend trying to get a table outside - it may be a bit cramped , but it feels like your own little private courtyard . the food feels , while trying to be south american , more new american . from the regular menu , the octopus white bean cassoulet are probably one of the best things you will ever have . the filet mignon sandwich feels rustic , and is really comfort food at its finest . do dedicate an outing to w-burg to visit this bit of nirvana
the seemingly secret location and tavern atmosphere make freeman ' s a unique spot for a special occasion . if you ' re going for dinner , start with the artichoke dip , scallops for the main course and bananas foster for dessert . you won ' t be disappointed . 
my boyfriend and i are just finishing our dinners here now . we beat the dinner menu by about N minutes , so there was a shorter menu , which was immediately pointed out to us when we entered . we were offered bar seating if we wished to wait , but the short menu looked good , so we didn ' t want to wait . we got both seating near the front , inside ( the place is semi-small , but also had garden seating in the back ) . i was between two two whiskey drinks from their menu and our waiter suggested the second of my choices - the gold rush . good suggestion ! i really liked it . if you like whiskey and lemon , then this is a good choice for you too . i ordered the spicy tuna burger and my bf ordered the french dip . we both loved our meals . both came with a decently large portion of slim fries . really tasty and worth the cost . a great little hidden gem in williamsburg - a short jaunt from the brooklyn brewery , the water , and the williamsburg bridge ( connects brooklyn to manhattan ) . 
wow ! ! phenomenal tapas sangria ! ! love that this place is great for groups and takes reservations . came here friday night for a birthday dinner and just fell in love with the food . we were party of six and practically ordered almost the entire menu list . top favorites were the mejillones avoa , croquetas de pollo , and bacalao frito . we lost count how many pitchers of sangria we had - it was simply refreshing and delicious ! service and our waiter were friendly , attentive , so accommodating . thank you for a fabulous dining experience . definitely welcomes you back and i will be back ! 
we went as a group of about N women and were served in a private room , considering that we were a boisterous crowd , the service was excellent and the food superb . i can highly recommend this restaurant and i plan to go back there very soon . mary
amazing food and very friendly service . so far , it ' s byob . only problem is it ' s hard to cut the food in the little baskets and with only a fork and butter knife . but it ' s a small price to pay for the deliciousness of the arepas ! 
the best pasta dishes ever
one of my favorite restaurants in philly . here ' s what we had arugula salad with serrano ham and fried goat cheese balls- pleasant but not out of this world . wagyu carpaccio with pickled shallots - very tasty but could have used more shallots as a condiment . truffled chestnut soup with duck confit and quail egg - there should be a note on the menu that says you must order this . it ' s heaven in a bowl and alone makes it worth a trip to tinto . it ' s rich enough to share a bowl if you can part with it . it ' s slightly sweet from the chestnut , creamy and the truffle just adds an amazing flavor organic chicken with sauteed greens , mushrooms , pine nuts and currants - the tiniest cutest little chicken . delicious and the accompanying veggies were delicious green beans with dates ( i forget if it was dates or figs ) and some nuts and paprika - least favorite dish of the night . i love vegetables but this concept needed a bit more work . baby artichokes with homemade pappardelle - another home run . fresh , and light but rich at the same time , hint of truffles . highly recommend potatoes with some tomato sauce and la peral blue cheese sauce . think maybe the taters were poached in olive oil . nice to round out the meal . we also tried a nice rosado wine , a crisp verdejo and a spicy garnacha , all were available by the glass and complemented the food well . the price does add up , but i think that food prepared this well justifies the price . i ' d go back just to sit at the bar , have a glass of wine and some chestnut soup . 
this is a cute and quirky place with an admirable concept , but i can ' t get full on cute , quirky , and admirable . plus , the prices are not justified . i ordered the kimchi burger because it sounded yummy . no . the meat was so dry i thought i was eating jerky . there is also no kimchi -- maybe they just forgot to put it in ? the sauce was also oddly sweet . i don ' t mind sweet sauce . i just don ' t think it paired well with the kimchi burger . i also got the lemon-grilled asparagus because i ' m a sucker for asparagus . ( they look funny , they taste great , and they ' re good for you . ) the asparagus ends were charred beyond recognition . i was eating charcoal until i got to the dried out middle . on the plus side , had they not charred the asparagus , i would ' ve enjoyed it because they use tender baby asparagus . also , it ' s true what the other reviews say . noise level is incredible . i couldn ' t hear myself think and i walked out of the restaurant with a ringing in my ear . 
these guys make great falafel ! whenever i ' m in the area i almost make it a point to go here . and the falafel sandwiches are only N . N ! love this place ! it gets pretty busy and packed though , but they are super quick to make your order . ) 
can ' t get to philly for a good ol philly cheesteak check out shortys ! sooo good i usually get the old fashioned cheesesteak which is very good . i would also suggesting getting the bacon cheese fries or the chili cheese fries very good and the fries are awesome ive been to the location in times square just as good as well ! 
the owner must of had the day off , requested table of N N Npm and was told " sorry we ' re closed " last time i checked N N isn ' t Npm . 
i was really looking forward to trying jamonera based solely on the fact that marcie and valerie are culinary geniuses and incredible business women . we decided to dine here because my roommate and i were looking just to go out to eat and get appetizers . tapas ( small plates to share ) , what a great idea instead of the standard crappy apps you can find at other restaurants ! our overall dining experience was great from start to finish . our waiter was attentive and was constantly circling around to see if we wanted to order more tapas . olives to start were a nice touch- very fresh and salty , just the way they should be . we ordered the tortilla espanola , the mushroom coca and the crab manchego croquettes . everything was wonderful- the mushroom flatbread stole the show with its salty cheese and sweet honey . if it wasn ' t for the price , i would go back to this restaurant . my roommate and i shared these tapas and my bill with tip still came to about N- i didn ' t even have any wine ( maybe i should have to ease myself when the bill came ) . for the amount i spent on food , i shouldn ' t have walked away from the restaurant still hungry . you can go to other high end restaurants around Nth street and walk away N poorer and have something to show for it . 
food is good ( truffled cheesesteak empanadas . . only in philly ) and you get the love and affection of cute dogs looking at you without the accompanying slobber ( but maybe the smell ) . i really like the atmosphere of this place and its N floors have pretty much anything you want- if you want to be kind of cramped and have pictures of dogs looking longingly at you . 
the place took my girlfriend to skara estiatorio for dinner saturday night at N N . the place was about full when we arrived . we were greeted with a smile and asked if we would like to check our coats . we were seated at a table near the front . the place isn ' t large , but we certainly didn ' t feel like we were on top of the next table . in a shocking development , they actually had salt and pepper shakers on the table ! ! lately it seems that every restaurant we go to we have to ask for them . oh , and the salt was " himalayan sea salt " . . . in case you ' re into that . the place was well lit ( we could read the menus without the help of a flashlight app ) , clean and while i wouldn ' t consider it an overly romantic spot , it wasn ' t very noisy either . the staff our server was andrea . she was extremely helpful , friendly , knowledgeable and apparently tried every item on the menu . it ' s important that we don ' t feel rushed , as reviewing the menu items can take us about an hour . . . . . at any rate , we never felt rushed and by the time we got around to ordering our main course ( it ' s a byob , by the way ) , the place had pretty much filled up . the owner came over to our table on more than one occasion during dinner and seemed genuinely interested in our experience . great guy , super nice . the food we ordered two appetizers - the skara eggplant and the wrapped feta . the eggplant was a bit bland , but still tasted good . the wrapped feta was outstanding . for our main course , we both ordered one of the specials . we ordered the moshari stifado - ( braised beef ) and the lamb shank lemonato which is severed over potatoes . both were delicious and tender . the portion size was more than adequate . the moshari stifado was large enough to allow half to be taken home . for dessert our server recommended the eck-mek . . . it ' s like a firm custard with whipped cream ( homemade of course ) , over a unique crust that i really can ' t explain . it was covered with caramel . fantastic ! ! highly recommend it . in summary , i highly recommend skara estiatorio and will definitely go again . 
i always give good review whenever a restaurant is boyb . they have pitchers of mojito and sangria you can mix your wine with . great idea . this is definitely a young crowd since theres plenty of outdoor seatings just an overall loud atmosphere . the braised beef is good and it came in large portions . everything else ( chicken , ropa vieja , steak ) was ok . parking is not so bad but this isn ' t manhattan so i don ' t expect to walk a few blocks . the food is not very authentic but still decent . 
deli sandwich ready to be made . 
great spot when your looking to save some money and have a couple of cheap ( but effective ) drinks . this is actually my go to spot when i ' m in the area . the viagra empinada is a must ! 
while inordinately small , this place is one of my favorite sushi spots in philadelphia . their ookie eel , yakuza , pachinko , medusa , and triple spicy double tuna rolls are incredible ! the service is consistently great and the ambience is trendy ( in a good way ) . i definitely recommend this to any sushi fans in the city , especially to anyone who lives nearby in the fairmount area . 
we did not receive a warm welcome upon arrival . small , expensive , crappy plates that were so salty it was difficult to choke down . never again . 
the most impressive and best dining experience i have had in a long time . should have gotten N stars from the times . everything was incredible -- and they did the whole thing vegetarian for me . outstanding . anyone who doesn ' t like it , doesn ' t get it . experience . 
i haven ' t been here in years , but it was a staple in my high school diet ! ! at least once a week we would make the trek from lyndhurst high over to clifton for these delicious dogs ! ! deep fried hot dog w cheese and cheese fries . . . could you ask for anything better than that ? ? seriously ! ! every time i visit nj , i always say i ' m gonna stop , but we can never find the time , but i plan to make it a point on my next visit ( probably in may ) to go here so my husband can taste this deliciousness first hand ! 
my first sushi experience was at mr . sushi , back in N ( when they were still in a little spot next to shoprite in lincoln park ) . i was in love . the lunch specials were incredibly inexpensive and the all you can eat special for N was unbeatable . yes , the service was sometimes downright rude . however , at other times the husband would come out and throw us some little bonus salads and teasers . either way , i never let my feelings get in the way of an amazing value . i ' ve moved to two major cities in the past two years and i have never found another sushi restaurant that comes close to mr . sushi . i make my pilgrimage back each time i come home . seems like other reviewers have a problem with the wait time . i would rather wait an hour to have a plate full of artfully prepared made-to-order specialty rolls than go to a restaurant where they fling sloppily made low-grade sushi onto a conveyer belt ( yes , this is real ) . do yourself a favor if you ' re starving , go get fast food . if you want to experience a delicious , quality meal without breaking the bank grab a bottle ( or two ) of wine , a few good friends and head to mr . sushi for a relaxing evening of good conversation and sushi you will dream about . ( err . . . maybe that ' s just me ) it really is one of the best out there . believe me . i ' m looking . 
absolutely hands down the best pizza in manhattan . it ' s difficult to find authentic italian pizza in nyc , but luzzo ' s has it ! . the buffalo pizza is outstanding ! highly recommend luzzo ' s . 
i ' ve only been here three times , but every time i was the only customer . i ' m not sure if that ' s good or bad , but service was very good lol . i usually order their gyro , fried eggplant and greek fries . the gyro is always stuffed with all the goods . i always want more of the fried eggplant when i ' m through . but the fries are just mediocre . this place is a little pricey compared to other greek places in the area , but it ' s worth it . 
update ! had lunch with a friend in the new location last week and it was great ! both the woman who seated us and our server were very friendly . the new location is spacious and i didn ' t feel in the way ! 
my friend and i went here a couple weeks ago and the food was amazing . i want to go back and try their different udons and ramens . if you go make sure to try their pork buns it is so so so good ! the only thing i didn ' t like about this place is that the workers kept staring at me and my friend . although attentive service is more than welcome i felt really scrutinized while eating so despite the yummy food i was slightly uncomfortable . my friend also agreed with me
potato eggs is amazing there . . . also try the eggplant . defonte ' s is one of my favorites . must try ! 
my husband ate here last week and loved it ! the food was simply delicious and satisfying . quail was like nothing we have ever tasted . i had the risotto and he had the hanger steak , both perfect ! the only negative was a draft from the window . once i told the waiter he used a towel to block the draft . list is great too . parking is tough but that is par for the course here . 
well i must warn as many as i can ! ! ! i had my birthday party at zinc and the food was ok but the staff was " ok " not really on point . the worse thing of all was the face that my bill was N . N but when i checked my account N days later they had charged an additional N . N to my account for no reason at all . they had no right to do this . i am fighting it now with them and they hang up on my and lie elizebeth and donna the owner know they are in the wrong but they lie and lie ! this is such a wrong thing to do to a person . and from what i hear i am not the first one they have done this to . please if you plan to eat there and you should not , take cash ! ! and be preped to deal with the bottom of the barrel . there are so many other great places in new haven to eat . 
i have been going to song for a couple of years now and to date have not had a bad experience . the food is consistently delicious and the staff is very attentive . . especially for re-filling your water . the pad see-yue , fried calamari and tiger shrimp rolls are my favorite . the prices are very cheap which is an added plus to a great place ! ! 
we had seafood on a monday night , what a mistake ! the risotto seafood was watery and tasteless . the zuppa do pesia was equally awful , the squid was mushy and tasteless , it must have been at least N days old , absolutely disgusting . i would not recommend this place under any circumstances , i can ' t understand how anyone would give this place any rating above N . 
tartine stands at the forefront of nyc brunch scene . their prix fixed N brunch menu offer a great selection of brunch classics , such as eggs benedict , omlette , etc . the pastries at this place is also delicious . i love their almond croissant . tartine doesn ' t take reservations , and it ' s cash only ( who doesn ' t take cards nowadays ? ? ) . otherwise , i ' d give them a N star . 
last week was our first time dinning at cafe triskell . it was amazing there was an older lady serving us . me and my boyfriend loved it and we went back today . today , the food was good but surprisingly the service was just awful . it was a different server , her name was cindy and from the beginning she was rude . i understood that they were busy but we waited quite a bit . i raised my hand and said we are ready to order , which was fine . the problem started when i asked her a question . the brunch menu comes with coffee so i asked her " does ice coffee come with the brunch or is it just hot coffee ? " she responded with a really annoyed tone " i ' ve already told you that ice coffee is three dollars . " which she did not tell me . she told us that they have " refreshing lemon aid and ice tea for three dollars . " i told her she did not mention the iced coffee and she didn ' t even say sorry . then she goes on and said it nice and s low , enunciating every word for me " lemon aid , iced tea , and iced coffees are three dollars ma ' am . " when the food came she didn ' t even bother to put it in front of me . when our food came it wasn ' t even busy maybe five tables . i wasn ' t going to be picky with that . but looking at how she was attentive to the other tables was what made me realized that we are getting really different treatment . she also didn ' t bring out our coffees until we asked a different server . after we finished our food we just waited for her as she passed by us five times ( she couldn ' t have missed us because we were sitting in the large table closest to the cash register kitchen . ) i was really fed up so i complained to the chef manager and she apologized . however , at the end of her apologetic talk she said " did you get that ma ' am " i felt so embarrassed that i brought my friends here and i told them that food is great and so is the service . but cindy proved me wrong . only reason why i give two stars is the good food , the service was zero . 
it ' s a cozy place just off steinway . i ' ve been here on two occasions and both experiences have been delightful . my recent visit i walked in for lunch and was seated immediately . the disco tots are a must ! they ' re tator tots drenched in cheese and gravy . i had the ring of fire burger this time around but i don ' t think anything could top off sugar hill . from both visits , there are many memorable dishes it ' s too much to name ! definitely get the atomic fire balls though , they ' re amazing . the service was excellent too . i wish i had gotten my servers name but she was extremely helpful and nice and came to check on us quite often . i will definitely be coming back ! 
went for lunch with a friend . super cute decor , great music , attentive service , and delicious food . going back for dinner . can ' t wait to try some of the items on the much more extensive dinner menu . hoping to be able to give them N stars for dinner ! 
it is a very good place to come with family to shop for bbq dinner . fresh fish all the time , they even wash and clean it for some tips . if you go there pretty often , you may make some connections so you know what ' s coming next days . my favorite blue tail comes on thursdays mostly , i am very glad we can enjoy this place . 
this more of a N . N star rating . my favorite part of city steam is the stand up comedy show . i always have a great time . i have also been here for dinner a couple of times . i dread the times i get a certain server because he is just soooooo slow . but besides that fact , the food quality has been inconsistent . my favorite thing to order is probably the sweet potato tater tots . during one visit , my friend ordered a caesar salad with salmon . the salmon was very fishy , which she reported to our server . the manager on duty took the dish off our bill , and gave her a coupon to return for a free sandwich meal entree at her next visit , which i thought was great . 
i just discovered this place a month ago . . what took so long . it ' s amazing . the vibe , the food , the staff are incredible . the gnocci salted choc caramel cheeseckae are ridiculous obscene how good it is . . . will keep coming coming . . . took my in-laws family here for dinner they accomodated us so well . woohoo awesome
this place was horrible . my fianc and i order mac and cheese bites that were still cold in the middle . . disgusting . i wish i could ' ve been happier . . i had high expectations going here . truly disappointed . . velveeta is better . save your money . 
classic newark . . . . go get a recession pie and an italian dog ! ! 
i think this restaurant should be retired from yelp . it ' s not even worth reviewing . habana is a serious new york institution that needs no explanation and is above a bunch of clowns discussing the pros and cons . best time to go disgustingly hot and humid nights of nyc summer . con closes at midnight . 
lots of places in new haven serve great pizzas . usually the top ranked places are pepe ' s , modern , sally ' s ( in no particular order ) . those who have been to bar add it to the mix . however , bar has an environment better than the other three ( by far ) so as a sit-down restaurant , it ' s much much better . quality of pizza ? phenomenal , but that was already made clear by uttering the name in the same breath as pepe ' s . it ' s thin crust , open brick-oven cooked , odd shaped apizza ( new havenites generally refer to their pizza as apizza ) . ingredients are fresh and they don ' t chintz you . my personal favorite is the white pie ( no red sauce , which would make it a red pie ) with mashed potato and bacon or the red pizza with cherry peppers . yum , i ' m getting hungry writing this . the beer is fantastic , some of which they brew themselves on premise . very fresh and crisp . lager leaves a bit to be desired , but their ipa ' s are perfectly balanced with some bitterness and nice grassy citrusy notes . now i want a beer . 
went here for valentines day dinner and was quite impressed . the service was great , the wine even better . was pleasantly surprised at how moderately priced the menu was . the ambience was great and the views of the park and columbus circle were amazing . overall , a great experience and i will definitely be going back soon . one more thing , cotton candy for dessert ! 
very attentive staff . service is phenomenal and the food is excellent . everything i ' ve had has been amazing and the specials are to die for . we love this place . 
food and service was great ! . just beware of the non-wine drinks they are a little unappetizing . also they should think about using towers for the tapas . a table can get filled quick with all those little plates . overall good experience . 
i ' ve been to this place once before and it was good so decided to go back . we ended up going at a really busy time which is good for the business but instead of putting our name down on the list and telling us how long the wait would be , they refused to take our name down saying they are full now and we have to come back in N hrs to put our name down . i ' ve never heard of such practice . . . they were being so rigid and weren ' t making much sense . . . need some work in the service department . 
reading terminal market is an integral part of philadelphia ' s culture and history . you will find wonderful restaurants and vendors throughout the market and a truly unique atmosphere . if you are in town for even one day , come check it out around lunch time you won ' t be disappointed . for those of you whining on yelp about it being crowded , please stop embarrassing yourself . its a N year old market in the middle of one of the largest cities in the usa it ' s supposed to be busy . 
usually i am not a big fan of sicilian pizza but now im a believer . . the service is super fast and friendly and had N slices and a drink for under N bucks cant beat that ! ! don ' t waste your time or money on the regular slices stick to the square pie ! 
great casusal place to grab dinner . there are lots of options on the menu and i love that even though it ' s a pub kind of place , they still have vegetarian options . to me , this is the pefect place to grab a table with friends and catch up over food and drinks . everyone can find something on the menu they are happy with and the waitstaff is friendly . my friends love the chocolate fondue for dessert . 
i would give the food a N . N s , but the overall service and atmosphere is why i gave this place N s . truly delicious , definitely coming back when family comes to visit us ! although the place was pretty crowded on a saturday night , they were able to seat us right away . i agree with other reviews , this restaurant reminds me of a little nicer olive garden . the bread and hummus were delicious - a bit salty though . we ended up having the N pasta dishes , and fell in love with their zesty spaghetti with shrimp dish . the prices are very reasonable for everything you get . from what i saw , every meal seemed to be plentiful . you definitely won ' t leave here hungry ! ps the N bottle of wine menu is pretty amazing ) they also have a pretty extensive wine menu book . 
fabulous ! ! gluten free pizza was awesome with the best crust i ' ve had in a long time . i ' m pretty sensitive to gluten , and they were great - and i didn ' t even get sick ! definitely recommended ! ! ! 
great food and drink . one of the best places to go to get a proper drink served right . try the rattling bird or the cobblestones and a tall pint . also check out there sunday breakfast , best eggs in a nest around . if there ' s only one place to go in hartford this is it . 
buyer beware N surcharge for ice in your glass . allow me to explain . . i found myself at good dog bar recently with my boyfriend , simply because it was freezing cold out and we wanted a nightcap before calling it a night ( had dinner at nearby la viola , which was awesome ! ) . didn ' t have especially good vibes walking up to good dog bar , but it was windy as what and we had no real expectations , so we went for it . even though it was not crowded and we sat at the front of the bar , bartender ignored us for the first N minutes . finally he threw us a nod and gave us drink menus - then proceeded to watch tv at the other end of the bar for another nearly N minutes . finally dude takes our order - i got a macallan on the rocks ( i know , uncommon request at a bar like this , but it ' s a dive bar , how expensive could it be right ? ) . my boyfriend got whatever elysian that was on tap ( N beer in N oz glass for N ? c ' mon ! ) . we asked how much and bartender couldn ' t give us a concrete answer on the spot ( " N ? wait , i don ' t know , something like that " ) . he comes back a minute later with a printed receipt and says " it ' s happy hour , and it ' s N . " i look at the receipt N for " rocks . " bartender notices my facial expression and proceeds to back peddle " well ya see , because it ' s on the rocks , you get a larger pour , so really it ' s a better deal than if i poured it neat , blah blah blah . " i was dumbfounded by this bs , are you kidding me ? it didn ' t sink in how ridiculous that excuse was until after the moment passed and the bartender slinked away from us . i ' ve been to a lot of bars in my life in many cities . . uppity nightclubs in manhattan , complete dives in pennsylvania , and everything everywhere in between . never have a heard this lame excuse to squeeze a couple bucks from me . N for a macallan is a little high for a random dive bar in philly , subtract N for " happy hour " , then add N for ice - but the lecture on why i shouldn ' t be upset about paying for ice was free . as was N-minute rental of the glass , lol . so weird . is this like ancient rome where ice was a rare commodity only for the richest of the rich ? don ' t get cute and pretend you ' re helping me out by giving me " more . " that tiny glass was overflowing with ice cubes , i ' m hardly getting " more . " if i wanted a " double " i would have asked for one . if i asked for N-N ice cubes ( like i should have ) , would i have been charged an extra N for an unsolicited " larger pour " ? the whole thing was pretty insulting considering the bar had nothing special to offer ( besides photos of dogs on the wall ) . sausage fest , overpriced jukebox , half-assed service , and questionable pricing . i know it ' s more of a beer bar , but don ' t insult those who might want a little liquor with this weird surcharge and lame rational . on the bright ( er ) side . . their beer menu on tap was interesting enough , though not much of a deal considering many of the prices were for N-N beers in N oz glasses ( even with N off for happy hr ) . i don ' t doubt that good times can be had here - clearly there are some positive reviews on yelp . dog photos are cute n stuff , but you can do a lot better than this place in this neighborhood . and if you ' re thinking about ordering any liquor with ice in it , buyer beware ! my amateur advise to this bar charging for ice in a rocks glass is short sighted , whether it results in shitty tips to the bartender that night or shitty online reviews the next day . 
i ' m giving it N stars bc of mixed feelings . nice staff and plenty of food for brunch today . took home the buttermilk biscuit and immediately put it in the fridge when i got home . it was not a hot summer day today . cut half , ate . went for the second half and noticed a dark teal colored mass , mold or mice poison , i don ' t know . but if they are serving old biscuits that isn ' t properly stored , that ' s bad . if they are serving old biscuits anyhow , still bad . if it ' s not mold , but random foreign objects around the counter , still bad . i had enjoyed my meal , but i won ' t be going there for their smothered biscuits after finding this in the middle of my biscuit ( about an eighth of an inch . ) the rest of the brunch was was served up quickly with generous portions . drink comes with brunch . unfortunately i will not return . can ' t take chances if i find things like that in my food . 
we were two couples who made a reservation , but when we arrived , there was no record of that reservation . that should have been a sign . nevertheless , it was early enough on a friday to secure a table for four . reminiscent of a railroad car---long and narrow--the space was dimly , albeit ambiently lit . it ' s byob and there are several wine shops around if you so desire . we tried between the N of us an assortment of appetizers menage a trois , a carpaccio-arugula-garlic-ice cream salad , and a wild mushroom soup . lovely plating and easy on the palate . the entrees we chose ranged from the salmon belly special , veal , cod , and mahi . the black orzo of the cod was over-salted as was the salmon seasoning . again , pleasant plating . the nutella dessert was fine . but the coffee should have come with the dessert as requested . our service was fine , but the waiter was of that arrogant ilk ( unlike the staff at asbury park ' s porta who enjoy what they do without the airs ) . and never , never in my life have i been rippe off at a restaurant . the maitre d ' who took the cash and credit card slipped himself a N . i ' ve never experienced the like and as a result we won ' t be going back to blu . so count your bills and dig in ---not into your plates--to your wallets . 
i really wanted to love this place , since i had heard so much about it , but it just wasn ' t that great . the wait was over an hour and a half when i went one friday , which i could have gotten over if the food had blown me away , but it just didn ' t . the ribs weren ' t the fall off the bone consistency that you expect to find at a quality bbq joint , and the sides were extremely bland ( my mac and cheese was also cold ) . i would like to give a nod to the staff - our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating and did her best to get us our food out asap since we had been waiting so long . 
you have to try this place . . . one of my top five meals ever ( and it was just brunch ! ) food - there were a lot of tasty looking options on the menu . my husband and i shared six of the " traditional tapas . " they were delicious ! each was flavorful , but not overpowering . they were served warm and brought out at an appropriate pace . the only thing that didn ' t wow me was the spicy potatoes . . . they were just fries ( though they were good fries . ) service - our waitress was attentive , but not overbearing . atmosphere - quite nice . . . the big windows in front let in a lot of light . it is spacious , clean , and simply decorated . cost - our bill was appropriate to the quality , no complaints . try it out ! 
pari , how i lurrrrrve thee . given the hit-or-miss quality of the food around the penn campus , this is one place in which i can have confidence that i will get a quality , fresh food dish . and it is consistently good . the modular nature of this food and the willingness of the staff to accommodate your needs is what wins us over . their menu selections are suggestions--if you want to modify something , say you want an egg white omelette instead of the whole egg on your crepe , they will make it for you . you can choose as many , or as few , of the fillings as you want , so you can get a truly customized meal . just tell them light cheese , extra cheese , light sauce , extra sauce , whatever suits you--and they listen . sometimes i get just an egg and cheese crepe and they don ' t charge full price for those , which is nice . and if you just want an omelette and no dough , they will fix that too . you can also choose from three different crepe batters--herb , honey wheat , and hardstone white . i am a fan of honey wheat myself . this place is great for a weekend brunch when the waits are short and houston hall is quiet . given the lack of good breakfast places around the campus , give this a try if you long for something like pancakes . the crepe batter isn ' t sweet , but combined with fresh fruits and some sweet sauce like caramel or honey or chocolate makes it come darn close . again , the honey wheat is my favorite batter , and paired with the sweet fruit and sauce is so incredibly good . i will caution vegetarians ( as i am one myself ) to kindly ask the staff if they will wipe the grill and the little bowls in which they hold the fillings before putting them on the crepe as sometimes meat pieces will get mixed in . that ' s really my only complaint , and that ' s pretty minor overall and easily solvable . fruit for the sweet crepes is cut up directly over your freshly cooked crepe batter . i only wish they also had tofu as a filling option too ! something like a tofu teriyaki crepe with veggies might be a nice addition to the menu . or a veggie burrito crepe with tofu . 
this place was ok . it was really cheap ! N for N buffets and two sodas . crab legs are N . N lb will i come back again ? probably . my mom is obsessed with china buffets . 
i have eaten and pf changs restaurants in warrington , princeton and naples florida . i have never yet personally been disappointed . the service , quality of food , customer service , ambiance , and pricing were all excellent for an upscale chain restaurant , each time i have visited them . 
you probably wouldn ' t believe me if i had said i planned my vacation in ny just to try thiru ' s dosa . you are right i didn ' t , but stopping for thiru ' s dosa was on top of my agenda ! i am addicted to dosa and coconut chutney ever since i was introduced to it by my tamil friends . thiru ' s coconut chutney was very close to my friend ' s home made version , i just don ' t understand why the restaurants can ' t make a chutney like that . samosa was awesome with sweet sauce and its only N . N . i always go for a plain ( sada ) dosa , it was just perfect for me . batter was perfectly fermented , how do i know ? ? ? because the dosa was slightly sour and that ' s how it ' s supposed to be . and the sambhar ( lentil soup ) was perfect for the dosa with a hint of spicyness . overall a restaurant quality stuff except better with a better view and lots of outdoor seating . i envy you new yorkers not only for thiru but for all the cheap eats such as mamoun ' s N falafel , halal meat vendors , papaya hot dogs , sweet smell of honey roasted nuts . . . . . . why can ' t i have them in seattle ? 
customer service - as they served the rice as fast as a bullet that they already wanted us to leave . our waitress was a unaccomadating and unfriendly - with making faces . woah ! our table cannot fit our orders . we figured it out on how to put all pur orders properly on out table . waiters will just put meals by meals on edge of the table . horrible experience ever ! space is small . the servers are louder than their customers ! food - they have a " modern filipino cuisine " but only a small part of their menu . but if you want a filipino classic menu - go to queens ! you can have it with a reasonable price for a good homemade filipino classic . pork adobo , karekare even sisig is the same taste quality in the queens fil resto area . environment and ambience - small , dark , loud ! sadly , it ' s sad . they ' re making noise to filipino cuisine in the neighborhood but . . . customer service sucks ! 
we dined here for the first time on wednesday . it was shockingly clean for the neighborhood . we ordered a bbq chicken pizza . the crust was an average thickness , the cheese was good and the chicken flavorful . the pizza could have used more bbq sauce but it was still a great pizza . i can ' t wait to try one of their mexican themed pizzas ! the price was great for the quality of food as well ! 
best sushi asian happy hour in the les ! N . N for drinks , rolls , and more can make for a very cheap meal that will fill you up ! check-in gets you free edamame and we also shared an assortment of rolls , chicken wings , crab rangoon , fried rice and seaweed salad . the chicken wings were delicious as was the crab rangoon . the fried rice was flavorful and the rolls were also quite tasty . i definitely will be back to enjoy happy hour here again ! les best kept sushi secret ! 
we went with friends the other night- and it was delicious ! my boy friend and i had the spicy pork dolsot bim bop plus a shrimp tempura roll and a special roll ( i can ' t remember what it was called ) . our friends had the veggie dolsot bim bop and some veggie rolls . everything was fresh ! the place is clean and hip but not intimidating . service was great ! and it ' s byob so you can save some cash on booze ! i ' ll def . be back there soon ! 
having dined at ernesto ' s many times before going to the orchestra at the kimmel center , i was happy to know that a new restaurant had opened nearby . despite the convenient location , the comparison between that restaurant and russet was as different as night is to day . to get an idea of the menu , i had taken time to look at the russet website before going . i learned that one of the main courses for the evening was scallops . the presentation of the dish was very attractive , but there were two ( N ) scallops on the plate in the photo . when we arrived to the restaurant , i asked the server if the picture i had seen represented accurately the number of scallops i could expect . i was told that there could possibly be three ( N ) scallops , depending on the size of them . for my first course , i chose a beet and pear salad . the beets were very salty , and there was one sliver of a piece of pear . my partner had ravioli stuffed with gorgonzola . both appetizers were beautifully presented however , the portions were very small . the ravolli were the size of a . N cent coin . there were probably N - N of them . a golf ball cut in half would accurately describe the size of each salty beet - a total of N golf-ball size beets ( cut into two ) . since the scallop main course would not have been enough food for me , i chose the striped sea bass served with mashed potatoes , and this dish was good - not excellent , albeit insufficient . my partner chose the pork shank , served with red beans . i tasted it and found it to be insipid . i am used to dining at fine restaurants in philadelphia , and i have no qualm about the price for fine dining in a beautiful atmosphere when the quality and quantity of the food are equivalent - or at least near equivalent to the price . i found , however , that neither the quantity nor the quality of taste justified the cost of the meal . our server was pleasant . the wall decor was unimpressive . to recreate the atmosphere of a country inn , the white tablecloth at ernesto ' s was replaced by a bare table . our overall impression did not whet the appetite for dessert or coffee . we asked for the check , and left , promising never to return . 
this is a really simple burger place the burger is served on toasted white bread and the only options you can get on your burger is tomato and onions . as one of the signs says inside , " this is not burger king . you don ' t get it your way . you get it my way or you don ' t get the damn thing . " now i am fine with this because their burger is pretty good . 
the food at geno ' s steaks are great ! ! the steak rolls are filled to the top withthe toppings you want and the food is hot ! ! ! ! 
went there with a party of N . the food was ok . wine , not so great . servers didnt really have it together . . . but worst part . . . . they kicked us out to seat another party . . . after we dropped over a grand on the dinner . plates of dessert had to be left so they could accomodate the next group . rude i will never go back there . 
okay , so this is how you do it . simply don ' t eat anything for about N-N hours . stand in line . get a slice of artichoke and a slice of margherita . also grab a diet coke from the fridge , so you feel as though you are doing something to offset the gazillions of calories you are about to consume . work your way to the sidewalk with box in hand , if you can , gently elbow someone off the bench outside , or stand at the counter and then enjoy new york at it ' s best ! 
i have heard so much about the burgers here and have been wanting to try one for quite some time . what a disappointment ! the burger was overcooked , dry and tasteless and the fries were soggy and just not good . it seemed as if they had both been pre-cooked and sitting in the kitchen waiting to be served . i wouldn ' t have minded that it was all so over-priced if it had been excellent like i had expected . 
i must say the negative reviews are appalling . i can ' t believe all the negative reviews on this place all because of one thing . i ' ve been here every other day for N months straight during the summer , and now try to come every weekend . i love it here . this is a new establishment so they are working through what works , and what doesn ' t . the food is great . its different and creative but not so creative that you wouldn ' t want to try it . ( think the big mac ' s special sauce ) they have N kinds and they ' re all very yummy . i ' m addicted to the homemade hand cut french fries and adult shakes . the drinks are great and aren ' t weak like some spots . you can count on a good mixed drink . ( shout out to my fave bartenders stan davis ! ) ) also in the evening , usually restaurants in the city close at around Npm-Npm . this place stays open til Nam and serves til about Nam . its great to stop by after a dinner date and dance ( they have awesome djs scheduled almost every night ) or if you get up and out late or just get off of work too late , pyt is the perfect place to come chill . no one judges you here , its not snooty and doesn ' t have a lot of uptightness in the atmosphere . ( think starbucks but with burgers and alcohol lol p ) i ' ve known tommy for about N-N years now and he has really worked hard to get a place of his own to cater to the public . i don ' t know another establishent where the owner comes almost everyday to make sure things are on the up and up . my knowing him doesn ' t equate to a N star review . i gave N stars because i can easily say , i promote this place subconciously . i find myself telling all of my friends , ( old and new ) to come to pyt even if they aren ' t going with me . where else do you know that serves dollar drinks as a happy hour from Np-Np everyday ? i love it ! hands down 
tonight was my second time to this place and i really want to like it , it has great potential but their servers destroy the place ! i was there once before and by no exaggeration my friends and i waited an hour for our food and we had to get our food wrapped because our lunch time was over . i went back again tonight and unfortunately nothing has changed the food is good but i waited until the entire dessert was eaten before i even got my tea and then when it did arrive at the table i have to wait N mins for it to brew . then i did a crazy thing and asked for honey with my tea and ready for this . . . . i was charged N for a thimble size of honey ! ! ! ! hello do they not know that their customers might want honey with their tea and it should come along with the N . N ! what a shame for the owners they need to wake up and realize how their servers are killing their business ! 
there are many ups and downs about this restaraunts including service , quality and atmosphere . pros quality of food was very good and taste wise , it was very authentic atmosphere was okay cons service was terrible for a saturday night do not expect food to come out quickly but do expect the wait staff to forget about your requests and orders very understaffed ( N waiters serving N tables constant excuses from the wait staff were very frustrating some dishes came out cold warm and not hot in summation , the food was a N N but the long waiting times and terrible service throughout the night easily crossed off this local restaraunt from my list of places to eat . 
came here with my friends yesterday . at first i was very impressed , the interior was very nice and it smelled amazing in there . however my good impression was quickly demolished by the terrible service we received . we were served by a waitress with dyed blonde hair with brown roots growing out and bad eyebrows . she had such an attitude while she took our order ( she looked like she really hates her job ) and would walk by every N minutes to keep an eye on us even though we weren ' t doing anything . it happened to be my friends Nth birthday and we had a cake on our table and she came and told us to " keep it on the down low " but with her tone and facial expression you could clearly see she was telling us to put it away . afterwards the man serving us water ( who was very kind ) offered to put the cake on a plate for us and although we declined he insisted . this lead to an argument between him and the waitress in the back where they even had to consult their manager in a different room . he came back with the cake and apologized for not being able to put our cake out and wished my friend happy birthday once more . before we were finished with our pizza the waitress swung by again and gave us our check , which clearly meant she was trying to get us out as soon as possible . don ' t get me wrong the pizza was really delicious but i think the next time i ' m craving pizza i ' de rather call up dominos . 
this place is a pretty penny , and there is almost always a wait to get in . it ' s full of suits . the off-the-menu burger is what i am here to talk about really . it ' s wonderful . i sat at the bar with my cousin and we ordered the burgers . they run out of them toward the end of the day , and since we heard they were amazing we decided to get them . they were made perfectly , with oozing cheese and delicious bread . they also make their own ketchups so it was really good and went well with the fries . it was a surprisingly good portion too . not microscopic like you ' d expect in a place of this caliber . good experience , the non-alcoholic " cocktails " were delicious and refreshing and the bartender that served us was a nice guy . however , i am pretty sure i wouldn ' t return unless someone was paying for me ) def not a fan of how expensive it is . 
our third visit . i ordered crawfish etoufee and wife buttermilk fried dark meat chicken . also delicious abita root beer . while waiting i saw hot sauce on table which i thought might be nice to add to my entree . but when crawfish etoufee arrived it was perfect . nothing could be added to make it better . we shared a bailey bread pudding which we liked . our big disappointment is their pricing . web menu says crawfish etoufee is N . N , at table it is N . N web menu says buttermilk fried dark meat chicken is N . N , at table it is N . N so N N stars
i love this place . food is excellent and it ' s not expensive at all . and they deliver for orders over N ! you ' ll probably see me there . . . 
excellent . . . from the time you enter this small chic sushi palace , you are treated to a magnificent meal ! absolutely on the must eat again locations . 
my colleagues and i ate here while in town at the iste conference . our server was awesome . she thoroughly new the menu and answered our many questions with a smile . the food was amazing . everything was perfectly cooked . the price was reasonable as well ! 
the pond house is so close to home when i finally made it there i was amped . they gave us a tablet menu with instructions . although we are young a reasonably comfortable with technology menus with instructions seem a little tacky to me . we had the veggie nachos which were good and fun . our entrees on the other hand were fair at best . each entree had an element worth praise but neither were successful . i thought the game bird was cooked and seasoned nicely but the pilaf only fair . the gastrique had the the taste and texture of grocery store jar of preserves . i will give it another try . i still have high hopes for the brunch menu . . . ! ! ! 
really delicious burger . i was disappointed that their take on shepherd ' s pie wasn ' t available but the burger was so good it totally wiped out any bad feelings . the service was friendly and timely . i also tasted the green pasta and the lamb chops . they were delicious too . 
i ' m a california girl , living in nyc and loving it but missing the good life at times . one thing i can honestly say san francisco is missing , other than crappy winters and even crap-ier summers is pepe ' s . lordy how i wish it was there , had san francisco come up with pepe ' s it would be near perfect . but it didn ' t , and so i make my way every few years to new haven and the mecca of pizza that is pepe ' s because it ' s that good . the perfect pie . 
the food was excellent , the atmosphere great . our server , glenn was the best we ' ve had in new york . sebastian kept me in bread and butter all night ! water was always full . we ' ve been here N days and this was the best . finish your review copyright N yelp inc . , N mission street , san francisco , ca N , u . s . a . 
i really liked this place , excellent food and ambient decor was inviting , service was attentive , i just need to get back here ) 
had lunch here recently and just loved this place . sat outside and it was a very pleasant , nice atmosphere . staff was friendly and courteous . food was terrific . had the crabmeat avocado salad which was awesome ! also had the oysters and a cheese plate . presentation , food and cocktails were all excellent . 
went out for an early valentine ' s day dinner and was not disappointed . my wife and i celebrated our engagement at the original location almost N years ago so this was a big trip down memory lane for us . we had reservations however , our table was not ready . the staff was apologetic and we were seated after a short wait . the service was excellent . our server was very attentive and did an excellent job answering our menu questions . had an awesome shrimp appetizer off their specials list that evening . a bit pricey - N . N for N shrimp , but the vodka blush sauce they were in was amazing ! decent bread served while we were waiting . refilled without asking as well . salads are a bit small , but the dressing and shaved cheese on them were very tasty . wife had the chicken sorrentino and i had the steak fiorentina - both were very good . came with a bowl of pencil points - the gravy was yummy . the steak was served with fresh chips - a bit odd and very salty . for dessert we had the ricotta cheese cake and the chocolate lava cake . all-in-all an excellent night out . we were very pleased . 
what a selection of tasty treats ! had the seitan sandwich , which had a nice zing to it . more importantly , we tried several desserts cannoli , french silk cheesecake and a chocolate chip cookie sandwich . my wife commented that it was the best nondairy cheesecake that she ' s had . i loved the cannoli . the cookie sandwich was good , not great . we ' ll be back for sure . 
the scene older looking pub feel with a cool , loud and fun vibe . usually crowded . seats are very close and personal . sitting at the bar is better . the service table service was good . service at the bar was better . the food first , every protein on this list was super fresh . the oysters clams and pbr deal is not to be missed . seafood gumbo was meaty and tasty , no homo . fried oysters were best i ' ve ever had . steamed muscles in garlic-i wanted to bathe in that broth . fried clams were the whole belly kind ( as it should always be ) and gave me a foodboner . the scallops were perfection . salmon , cooked expertly and melted in my mouth . con you have to go to the shit show that is . . . bleeker . . . the close , almost on top of you seating that you can smell your neighbors breathe is always , " a thing " with me . . . the loud and controlled chaos atmosphere . not intimate . the verdict been here three times . by never disappointing in service and because of the consistent freshness and perfectly cooked product , it is the best seafood restaurant i ' ve been to in nyc , so far . the price is more then fair for the overall experience . you just have to deal with the tight table accommodations which i happily do to have the amazing seafood . 
went out for a special birthday dinner and went away disappointed . very inexperienced waiters told us the special was stripped bass when it was actually sea bass . started clearing the table when people were still eating ordered housemade gelato , it was all crystallized . not what you would expect from maxs
lovely decor cute waiter - he was very good in explaining the food too . cute and professional ? oh yeah ) the marrow bone appetizer is so good ! i never had it before so i thought it was like the most amazing thing ever though my friends were all like oh we have had it before , but they still liked it . love those bread they have for you before you meal too . they have the crust just right . got the chicken liver and bacon cavatelli . i should ' ve gotten the daily pasta ( thursday ) . i thought i liked chicken liver our entire table had our food to go so it isn ' t too bad . 
great place for a quick bite . i have been here twice . i get the plate with brown rice chicken and salad . really good . although please don ' t joke about the ottoman empire . the meat handler doesn ' t appreciate that . 
i love the food here , i would go here over pho ha if the parking was better . the N star is for the food itself because it ' s flavorful . portion is also a little smaller than pho ha in my opinion for pho and rice dishes , but if you are one of those that can ' t control your portion size , then this place is it ! ) you get just the right amount ( lol less calories ) . i also think there are a little more choices here so i def . recommend . 
simply delicous ! the sushi was the best i have ever had . the chefs are very nice and attentive . my family of four ordered the omakase and even though it was very expensive it was worth every single pennies ! the fish was very fresh and melted in your mouth . if it wasn ' t so expensive i would go everyday ! amazing . . . . . . delicous
i love this place ! how can you not crave their spicy chicken empanadas ! it ' s the perfect appetizer to their grilled skirt steak ( entrana a la plancha ) . i would definitely go here more often for dinner if their restaurant was bigger and there wasn ' t such a long wait on the weekends . but that doesn ' t stop me from ordering large amounts of empanadas for pickup for my roommates and me . yummm . a must try if you just moved to hells kitchen . oh also , you should dry their dessert empanada - trust me , i was slightly skeptical in the beginning too , but it ' s amazing . it reminds me of rickshaw ' s dessert dumpling . 
i have never been moved to write a review , good or bad , about a place until now . was visiting friends in nj and they suggested we try this new place in trenton . all sounded well until we actually got there and the entire night took a turn for the worst . . . . the absolute worst . our server , a young woman in her N ' s who never gave us her name , had few answers for our questions about the menu and spent most of the evening drinking soda and mingling with her co-workers . when we finally figured out things on our own and placed an order that ' s when it really hit the fan . the " giant " meatball we ordered as an app was hardly bigger than you ' ll find alongside your pasta anywhere else and was nearly ice cold . the other apps , the calamari and the mussels , were both rubbery and without any distinguishable flavor . it could only get better from here , right ? wrong ! dinner arrived after a N minute gap between the first course and my tilapia was presented to me in parchment paper that was burnt through on the bottom , so needless to say the fish was bone dry . my friend ' s steak was overcooked and his wife ' s pasta resembled something i last came across in college at the campus cafeteria . add to it that a cover band was now playing at volumes that made it impossible to even speak to one another and well . . . . . i think you get the picture . total cost for this train wreck experience , N . avoid this place like the plague ! 
give it a try , guarantee the tempting taste will satisfy your appetite . 
i can quite the stickler when it come to my yard bird , and jerk pit cafe does not disappoint . i was in the mood for some fried chicken , but decided to go off the beaten path a bit and give jerk pit a try . solid jerk chicken with a hefty and delish side of rice and beans . definitely on the list for future visits . 
too f in ' good to believe . off scale in essentially every dimension my personal fave is the whole boneless porgy . liked it so much i ordered a second . was even thinking about a third . . . it ' s one of those restaurants that makes me wonder . . . why did i spend all those years not living in new york . . . ? ) 
i had been wanting to try this place for brunch for a while . they don ' t take reservations so you ' ll have to patient if you ' re not the first one there . the wait wasn ' t terrible for a party of two - maybe N minutes . they have some great brunch options and not just your run-of-the-mill eggs and pancakes offerings . i went for the red flannel hash which consisted of red potatoes , corned beef red beets with a sunnyside egg . it was unique and delicious . loved the addition of the beets . my friend ordered the farmer ' s breakfast which had eggs , swiss chard and yukon gold potatoes . we also ordered a side of cheddar grits . everything was delicious and we ate our plates clean ! 
my family and i went for dinner and thought it was great ! we recommend the delicious ropa vieja , plantains and ribs . our kids loved the roast chicken and banana milkshakes . cute decor . good music . we definitely recommend this place ! 
i ' d been wanting to go here for awhile , especially after i read that it was voted as one of the top N new urban restaurants by frommer ' s . i visited barbuzzo last week with a friend , and the food definitely did not disappoint . we split the sheep ' s milk ricotta , topped with a drizzle of balsamic reduction ( which was amazing ! ) , and the risotto for dinner . for dessert , we had the warm apple bread pudding and the salted caramel budino . our server was very friendly and well-informed about the menu . my only gripe was that the service was quite a bit slower than i would have expected . i ' m definitely going back and bringing more friends with me ! 
worst pizza ever . it came an hour after we ordered it and it came burnt and paper thin . and only after they overcharged us . don ' t order from here unless you like paper thin burnt pizza from a place that over charges you and takes more than an hour to deliver it . so ridiculous ! 
if you are black do not even bother going here as you will basically be ignored . the lady at the door acted as if she didn ' t want to seat us and it took over N mins before a waiter came to our table . we were there for over N mins without getting any drinks . we got up and got the hell out of there . i can ' t judge the food as we weren ' t given a chance to try any . racism is alive and well here . 
omg if you like fries and sauce then you are gonna be in absolute heaven ! these french ( or should i say pommes frites ) were unlike any fry i have tasted and the variety of sauces were impressive and delicious . i ordered a regular that was N . N ( lots of fries and easily splittable ) and got the roasted garlic , cheddar , and parmesan peppercorn mayos on the side . all three were delicious and i also sampled ( ask for samples because they are very generous ) multiple more including their newest which is the black truffle mayo ( amazing ! ) . the sauces are N extra or you can get N for N . N but it ' s so worth the extra . where else can you get such unique sauces ? they also will give you lids so you can take them home to enhance other sub-par fries ) which mayo is the best you may ask ? honestly , i think it depends what your in the mood for because they are all very unique and delicious . i will say that the three i got were very good but the other one i was close to getting was the smoked eggplant mayo which was very good . as for the fries , they were very big , thick , crunchy , hot , and were even good by themselves with just a bit of salt . not your average fry by any means . all in all , if you haven ' t experienced true belgium fries then you definitely need to hit this place up because it will change your whole french fry and sauce outlook . 
first time here , great cuban food and atmosphere . 
i love when you order and they tell you half hour forty five minutes and the food comes in like N . N stars for that , even though i had to scurry downstairs to answer the door . what can i tell you , i am a huge fan of tiffin , with that said , ekta is closer , and from what i hear the chef is from tiffin so how could i go wrong , not to mention that their food is a tad cheaper which i can feel less guilty for ordering indian at least once a week for my chicken tikka addict daughter . which was fabulous . the naan hot and soft and perfect . not sure i want to fully abandon tiffin but hey i can spread the love equally . just another reason to love living and never leaving our lovely neighborhood . 
the octopus was incredible . the dumplings were also awesome . great service . good beer selection . great meal ! 
good burger but kinda pricey . don ' t like their truffled beet salad and their smashed potatoes . not sure if its worth a second visit . 
zomg . the sicilian . tgfvbn dwjhdsqnk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! all kidding aside , it truly is crack shaped in a square . let me explain the crust crispy with just the right amount of oil . it is so good that i will wait for them to bring out a new pie , just so i can get a corner . the base crispy on the bottom , fluffyyy on the inside the cheese stringy but not too stringy the sauce crack best of all , there ' s two layers of crack . it goes dough--crack--cheese--crack--sprinkle of cheese . this is probably how they keep customers coming back every week ( sometimes multiple times per week depending on how much one has been drinking self esteem level ) . don ' t waste time , money or calories ordering anything other than the original . ok ? ! now harness your inner precious john candy chris farley and indulge ! 
interesting atmosphere . the kitchen is basically behind the bar and they cook everything right there with maybe one or two tiny stoves , but the food is great . 
i love everything about this place ! ! amazing food , always fresh and delicious . service is top notch , atmosphere is fun , great place to take your significant other or a group . in my opinion , one of the best restaurants in ct ! 
i ' ve had all of them - black label burger at minetta , shack , hubert keller ' s place in vegas , in out etc . N is my very favorite . their burger is well seared , always juicy . the bun is perfectly buttered and warmed . the poblano peppers are a great touch . they have a great beer selection of beers . service is good and quick . i travel to find a good burger . but i don ' t know if i ' ll find one that i like more than N ' s special blend of awesome . 
when a tv show visits a diner or any eating establishment they focus on the one or two things the diner does best . in this case it was breakfast and specifically , corned beef hash . we took a ride and order eggs with the homemade hash and it was terrific . freshly made , crispy and worth the drive . for the reviewer from mass i love the idea of the road trip and trying places you ' ve seen , we do it all the time while traveling . id just recommend that you stick to what the specialty was . other then that , the diner is small , service is nice , its a bit out of the way as others have mentioned but go get a breakfast wrap or stick with the corned beef hash , the owner is making it from scratch every morning . cheers . 
if you want to hear journey and kid rock on the jukebox and get dirty looks from guidos , not to mention potentially risking an unprovoked fight during football season , this is your place . the food is whatever typical frozen bar stuff ( except the pizzas that aren ' t bad ) , i personally have seen roaches ( small ones , but roaches nonetheless , on the garbage cans right in the back dining room , feet from the dining tables ) and the atmosphere is nonexistent , barring loud tvs and worse jukebox music . i have to say though , the bartenders are almost always friendly as long as you don ' t want a mixed drink w more than N ingredients . i shouldn ' t have to tell a bartender how to make a tom collins . do yourself a favor and walk down the street to obal ' s inn . 
it looked decent enough so i walked up the steps for lunch . nobody seated me . i stood on the deck waiting for a hostess , a waiter , anybody . . . went inside to see if there was a hostess . . . nobody , just more customers . went back outside , waiters saw me and completely ignored me ! i said , " excuse me , can anybody seat me ? i ' d like to eat here . " a waitress replied , " oh somebody will be with you any moment . " i waited for the hostess and i should have just left ( but i was starving ! ) . anyway , food was just ok . way overpriced for what the end result is . shall not be going back . 
my experience at flat top is what has egged me on to finally create a yelp profile . unfortunately i can only comment on the service , which was incredibly disappointing . my companion and i left without ordering . i was there earlier today evening with a friend . the restaurant was probably a third full when we came in . we were waiting for over N minutes for someone to come over and serve us water , let alone take our order . two tables that were seated after us were promptly served with water , and had attentive servers . despite the restaurant being more than half empty , there was absolutely no move on part of the servers to look to us . what the hell ? i mentioned this on the way out to the lady manning the front of the house , and she looked like she didn ' t give a shit . ah well , i ' d rather take my money elsewhere . 
growing up in brooklyn in an italian family , its pretty damn hard to impress me with restaurant prepared italian food . adrienne ' s makes me wonder why i cook . what more can you say ? 
i am feeling a little weepy . this goes back to my high school days . shit , i ' m such a girl -- i ' m about to cry . damn you nostalgia . the food is okay . you don ' t go for the food . you go b c you want to chill with your friends in the middle of the night and you are starving . ct doesn ' t offer too many options . the breakfast is cheap , greasy and does the job . food at gold roc is definitely better . you don ' t understand , the people watching in the wee hours of the morning is insane . it ' s live entertainment , no questions about it . go for sheer entertainment value . 
my favorite breakfast place in burlington . everything is amazing and so fresh , my favorite are the buckwheat blueberry pancakes . especially on weekends , be prepared to wait an hour to get in , but the food is speedy once you are in there and well worth the wait . 
do not go here if you are black , you are not wanted here--as it was made clear that our party was not wanted here . our party that was N black had reservations for a party for an absolutly fabulous N year old . we arrived and the main room had two of about ten hibachi tables full . . . we were escorted ( relegated ) past them to a back room ( that never had another party escorted to . . . as the other room filled up to capacity with not another party that looked like us ) . we had a chef that was very nice and considerate of the kids . . . but had obviously spent more than his career there about N years ago . he was nice to the kids , but the food was cooked terribly unevenly . . . the bottom pile of shrimp was burned beyond recognition and the top barely touched by heat . all the while the other room that was full of people not containing us was full of dynamic , electric chefs and disco lights for other kids ( not our kids ) birthdays . its ok , there are plenty of establishments that we are all welcomed to . so please lets not us of all races that want to be of one reward these people with our money . 
food was pretty good . the place is a bit overpriced , but it isn ' t terrible . the food is quite delicious , and the menu is always different , which makes it interesting to go back multiple times . not bad a little pricey menu , but you get for what you pay . i can ' t wait to go back for the whole fish . small intimate space with seating at the bar . 
i ordered the meatballs here . seemed like the right thing to do . the deal is you order by marking up the menu they give you with the markers provided . i started out with a meatball smash . you first choose the type of meatball ( i went with spicy pork ) , then the type of sauce ( i had the spicy meat . sensing a theme here yet ? ) and the type of cheese ( mozzarella or provolone . i went with the former ) . then you can add sides . we ended up ordering N and splitting them within our party . they have different specials daily . regular items include mashed potatoes , polenta and various pastas . the smashes also come with a side salad . all meat is ground in house and you can taste the difference that makes . the smash is a really good sandwich . it comes on a nice warm and soft bun . fantastic . dessert is also a must here . same deal . choose type of cookie and type of ice cream and let the fun begin . we had caramel ice cream with a chocolate chip cookie . great way to end a meal . not much more to say about that . 
while i have been to salt creek grille several times , i found it , particularly , a nice restaurant for festive occasions , such as , my extended team dinner after our quarterly sales meets . last week , i met my former client industry colleague at a wine tasting dinner event . the N-course seafood-steak dinner was fantastic with the service that i have always been used to . . . it was a great way to reconnect . very nice ! 
i love this place ! over the weekend bought a sandwich tray , cheese tray and fruit tray for a party and they were all a huge success . all the food was delish and so reasonably priced . i ' d highly recommend this to any and every one ! ! not to mention the staff is so nice ! ! 
what a great place- everything on the raw bar is divine . the crab soup and halibut were so good that i ' d def order both again . their fish is super fresh . service was friendly and made us feel comofortable from the second we walked in . really interesting cocktails as well . loved it ! 
worst cheesesteak i ' ve ever encountered ! ! nobody microwaves all the ingredients o a cheesesteak an slaps it on bread ! ! never going there again
i just go for the bubble ( tea ) coffee . . . the iced vietnamese coffee with extra bubbles is amazing ! if i ' m spending N . N i ' d take this over a frappuchino anyday . bubbles are usually pretty good , but on the oversweetened side , so you might want to tell them to hold the sugar until you taste it . my only complaint ? they don ' t have splenda or artificial sweetner , so if you ' re not a sugar fan there are no options . small cute place , better for takeout than hangout . 
the only reason why i didn ' t give this place N stars is because the steak was terrible . the dry aged cote de boeuf is way overpriced . there are plenty of other places in the city for a far superior steak for alot less than N . the black label burger on the other hand was one of the best burgers i ' ve ever had . it ' s well worth the N dollar price tag . the bone marrow is also one of the best i have ever had . 
 cool place the pizzas are really good the salads and desserts are also good , although a little over priced ( or so i think anyway ) 
el vez is my favorite restaurant . love those fish tacos ! 
let me just say yum ! it is a cute restaurant in the upper west side which my friend found randomly . one thing i did not like was the hostest was kind of not that bright . we asked how long the wait was and she said omg it is really long you have two parties in front of you . i was ok two parties not that bad . she just stared and was expecting us to leave , but then i had to tell her can you just put our names down . i think she was either new or something because she had no clue what she was doing , but then another hostest approached us and told us the wait was going to be N minutes . . . ya that ' s not really long . for appetizers we ordered the meatballs and the fingerling potatoes . they were delicious ! the suace of the meatballs were just right . . not to sweet and not to sour . the potatoes , string beans , feta , and olives were a great combination . i also ordered the special which was pasta with beef ragu and cheese , and let me tell you it was good ! the beef ragu and the cheese was so flavorful and it was such a large portion that i could not finish it . the other people in my party enjoyed what they ordered as well . a really good find ! 
so we went for my mothers Nth birthday . my sister called far in advance and said we had a party of N . she called again that day to confirm and was told that they would set us up in front of the fireplace where there ' s a lot of room . we arrived at Npm and we were seated up a few stairs in an area too small for our large party and at an " l " shaped table where my sister was squished at the corner . it took our waitress more than N minutes to pour everyone water and she kept forgetting my brother-in-law even though he asked twice . onto the ordering . we all ordered salads ( not a difficult order ) and it took forever for some of us to get ours . some of us were done with our salads and still N minutes went by without some of us even getting ours . my brother-in-law complained and we were offered a free round of drinks . ok . then the entrees came and not until we waited another twenty minutes . my new york strip ( which i ordered medium-well ) was pink and bloody . i ate it because i like it that way too but it had a lot of fat on it and it was chewy . not impressed with the food at all and this is supposed to be a steak house . we had three waitresses and the waiting time was my biggest complaint . one star and that ' s it . i ' ll never go there again . maybe it ' s better if you ' re a smaller party or if you sit in the bar but not worth the N i paid for my steak and the N i paid for for the salad . this is the second time my sister and her husband went there and the first time they waited N hours to get their order taken and drinks ( i would have left way before that ) . not sure how they ' re still in business but this place is a waste of time . save your money . 
i ' m actually posting this for bluebird ' s stand on church street . do yourself a favor and try the candied bacon almonds . they are ridiculous . i could pretty much sprinkle them on anything and turn it into fabulous . a bit pricey ( N ) for the small bag but it ' s so worth it . 
the rumors are true , the tomato basil pizza is out of this world ! i also appreciated a slice of the deep dish cheese pizza . the breading was primo and very filling . we stumbled upon patzeria after wandering times square . the owner was incredibly nice , and even walked us through what was popular to help us decide . he even made sure we were enjoying our food . on the way out i thanked him for making probably one of the best slices of pizza i have ever had and he encouraged me to yelp and facebook the place . so here i am , saddened by the fact that i will be leaving tomorrow and going home to crappy pizza from cali . thanks for great time ny , but i gots to get home . like biggie , im going back , back to cali , cali . 
warning as of N N N , this place has N points in health code violations . i used to come here quite often too . choose for yourself . 
look , the nachos with vegan pork are incredible . they ' re really , really good . if you come for just the nachos , you ' ll be fine . but when i ask for the remaining half of my sandwich and fries ( big , friendly portions ! ) to go , i really , really , really don ' t want to open my box up at home to discover that you tossed out all my fries . that ' s my midnight snack you just screwed up . thanks , khyber . jerks . 
cao ! i am serbian , and i felt like i was eating my mother ' s food , it was that good ! i am really impressed . i am super psyched that i only live a couple of blocks away . i really like how i can sit there for N hours and not be stalked or even hounded if i wanted anything else . i also liked how around Nish the young jugo crowd come and hang out here and chat in serbian and drink a couple of beers and just talk . i felt like i was at my grandma ' s in banatsko novo selo ! do videnja , hvala ! ziveli ! ! 
this buffet is disgusting . i was eating and from the ceiling a big cockroach fell on the table . i talked to the staff about the cockroach problem but they just smiled and walked away . in this buffet there are many cockroaches . i would not recommend eating at this buffet . kitchens and bathrooms are the most common areas to find cockroaches . its very unhealthy and unsanitary . 
sunday afternoon lunch - great menu with choices for everyone . great appetizers and entrees with terrific flavor and decent prices . 
i really wanted to like this place ( mom pop shop , straightforward cooking , etc . ) , and after reading the previous reviews , i ventured past the familiar brunch spots on fdb to try this out . i ' m not familiar with brunch spots north of here so maybe it ' s good for the neighborhood , but there are just much better options south of Nth st , like maison harlem , harlem tavern , amy ruth ' s , even jimbo ' s . the bang for the buck just isn ' t there N for a breakfast sandwich on a mini biscuit ? they ' re N from the bodega and taste better . biscuit was too dense , grits were clumpy , eggs were over cooked , and the potatoes were lukewarm . service was friendly and personable , but not very present . i wish i lived closer so i could have another opportunity to see what the hype is about , but the food will not bring me back . 
the food is great but service is terrible . we ordered breakfast at Nam for delivery to fairfield office . but at N N we still have not received our breakfast . called several times , received different answers . one even says that they just prepared the order at N and it ' s out the door now ! absolutely awful
wanted some last minute breakfast with friends and did a quick yelp search . excellent service , very friendly-like most of philly . everyone agreed food was awesome . friend said his huevos rancheros was maybe the best breakfast he ever ate . . . jen ' s crespelle was nice as well . fresh , quality ingredients , and excellent prices . next time i ' m in philly i know i ' m taking my wife and daughter here ! great place ! 
very cool addition to the ironbound . a nice alternative to the other neighborhood burger joints . the food is pricey but the burgers are above average . the fries are perfect and the shakes are great ! most importantly , this place offers service with a smile . wonderful staff ! 
i had dim sum this saturday but the food was really bad . the clams tastes nasty . the environment there is really good though . but the waiter did not know the menu very well . won ' t come anymore . 
we took a couple here for dinner . the meals were great and so nice to have a salad bar as part of your meal . our waiter was ' t the best very slow an a little rude
ever wondered what real fresh-cut ramen tasted like ? well , ippudo is the perfect place to find out . the first time i was ever here was on an impromptu dinner with a friend . the second time , roughly a year later with the same friend . i tried a third time with a larger group of people , but it was a N hour wait , so my friends decided to pass . this place normally has an extremely long wait and you can ' t make reservations . you can only put your name down on a list the day of and see if they have space for you . luckily , the two times i made it in had wait times under N minutes . if you ' re down to wait , there ' s a bar near the entrance to bide your time and wet your appetite . i fell in love with the atmosphere of the place the moment i stepped into the dining area . upon entering the dim dinning area out back , you ' re greeted with all the waitresses and waiters with what i can only guess is " hello " in japanese . the layout changed a bit in between my two visits there . the current layout has booths for larger parties all along the left side ( as your entering ) peppered with large communal tables with one or two smaller tables with center arrangements large enough to give you and your neighbor seating across some privacy . on the right side there looks to be a short cook half kitchen for what seems to be where the fresh-cut noodles are prepared . the kitchen is directly behind all of this . the lighting is dim , giving a sort of private feel if you ' ve come with a guest or a date , so you can feel like you can comfortably have a conversation . there ' s music playing in the background , but it was never loud that you had to feel like you had to yell to have a conversation . surprisingly the menu isn ' t large , which is great . ramen places typically give a menu too large , so the newbie is left reading the menu items back and forth trying , but ultimately failing , to find something familiar . i ordered the special beef kalbi as an appetizer for me and my date and couldn ' t have been happier . she typically doesn ' t eat asian food ( her only ramen experience is from the packages of bad ramen ) , so she was supremely happy with the kalbi and couldn ' t wait to see how the ramen was . it was just enough to get us ready for the oncoming ramen flavor onslaught . i had the shiromaru ramen , which is the classic ramen . i was instantly impressed with it . it had fresh-cut ramen , which i ' ve never ever had before , most places make the broth , but buy premade ramen noodles . the noodles were boiled perfectly , soft , but not too delicate that it would turn into mush . the pork slices were flavorful and not too salty , but melted in your mouth . the soft-boiled egg , which is something that ' s pretty difficult to get right , was delicious . the outside of the egg had a slightly softer texture than your hard-boiled egg , but took in all the flavor of the ramen . the yellow yolk was perfect , it wasn ' t too gooey and still had its yellow sheen . the ramen broth was excellent , it wasn ' t oily as is typical of ramen broth and didn ' t have an overpowering salty or soy sauce flavor to it . you can tell it was made extremely fresh and not just sitting out reducing to a salty oily mess and complemented the fresh ramen noodles perfectly . if you have the desire to , for a few more dollars , you can ask for more ramen noodles . i ' ve done this twice and the noodles aren ' t are good as if you had it fresh with your broth , but still very satistying . if you can stomach the N bowl of ramen , then this is the best place in manhattan to grab your freshest bowl of ramen . 
i honestly don ' t understand where the hate is coming from for this place . this easily makes the top ten of best restaurants i have ever eaten at . here are my favorites dry fried green beans , mock eel , and buddha ' s sesame beef , with coconut gelato for dessert . if you order nothing else , get the buddha ' s sesame beef . it is vegetarian , but meat eaters and vegetarians alike can enjoy it . the seitan is cooked unlike anything i ' ve had before and is flavored perfectly . i ' m not sure why this place is labeled " chinese " , i would describe it more as asian fusion . it ' s a great place for a special occasion ( especially since it is on the pricey side ) . the family style serving is great , because you get to try some of everything . best food in burlington , try this place ! 
amazing coffee ! everything is organic . this place has an amazing juice smoothie bar . hands down to these guys . finally , someone in burlington is getting it right . no other coffee shop uses organic milk . i had a wheat grass shot along with the coconut maple latte ! angela made me the best coconut latte i have ever had . this was a first to me . who new having lattes without dairy could be so tasty ? 
ok for a glass of wine but too small and loud . 
we ordered an xl pizza here on a monday night . it took the pizza almost two hours to arrive and when we called they insisted it was on the way . terrible delivery service . still waiting as this is being written . not ordering from here again . 
i go here for lunch more often than i care to admit since i work within the mall . the food is always fantastic ! i ' ve never had an issue with the food or the staff . i also like how they ask for a donation to firehouses , and it only rounds your bill to the nearest dollar . 
good pork buns . but horrible service . ruined my experience . 
from shaden a student worker from the women ' s center southern connecticut state university . i had the great pleasure of having mama mary soul food cater our sistah hood luncheon and it was a pleasure having them do so . the service was great they were very attentive to us , they met every needs that we asked of them , great and huge thank you personally from me to sabrina . it was a pleasure ! the food omg , lets not even go there it was amazing aaaamazing . . . the banana pudding , and yams was delicious . the chicken wings was fried all the way through that was great to see because a lot of people cannot accomplish that with fry chicken ! i have to say , so thank you so much for the service that was provided , for our sistah hood luncheon ! 
good tacos burritos burrito bowls with a very similar setup to that of chipotle , except this place is a hole in the wall . you pick what you want ( taco , burrito , burrito bowl ) and you tell them what meat you want , and then they make it in front of you just like they do in chipotle . guac is extra , but thats to be expected . their spiciest hot sauce has some heat to it , the price you pay is similar to chipotle , except portions are slightly smaller . still a solid option if you are sick and tired of the giant conglomerate known as chipotle . and you can take your food to eat at union sq park . 
this is kind of the epitome of brooklyn pizzerias . no reservations , cash only , long line out in front , grumpy service , oh , and great pizza . the good news is that you can get a grimaldi ' s pizza in midtown if you don ' t like waiting in the line . apparently there ' s also one in arizona . weird . 
fort defiance . it is so nice to be able to get a great cup of coffee in red hook . not only do they have great coffee , but their sandwiches are oh so tasty . i have tried the muffaletta which is huge and the vietnamese sandwich , which is a nice variation on the classic with bigger badder veggies and rather than a smear of of pate ' its like chunk oh pate ' . i have yet to try their cocktails , but am looking forward to a nice midsummer refreshment very very soon . 
a very disappointing experience , as are most with this type of chain pub . the food is commercialized and unimpressive , and the draft beer tastes strange ( likely due to tap lines that haven ' t been cleaned ) . my latter comment is especially upsetting since the office claims to be a " beer bar " and serves many craft options . serving them from dirty tap lines doesn ' t do them justice , since this completely detracts from the flavor of good craft beer . trivia is fun on thursdays , but i recommend eating and drinking elsewhere . 
i took a friend here for birthday brunch last weekend and it was delicious ! we started off with the bread basket and each got our own entrees , breakfast poutine and ratatouille . ( full review here aspiringgastrognome . blog ) the ambience was cozy and the server was patient and friendly . definitely a place to hit up again , maybe for dinner next time . 
just lovely . the service was phenomenal and i am not even exaggerating . my boyfriend took me here for our two year anniversary . since it was such a special occasion , he whipped out his fancy pair of black sweatpants ( i know , i ' m so lucky ! ) . sweatpants and all , they still gave us the best service ever ! the waiters look like they ' re secret service agents and they know what you need even before you do ! they ' re extremely attentive and super nice and you never have to ask for more water or wine or anything ! it didn ' t hurt that the food was delicious and to die for ! even though we had reservations , we had to wait a bit for our table . . . but unlike most places where you have to uncomfortably stand at a bar and stare at the hostess to make sure she hasn ' t forgot about you . . . there ' s a whole jazz bar on the side where you can sit in an actual booth , sip your wine , enjoy a cheese plate , and listen to live music while you wait . the hostess will know exactly where you are at all times and you don ' t have to worry about loosing your table . if you don ' t want to go all out for dinner you should at least come in for some wine and cheese . it ' s a great place for a date . just come in , grab a booth , have some wine and cheese . . . it ' ll still be the best experience ! great place . 
i had a late lunch with a friend the other day and i loved it . for new york , and chelsea in particular , the pricing was decent and the portions were more than satisfactory . there are no reservations needed for lunch . the staff seated me and despite my friend getting lost and turning up N minutes later they never pressured me to order anything or bothered me much at all . i just had one drink while i waited . the staff was very friendly which is something i find is missing at a lot of places in nyc these days . you never felt ignored but you never felt smothered either . the only real downside to the place was it was a tad loud but it didn ' t interfere with having a conversation at normal volume at your table . overall the place was nicely decorated and with the open doors and outdoor seating it was very light . now , onto the food . i heard the mac and cheese was unmissable and when i realized they had three kinds ( chedder and fontina , smoked gouda and bacon and truffle oil ) i was excited to see they had the " mac attack ! " which was a sample of all three . there was enough to share for the two of us but i could have eaten it all myself it was so good . if you only pick one i recommend the truffle oil . after this i had the watermelon salad and my friend had the shaved artichoke salad . even though they were not an " entree salad " they were more than happy to size them up for an entree . they also added chicken breast to my friends with no problem and only a very small additional cost . for dessert we split the deep fried oreos and peanut butter cheesecake pops . both were great and again in fairly large portions yet not too filling . the end cost for two of us ordering an appetizer , two salads sized up to entrees and two desserts came to a little under N bucks . depending on what you order i would say it ' s great for a quick lunch out or taking someone special somewhere special . will definitely go again . 
let ' s start with the setting . this place is super small , with N tables for dining right above the kitchen . my eyes were watering within the first N minutes due to the concoction of cooking smoke and jerk seasoning in the air . this was a bit overwhelming since there was no place to escape to . i however can overlook the ambience since the food was on and popping . i had the calypso shrimp and honey had the jerk lamb . both truly tasty with a variety of flavors which is a rarity in the jamaican restaurants i ' ve been to . most ja restaurants only flavor is just forehead sweating , mouth on fire , pray before the next bathroom trip , hot . we ' ll be back . 
so i ' ll start off with a disclaimer that if you ' re here on a date and you go on a relatively busy night ( say friday or saturday ) , it can be a little hard to hear yourself because the place will get packed and it ' s not the most spacious restaurant in the world ( probably seats like N people or so ) . the atmosphere is pretty casual ( no tablecloths ) and the servers have always been very friendly each time i came in . however , aside from that , i think everything else about this establishment is done awesomely . the waitstaff is great , friendly , and easygoing the bartender knows his stuff . my problem is that i always go through the eyes-bigger-than-your-stomach phase with appetizers at many places , and it ' s ten times worse for me at kiwiana . i really like the recent addition of fried whitebait . combined with the hot artichoke soup ( it used to be a corn soup but i think the reason they have paper menus is ' cuz they keep changing the menu by the week ) , it makes a good start to any meal . as for the entrees , i have a really hard time deciding what i like second-best in this place . first place is easily the rack of lamb -- i ' ve had lamb at a lot of establishments ( it ' s probably my second favorite food after steak ) but how can you go to a new zealand restaurant and not order lamb ? isn ' t that what the entire freaking country is known for ? i overheard a table next to us saying that the chef grew up on a lamb farm , which totally doesn ' t surprise me . as for my second-favorite entree , it ' s probably a tie between the fried chicken ( no , seriously -- it ' s served with this honey that ' s had truffles infused with it or something , it ' s ridiculously good ) and the lamb burger ( again . . . . new zealand ? lamb ? hello , anyone ? ) . the lamb burger ' s main downside is that i eat it too fast . finally , i ' m not one to really know my wines , but my date seemed to like the savingnon wines that apparently all come from new zealand ? she said their selection was exceptionally good , since i don ' t hear of many other new zealand establishments in new york . also , one last warning brunch gets packed , and is cash-only . ( this is when i always have a really hard time deciding between the steak and the lamb burger . yes , life is really hard . ) 
on a recent visit to nyc i discovered this nice intimate cafe via yelp and i was very impressed . it ' s a cozy cafe on lexington ave with great service ( thanks eric ! ) and their penny egg sandwich was excellent . the egg and pesto was a nice combination and i would definitely go back again . 
we found juventino while aimlessly wandering around park slope , far too early apparently , as most stores didn ' t open until Nam on a sunday . all in all , this is a great spot - definite recommendation to friends visiting ny . very fresh , open space with natural light . i was a little put off by the standoff-ish attitude from the staff , but the smell of freshly pressed coffee was enough to keep me smiling . --- on the table and in my belly huevos rancheros - eggs over easy with mama ' s real home-made tortillas , heirloom beans , N salsas country poached eggs - wilted greens , apricot-chipotle chicken broth , country loaf bread , sesame , watermelon radish and roasted garlic cloves --- i have nothing but praise for both dishes and wish i could bring it back to vancouver to show some brunch places here how it ' s really done . keep on , keep on , juventino . you ' re on my hit list for next time . 
would not go back ! waiter lied about what comes on a seafood dish and then instead of being a man and apologizing he made up another story and never came back to the table . the apps were tiny ! and the grouper special was small too ! guess we weren ' t alone because the table next to us also complained about the portion size and service . save yourself an do not go there ! 
delicious ! ate here every day i was in new york this weekend ! rack of lamb was perfectly cooked and complemented nicely with a side of marinated vegetables . the blueberry salad is bomb ! juicy blueberries , crunchy almonds , and mild soft cheese all give great texture to a very fresh plate of greens . nice wine selection too . the omelet was a solid choice for brunch with a side of bacon and a bloody mary . lovely patio in the back . the staff here is very helpful and friendly . chad gave us excellent recommendations . i can ' t wait to go back and see what they have on the menu next time ! definitely check it out ! 
quirky little hipster burger joint . the food was good and cheap and staff friendly and all seemed to love their jobs and the place . atmosphere is perfect for location and clientele . i really enjoyed my entire experience here right down to the cute little mouse running around the dining room . yes this might bother some people , but those people should probably not be eating on st . marks . 
flatbread is an amazing place which cares about its staff , community and the farmers from which it sources its ingredients . i have been eating there since it opened in N and i have n awesome time everytime i go ! having a drink and bread on the patio is fantastic in the summer and cozying up near the hearth is the best in the winter . year round its my husband and i ' s favorite place for a great , low key dinner ! 
i just had my wedding here saturday august N , N and it was absolutely amazing ! ! ! ! people are constantly messaging me and telling me that it was one of the best weddings they ' ve been to in years if not the best one in their lives . service was beyond exceptional and i could not have asked for a more beautiful wonderful perfect wedding . thank you for everything and making my wedding truly a fairytale steve goodman was the absolute best to work with he was literally my life saver and helped me keep my ( and my now husbands ) sanity . if it wasn ' t for him i would have gone completely out of my mind , but he made sure every little detail was exactly what i wanted and he got back to me always within N hours if not sooner . but i can ' t end without saying that the whole entire staff was also absolutely phenomenal ! i would recommend everyone there for any event ! ! ! ! 
i came here for a friends birthday that was held in the private room and i have to say the service and food was really good . nothing really jumped out at me on the menu , just regular italian fare , but really well done . not one thing i didn ' t enjoy . excellent fried calamari and penne ala vodka ! would definitely hold a party here or just go for dinner for N . or just drinks at the bar . was really pleasantly surprised with this place . 
this restaurant is no longer open . 
i ' ve eaten at all the shanghai places in chinatown and flushing and this place was by far the cleanest and had the best service . we shared an order of the xian long boo ( soup dumplings ) , scallion pancakes , fried rice , a chicken and a duck dish . all were excellent . if you ' re downtown and interested in this type of chinese food , you can ' t do better than shanghai manor . 
i came here on the fact a friend has been here . . . . we came for lunch and it was pretty good . i had the white sangria which was okay ! got the lunch i had the fish tacos , which came with black beans , white rice and plantains . the meal was just okay . here is why my fish was a little spicy than expected and it wasn ' t as flavorful as you think . i would like to come back and try something else . i even like they are kid friendly even tho i didn ' t bring my daughter , i will next time . 
decent bar with " cheesy " jersey cover bands and cold beers . 
this place has the most amazing food ! organic and fresh ! flavors melt in your mouth and all of the food is incredible ! zaggat needs to visit this place ! the place gets crowded and filled up fast , but the bustling and friendly atmosphere makes you feel at home . - michelle
great pizza with amazing service ! 
i love this place . i come here at least once a week to eat . at least first time i came here with my parents , the beef in the water cooked beef tasted spoiled . hence the four not five stars . so stay away from the beef . but everything else is amazing ! ! i keep coming back for double beef in hot oil ( only beef dish i order with cold cuts ) , noodles in hot oil , and the dry sauteed string beans . tried the chengdu chicken today and it was also amazing ! 
this place is terrible . don ' t go there . i am a chinese and i am telling you , you should go to the one in edison , which is much better in prices , quantity and quality . the shanghai bun here is hard to eat . and the boss women has very bad temper , once i was yelled at - certainly she doesn ' t understand the importance of customers . and the food i ordered one time , made my stomach uncomfortable . say again , don ' t go there , if you are looking for shanghai bun , go to the edison one . i am not going there any more
went with a party of N for a birthday . we were not warned of any time limit as most restaurants have no such thing . after about an hour and N minutes , we were warned we may have to get up from our table . we didn ' t think anything of it . at about the two hour mark as we were eating dessert and ordering more drinks , we were told we had to get up to make room for more people . really ? we rack up an enormous bill N dinners , two or three drinks per guest and several desserts and this is how we are treated ? this group will be celebrating occasions elsewhere . 
stopped in late at Npm w da girlfriend make a reservation ! i did and walked past the N ppl waiting for tables , right to our table the food -veal sweetbreads were awesome ! -octopus salad was pretty good too . -rabbit terrine w fennel was sweet tasting , pretty good . -burrata cheese was delicious . -aranchinis were very cheese and served over ragu . solid . -dessert-pana cota w strawberries- absolutely delsih ! best were sweetbreads panacota . the drinks got the house red and it was relish . got the Nml ( half bottle ) for N . not too bad . overall i liked how it was small plates . we did not order a single big entree dish . our server was a little strange and needed to know the dishes better . i would come back . 
firstly the gm here i think his name is arnold always a gentleman always on point . had dinner last week with friends . fab atmosphere , and surprisingly crowded early on a monday evening . started with martinis at the bar , which were perfection ! ! ! we always come here for the burger black label yum ! great service , great food , especially the burger
over price korean fusion food " " 
although this place is here since Ns i only discovered it today . here are the highlights - - yes you can ' t beat the price , a filling breakfast with coffee is less than N . - nice atmosphere , good place to start your day . - food quality is o . k . nothing fancy here people . my experience here is based on breakfast . i came just after they opened and the place was full of people . i was confused when i entered , is it deli style or resturant style . given the huge counter i went there to the cashier who was nice enough to seat me and give me the menu , later the waiter came and took my order . services is fast although the place was packed and only one waiter was working that day . i ordered harvey breakfast , i liked the egg and the sausage , however the potato was not their best . i would come again ? i am not sure , but you better give it a try who knows ! 
so biagetti ' s is a typical west haven family-run italian place . portions are large and the food is great ! last night was the second time i ' ve come here , and both times the service ( or lack thereof ) was severely disappointing . first , it does not take N minutes to bring out our soup and salads . really ? second , the waiters completely forgot our appetizers after they claimed we told the " wrong " server our order . the manager simply came over and stated that we told the wrong server our order so it had never been put through . if the manager was made aware of the situation a ) why were our appetizers unable to make it to the kitchen and b ) why were we not comped an appetizer ? finally , it took an hour and a half to receive our entrees . honestly , while the food is good , it is definitely not worth the wait and lack of service to get it . will be chowing down italian elsewhere . 
the worst pizza i have ever had . it ruined a lovely afternoon stroll through princeton . too bad that my friend who had just returned to nj after being overseas for N years was subjected to an awful pepperoni slice . my sicilian slice was no better . what happened since they moved to the new location . . . . did they leave the recipes and good dough behind ? 
some friends and i went here between games of the women ' s big east tournament . we got there a little after N p . m . people started coming in after us . we got drinks , ordered and waited and waited for our food . other people who came in after were getting served . we kept trying to flag our waiter down who kept saying " soon . " we asked for the manager and was told he was cooking . at N N - an hour after we got there and upon watching people pay and leave , i went to the kitchen to ask to see the manager and again was told he was cooking . i asked the people in the restaurant if anyone else hadn ' t been served . everyone had except one table . eventually the manager came and said there was a computer error . he said he just arrived - our waiter lied - he said our food would be right out . five minutes later my cold french onion soup came . the other order was wrong and the other two never came . at N N we left . we would never recommend this restaurant to anyone . 
i really loved the food at balaboosta . we started off the shrimp kataif which is kind of like a shrimp tempura but has these fine crunchy noodles wrapped around it . it came with a flying fish roe sauce that had a hint of wasabi . for my entree i had the skirt steak which had this delicious rub on it- it could possibly be my most favorite skirt steak i have ever eaten ! i ordered it medium well and next time i will have to order it medium because mine was pretty well done . my boyfriend loved his lamb chops . for dessert , my boyfriend and i shared the chocolate mousse which was delicious . it had homemade whipped cream and at the bottom there was a chocolate rice krispy layer . the part that was discouraging about this meal was that our table was an inch away from the couple next to us so we were practically on a double date . also , the host was kind of rude . we got there maybe N minutes late and he told us he was about to give our table away even though i confirmed the reservation earlier that day . there is no reason to hassle the customers right when they walk in . it turned me off a bit . 
should not be eating the burgers here but sooo tasty ! 
i got a N gift certificate to zahav , and for N weekends in a row , i couldn ' t get a reservation . must be a very good restaurant to be so busy , right ? ok , so i decided to get takeout , just to be able to use the gift certificate . i wish i could upload pictures here , to show you what zahav provides for N - because i did take pictures , so people would believe me . i was so flabbergasted . five miniscule helpings of the dishes i had ordered - the mushroom dish could literally have fitted into a tablespoon ( N ) . rip off ! ! 
we were going to eat at penny cluse but there was an hour and a half wait . being new year ' s day not much was open . you order at the register and they bring your food to the eating bars . this is a small restaurant . they didn ' t have earl grey tea so i had warm hot chocolate . yes , it was warm not hot . the frittata with bacon and fiery peppers and onions was delicious . the hash brown were fresh and wonderful . 
horrible experience ! my bf and i went here based on the yelp reviews and i really questioned yelp and the reviews after our experience . waitress was inexperienced and slow . food some parts were hot and some were cold which means they weren ' t made to ordered . the tacos were reheated and also lack flavor . the taco trucks are far better than this place ! 
full disclosure i ' ve been a regular since the first day ( really ) they opened their doors . while they will never get their mac cheese right and a few of us are still awaiting the day they find another pie lady ( remember the rhubarb pie ? ! ? ! ) this will always be one of my favorite , reliable places to eat in my neighborhood . yes , it ' s in bed-stuy . so it ' s not big as most restaurants here are not . so you will wait for a table during a busy night . and if it is a really busy night , you may way outside . in the cold . in the heat . while people go to the laundry or the pet store next door . enjoy the everyday surprise and characters of the ' stuy while you do . when you do sit down , order the chicken . hot if you like moderately spicy food , extra hot if you want to prove a point to your lower intestine . the georgia brown cocktail ( sweet tea bourbon ) never disappoints as well . other items such as the catfish are good about N of the time , but as with fish at any restaurant , politely ask when it came in . the cuisine is southern coastal and full of the classics collards , corn bread , fried shrimp , etc with a touch of new york to add some contemporary flair . it ' s solid , good food and the chicken really is that great . the bartenders and waiters are all nice , mostly young and local . you will get a mix of ' stuy residents , transplants and tourists . leave your manhattan fine dining and williamsburg artisanal expectations at the door to really enjoy it - this is a tiny , southern neighborhood version of ' cheers ' with good atmosphere and good people . have fun ! for a bigger version , try their sister restaurants peaches or marietta . tips - this is not a place for large groups . - due to size , strollers , etc have been known to literally trap people in out of their seats . 
incredible sandwiches and you can bring beer in to wash it down ! 
as far as the sushi half goes , this restaurant is reasonably priced and a beautiful place to eat at . they have various specials through out the weekdays , including " buy one roll , get one free " on mondays . i am very partial to sushi and not too crazy about hibachi , in general , so i can not speak for the hibachi half of the restaurant . overall , though , the service has always been nice and extremely fast , as well as the food being very fresh and delicious . in an area that ' s lacking nice spots to eat , the opening of this location is delightful . byob . 
i love thai food and have eaten lots of it in my time , from boston to new york to philly and then some . all in all , baan thai is easily the best thai restaurant in philly and certainly one of the best of all the thai restaurants i ' ve tried . for me , consistency is key , and baan thai brings it every single time . we ' ve eaten here probably around N times over the last couple of years and have never been disappointed . the service is impeccable -- friendly , accommodating and fast . they are byob , which is a huge plus for us as we do like our wine very much . and , most importantly , the food is amazing . i crave their red curry and i cannot imagine going there without ordering it , with seafood in my case . i read in a previous review that the fish cakes ( tod mun ) were outstanding and that reviewer was absolutely right . easily the best i have ever had . the firecracker shrimp are also a must-have . other notable appetizers are the calamari ( golden rings ) and the spring rolls . everything i ' ve tried has been wonderful . the sauces served with the appetizers are also delightful and overall effect of the complementary flavors is truly a sensuous experience . my wife always must have the seafood on the flame which is served actually on fire ( part of the allure for her ) and is always delicious . we have brought our son , who is not known for his broad palate or his willingness to try new foods , but he ordered the duck tamarind ( for reasons unknown to me ) and he absolutely loved it . i tried as much as he would allow and it was incredible . we live in the neighborhood so we always eat there which i strongly suggest as nothing beats having the food served to you directly from the kitchen , ( especially the dishes served on fire . . . ) the atmosphere is quaint and very pleasant . a nice bit of romance to it . they have a fountain which quietly bubbles in the corner and usually have some decent background music playing . always clean , always friendly and always quick service . and like i said , i always get what i come for -- consistency . so , overall , not only the best thai food and thai restaurant in the city , but overall one of the best restaurants in the city , period . 
fav spot in the city ! food is sooo good ! its a little small and cramped inside , so make sure you like the person youre going with ! 
only reason i ' m giving N instead of N stars is because i can ' t compare it to any other restaurant in little italy , as this is the only one i ' ve been to . fantastic food . . stopped in here in the last night of our trip and had a great italian dinner . caprese salad was a bit small but high quality . lasagna for two was fantastic . . fresh , hot and delicious . service was also great . . would go again for sure . 
been here twice in N weeks . first time i had the dumplings which were fried and terrific . the second time i had the dumplings boiled and they were even better . the sesame pancake stuffed with duck , cilantro and carrots is fantastic . there is always a line outside the door and for good reason , it great and worth the trip . 
loved it ! we had two pizzas , one with mushroom and pepperoni and the other just plain ( or " boring pie " as the server called it ) . both were wonderful . the mushrooms were so fresh and the pepperoni so juicy and flavorful . the plain pizza let the quality of the ingredients shine in all their simplistic glory . everything , from the crust to the sauce , the cheese to the olive oil , was perfect . the line was actually good because i wasn ' t all that hungry when we showed up but i was by the time we got inside . at one point we were the second of three two-tops in line , and the guy came out and called for a group of N or N . a truly brilliant woman behind us suggested we combine forces and take that four-top ! it probably only saved us about ten minutes of waiting , but those ten minutes would have felt like an hour . 
really not worth the hype . the food is ehhh okay not great ! had the roti canai , it was the best thing i had that night . the pad thai was just not that flavorful they do have a full bar and the atmosphere was nice the wait staff could pay a little more attention but overall its an okay place if you can decide where to eat in the neighborhood but there are a lot more better " hole in the wall " place in the area . you are basically paying for a safe place to eat with many tourist
came in on a wednesday night . the outdoor area was full but we managed to grab seats at the communal table by the bar alongside a few good looking fellow chicken-cravers . the mood was festive and the cocktails were flowing freely . as for the food split a biscuit , the brisket tacos and the kale salad to start . the biscuits alone are worth the price of admission . the butter is jalape o-ed , the jam is delightful and the biscuits themselves practically melt in your mouth . the tacos are also fantastic-none of that bland beef that so often gets passed off as brisket these days . be forewarned , there are only three per order , so you might want to get two orders to prevent conflict among dining compatriots . for my entree i got the chicken and waffles because , honestly chicken and waffles for dinner ? sign me up . the breading on the fried chicken is scrumptious and the waffle was wonderful . it didn ' t last long on my plate , that ' s for sure . the derby is a great addition to the burgeoning lower manhattan fried chicken scene , i will certainly be back ! 
upon my last visit to mamas i discovered they now serve steak souvlaki and home made chicken soup ! needless to say i ran back on here and immediately updtated my review . the steak souvlaki is juicy and charred just like carne asada or skirt steak , needless to say my new favorite choice . . secondly the chicken soup is unreal . exactly like my moms at home . people need to know how legit this soup is because even at the citys best soup spots , some just dont have that home made taste . 
perfect place to grab some drinks and tacos . the restaurant can get crowded sometimes , so be prepared to bump shoulders with a stranger . staff is pleasant and personable and the food is out of this world . i love me some al pastor ! 
i work in the area so we end up here somewhat frequently . it ' s great for post-work drinks and never too crowded , so it works really well for groups . it ' s also cute , bright and quaint inside and has a good vibe . i usually order off of the drinks menu on the blackboard above the bar . i ' ve asked for fairly standard drinks that are not on the menu a few times and the bartenders seem to frequently say that they can ' t for various reasons ( i guess they only really work off of the menu ? ) so i just take the easy way now and order the specials . luckily , the featured drinks are pretty good . 
came here for nye dinner . it was okay food . had the pad kee mao . it was pretty good flavor . friend had the salmon but it was too sweet and sent it back . they till charged her even though she did not eat any of it . half the price at least . they could have waived it . not sure if i would come back here . 
our party of N each ordered different entrees and all were perfectly prepared and enjoyed . my rock fish ( one of my favorites ) was cooked to perfection with a delicious quinoa sauce which did not overpower the fish . the duck meatballs as an appetizer was unique and delicious . we ordered the chocolate souffle with the entree as it takes a while to prepare---what a superb dish ! ! all of our desserts were also delicious . and did i mention that the service was excellent ? our waiter was very attentive and helpful in explaining the wine and dinner menus . i will definitely return . ) 
easy to sum up pretentious , terribly curt service , incredible fish . the decor is beautiful but like the rest of the experience , sterile . not a " fun " experience , and not for big groups , but the fish and the rice is the best i ' ve had . i didn ' t venture to try the cooked dishes ( i think the eel backbone is supposed to be great ) . full disclosure , i haven ' t been there since yasuda left . if you ' re looking for something more relaxed and less pretentious with excellent fish , do gari or seki . kanoyama and sushi azabu downtown are also excellent . if you want something less expensive with many types of fish , i like blue ribbon at columbus circle ( though the rice and service can be variable ) . if you ' re a tourist and want something trendy , go somewhere big and exciting and fusiony with a bar like morimoto or nobu . 
usually order pizza all the time yum yum ! . i just ordered a " plain " yes plain buffalo chicken wrap ! horrible taste ! . i unwrapped it and not sure whats in it . sour taste or something oil , onions , mayo anf not sure what else . yuck . sorry guys . 
great for family outings or a casual dinner . while it has increased in swankiness since its renovation a few years ago , it ' s still a great place to see a celeb in their sunday , roll-out-of-bed garb , or to get some of the best comfort food in the city . and save room for dessert . the pies are what this place is all about . de-lish ! 
lovely drinks but come on god sake we are in lower east side lower the prices little bit haa ) other than that good food and ok atmosphere ( for single female not so good ) 
hands down best cocktail spot around . donny ( bearded man with hipster flare ) makes such amazing cocktails it ' s crazy . i wont order a fresh daiquiri unless he ' s working . on top of the rare cocktail expertise of this crew . . . the finger foods are soo amazing i ' ve asked for the recipe of the pretzel beer fondue more than N times . apparently it ' s a secret . . . . that keeps me coming back for more
definitely a unique experience with large , wide cut belgian fries and a wide variety of dipping sauces . we got three sauces mango chutney , vietnamese pineapple , honey mustard , and of course ketchup . while the fries are fresh and served ( very ) hot , the dipping sauces didn ' t really taste spectacular . in fact , they were just average tasting and didn ' t really make a big difference . the restaurant itself is kinda dingy looking with very limited seating . our table was dirty with a spilled drink and fries ! it ' s not a great place to bring friends - not even sure you wanna hang out there with just two people . it ' s an interesting concept , nonetheless . 
ever since the first time i tried l b square slices , i can ' t have enough . it is the type of food that you want to keep eating no matter how full you are just because of how good it tastes . i can ' t even eat pizza at other pizzerias because i ' m just so in love with l b . hands down best pizza in brooklyn . always freshly made pleasant staff . i love l b ! 
always heard good things about the place . to be honest , didn ' t really care for the shrimp and grits after the first two bites . the beer battered fish and chips was not bad at all but the bread pudding dessert tasted old . overall it was ok . . . i just was not wowed like others . maybe brunch next time ) service was good except for adding on extra tip they decided to add on after our exit for a table of two . 
like most new haven mexican food establishments , geronimo is overrated . i ' ve never walked away from a meal here thinking , ' man , that was a good and satisfying meal . i ' d like to come back sometime . ' never . usually i ' m coerced here as a result of ' bar is too crowded on a saturday night ' or ' well at least they have decent drinks ' situation which never ends well in my book . the made to order guacamole is good but at N a pop , you ' d better bring some friends . also , they claim that it is table side but then they make it somewhere else in the dining room . so don ' t call it table side if it ' s not at my table ' s side and i ' m paying for the show . also , i ' ve made the mistake of ordering the tuna tartare tacos twice . twice . either that , or i had a bad d j vu where i put a mushy , mealy unidentifiable mound of mayonnaise-doused fish ( ? ) in my mouth . i mean , seriously ? ? this has got to be a culinary crime somewhere . at least sear fresh tuna and dice it up with some citrus . don ' t give me canned cold tuna tossed in mayonnaise and try to pass it off as something worth N . just take it off your menu ! ! i ' ve also ordered the soup trio ( which comes in tiny ramekins - hardly constituting a meal ) , and a burrito ( oversized and clearly overcompensating ) . my dining companions didn ' t seem as offended by their menu choices as i did , but i certainly didn ' t hear any sounds of approval either . in short - you do not come for the food . you come to drink , and for the " scene . " 
food is ok but the waitress is like don ' t bother and why don ' t to pay the same price and same kind of foods with good service that i can dine in at sushi king with only N miles away . 
yum . yum . 
pretty good but did not have an extensive list of wines . pizza was good though nothing too special . i ordered the stache , it was an untraditional mix of flavors for me . service was ok , although the waitress seemed annoyed if you didn ' t order something else every time she came by . 
decided to stop by on a late wednesday night ( N Npm ) . i was with one other friend and we were told there would be a N minute wait , which seemed long at that hour on a weeknight . we each ordered a beer at the bar , and actually got seated upstairs right away . once upstairs , as loud and crowded as the place seemed , it had a really cozy feel to it-- esp that we were seated near a semi-private little nook . we ordered the appetizer special- chicken liver chorizo ( a little spicy and amazingly delicious i am a chicken liver fan to begin with ) . a yummy appetizer to go with our speckled hen beer ! we shared a rabbit entree ( so glad the waitress did not give us any wierd looks about sharing it was late evening and we did not feel like a " full " dinner ) . rabbit was very moist and tender . overall , the food was good , and the atmostphere great-- an energetic , happy crowd . i ' d probably avoid this place on the weekends , as i can imagine how long the wait would be , esp with larger groups . 
eataly is one of those shiny new destinations that you just have-to-do because it ' s different and you ' ve heard so much about it . it ' s magical as far as grocery shopping goes - polished , smells delicious , endless miles of shelves with celebrity-chef-approved , gourmet italian ingredients . as far as dining in , it ' s a little odd , but that ' s because . . . you ' re in the middle of a grocery store . but you knew that going into it . it ' s a fun experience and the pasta is good . we ate in the pasta-specific section - apparently there are several different dining locations with a fancier option upstairs , which i ' d like to go back to try . bucatini al amatriciana , my favorite pasta dish which i can rarely find , was on the menu , and it delivered . 
indian hut makes the best hydrabadi chicken dum biryani . i have not tried that high quality biryani anywhere else . i have tried they hydrabadi chicken dum biryani and goat biryani both were excellent . i normally order N to N times in week never disappointed . great food and good service . highly recommend . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
i love eating brunch here . everything is great except , i don ' t know if this was just a bad day , but when i went the bloody mary was beyond disgusting . no one in the whole restaurant could finish their bloody mary . it tasted like the bartender squeezed a full lemon and added soap to my drink . 
mmmmm sangria . 
i am hosting a play date and i have a house full of children - all boys and all hungry ! so i order a pizza and chicken alfredo . an hour and N minutes later my food arrives . i ask the driver this food took an hour and N minutes to be delivered . he stood there and replied " its not my fault ! " really ? to add insult , the food was cold ! save your money and worries and buy pizza from someplace else . 
went to the grand opening of kickshaw today and it didnt disappoint ! although the line was all the way to the door , i really enjoyed myself there . i got the gouda gouda , with toasted brioche , black bean hummus , sweet guava jam , and tangy pickled jalape os . my gf got the mozzarella and shredded cheddar sandwich . i really liked my gouda sandwich . i love the mix if the salty cheese with the sweetness of the jam . the mozz cheddar was also great . super thick bread with gooey cheese . the one thing i didnt like all too much was the bread . it felt like it was dipped in butter . i love butter and you definitely need it on the outside of the bread so it gets nice brown and crunchy . but both of our sandwiches were transparent from all the butter . it was way too greasy . the is the only thing i didnt like about our sandwiches . i am definitely a fan and plan on going back time and time again for my grilled cheese fix . i hope they lessen the use of butter just a tad bit . hopefully , they will add some savory items to the menu . i can just picture a hot grilled cheese with some pulled pork or some other tasty meat in it . that would be awesome . 
i wanted to love it . potentially great concept . . . execution . . . just ok . our party of N tried every available meatball and i ' d eat all again , but wouldn ' t go out of my way to get any of them . if you find yourself in the area after midnight , you could definitely do worse , but to pass this off as one of the best things going in the city is wrong . . . very , very wrong . 
the hype is not hype . hoagie haven is for real , churning out simple sandwiches that focus on their core ingredients and do not try to be fancy . at lunchtime on the saturday of spring break , the place was still full of students and other locals , ordering and moving aside so as not to block the flow . the place has a working man ' s feel to it , but there is an order in motion here that might take a return visit or two to fully grasp . i felt as if i was in the way more than once , holding up the line and therefore coming between men and their hoagies . a friend and i decided to pick two and split them for a little variety . we were surprised by the sheer size of each beast . almost two feet in length , a tremendous value for the price . the hot pastrami ( N . N , large ) was stuffed full of delicious strips of meat . i found it a little strange that he asked if i wanted mayonnaise , but the sandwich was eventually delivered with a beautiful and biting mustard that complimented the pastrami perfectly . the breads were fresh and delivered from nearby italian peoples bakery , thrown into their over for good measure to make sure everything was toasty . more toppings confusion ensued with the chicken parmesan ( N . N , large ) , which somehow ended up with lettuce , tomatoes , and onions . those were easily removed though and the delicious crispy fried chicken and sharp cheese shined . the sauce was used sparingly , and i think anymore would have completed disentigrated the bread before we could eat it . i would have loved to have asked for some more on the side though , as it was one of the best parts . 
great artichoke pizza and crab pizza ! ! ! ! ! ! 
love love love me some abbaye . in a neighborhood flowing with foodie favorites the abbaye has found a way to stand out in the crowd . their vegan options are untouched in the area , weekly specials menu is never missed , and their nachos are the best in the city ! i know i know , nachos are the same everywhere . no , the abbaye takes N layers of cheese and bakes them all individually . one cheesy bite after another will send you taste buds into nacho bliss . mussels with pancheta , onions , and crusty local bread are also a local favorite . if you ' re into the whole craft beer thing , be sure to stop in for one of the N beers on tap ! 
i visit this place every time i ' m in philly . big portions and great service ! ask to sit outside if it ' s nice out
i ' m not a fan of ny style pizza and since my friend wanted to try the flat , ny style that i ' ve come to think as just ' meh , ' i needed a good representative of it so that i didn ' t throw the results . lombardi ' s was nearby and with it being the ' first ' pizzeria why not ? we waited for a little bit at the bar with some obnoxious people who wouldn ' t move despite the fact that they were closing their tabs . we got called and they ' offered to take our drinks ' which was super confusing at first but we were seated in the other area that required us to walk out and into another door which meant we couldn ' t carry open containers of alcohol . we sat down , ordered the large cheese-since ny style seems like it ' s a plain cheese slice . when the pizza came , my friend said he was from out of town and if this was pizza that was typical of ny style . despite the high pedigree i thought it was just okay pizza , nothing too extraordinary but decent . i ' m awarding N star because with a large cheese and a soda they charged us N bucks and some change , which was about N bucks over the total . we flagged our waitress down and she said " no , it was the right price . " when we asked to see the menu to double check the numbers she went to ' check ' on our bill again and said it was N and some change handed us our correct change and then walked away without any apology . is this how staff treat people who they think are tourists or visitors ? if so , i would stay away . seriously , why bother with the wait when all you ' re going to do is end up getting screwed over by servers ? 
i very much delighted in my meal at this establishment on my most recent holiday in philadelphia . i ordered a pizza pie that was cooked to perfection . it was quite delicious ! 
i have to make a stop here every time i visit nyc ! the corn is to die for ! i usually get the strip steak as an entree . . always a good choice . i ' ve also had the chicken dish with saut ed spinach , the shrimp dish and the huevos rancheros which were all pretty good too . the place is a bit tight but service is generally good . definitely recommend coming here even just to try the corn ! 
excellent roast beef sandwich . . . . the gravy is sick . . . i want to bath in it . 
as a good mexican i have a picky palate for mexican food , but i ' m very pleased with my visit to barrio chino ! my interest became when i saw it featured at the foodnetwork , so i had to give it a try ! i loved the concept ! i tought it was cute keeping all the chinese decoration but as a surprise you have amazing mexican food . it makes you enjoy the food even more and appreciate every single flavor out of it . i had to wait an hour for a party of two , that was bit a turnoff , but the staff is very nice , and even when the kitchen was bit slow due to major crowdness , our server made sure we were ok and let us know about the bit delay . personal touch , is how i would call it . guacamole . . . well , i think the best guacamole is the one that you can make in your house ! this was great , but was missing a bit hint of lime and i would use different avocados but overall was good . i had margaritas , well . . . two to be exactly ! and to be honest . . . were amazing ! the flavor was so fresh , and the hint of the spicy margarita was so delicious ! i would go back just for the margaritas ! my friend asked for tacos arrachera , which were very good , but didn ' t top my order enchiladas de mole . . . . oh well , that mole . . . gave me a flashback back home when my nanny prepared it with a paste that was sent by her family in puebla , which is the city where mole is from . if i didn ' t lick the plate was because i have manners , but i resist myself to do it . desserts are good and cheap , i wish i could have tried the churros , but hopefully next time ! barrio chino is a must in my list now ! just be prepared that you have to wait a bit . . . the rest is amazing ! 
this place is really good . the ambiance is more than beautiful and really interesting . food is also really good . i ate scallops and my bf ate ribs-both of the dishes were amazing . you should definitely go there . 
love the desserts here . haven ' t tried anything else , but frankly , all i need want are their desserts . quaint , charming japanese-style decor . equally charming and delicious asian-style desserts with a modern western twist . my absolute favorite is the black sesame creme brulee , which comes with a scoop of black sesame ice cream . will definitely be back ! ! 
very good food i would love to go back and try other dishes on the menu i really enjoyed the humus , califlower , and falafal meatballs they were really well seasoned and fresh . the service was a little slow but thats ok they will get into the groove the longer they are there i think the kitchen is beautiful very clean and airy and exposed which is great because it forces clean and sanitary behavior . 
this place is the best thin crust pizza place i ' ve ever been to . came here at N p . m . on a sunday afternoon and still could get a table for two which we were thrilled . we ordered their classic pie with meatballs on top and we loved it . we also ordered a small black and white tagliatelle with seafood and we loved that too . the crust is thin and not burn . i didn ' t find the bottom of the pie to be wet like we did at grimaldi ' s . the ingredients that they used were fresh . no complaints and just two thumbs up for excellent food i had . you can ' t just come here without ordering a pie . and yet this restaurant is so easy to get too . i know i will come back again soon when ever i go shopping in the neighborhood . one thing i forgot to mention is that i am into N ' s songs and they play them . 
have been going for years . love the unlimited pasta of the day special
i ordered the chicken wings , mac , greens . . the chicken was great . the mac wasn ' t so good . the noodles were overcooked too oily cheap cheese . the greens i was disappointed i had more stem in my platter then the leaf . the cornbread tho was great sweet soft i only suggest they give it out warm not room temp or cold
on my way to paris , to avoid doing two red eye flights , i broke the trip in nyc and spent two days there . my friend i was travelling with took me out to dinner at this quaint japanese restaurant called katsu-hama . it was heaven on earth . my first taste of japanese food ever , eons and eons ago was tonkatsu and ever since then , i would always order tonkatsu when i don ' t feel like being adventurous . i have had tonkatsu from japanese restaurants all over the world but i have to say that the katsu set at katsu-hama was the best i ' ve ever had . the pork was really yummy and tender , the shrimp was nice and the crab croquette was creamy and delicious it was to die for . i ordered an apple shochu and also tried the peach one . . . both were very nice . . . party in my mouth ! i ' m sure to go back to this place next time i am in nyc . simply the best ! 
went here for brunch today was very very happy . the veggie gorditas were delish my hard-to-please dining companion exclaimed " these are the best veggie tacos i ' ve ever had " about his dish . if you are in a hurry , don ' t eat here . go when you have time to relax enjoy the care put into a proper home-cooked meal . nice array of mexican wines fresh juices but really looking forward to them getting a liquor license ! will go again , N . 
amazing dominican cuisine ! i highly recommend the rotisserie chicken family combo or the pernil . they are both super tender and seasoned to perfection , they have generous portions that comfortably serve approximately N adults and two children teens . the owner is really friendly and accommodating . the sauce for the chicken is amazzzzzzzzzziiiing . this restaurant just opened up a couple days ago and i ' ve been there twice already . i will definitely make this a regular take-out option . N stars in my book . 
if you like decent cheap thai food then this is the place to go . . . . . but beware if you are prone to heart burn . . . . . . then be careful the food is greasy ! ! ! ! ! 
first and foremost , the interior is tremendous and whoever designed the inside of this restaurant has an eye for good taste . secondly , the staff treated me like i was royalty with the way they took the time to explain the whole menu to me in depth and explained everything to me . they have a new item called sauce and toss which includes N wishbone wings dipped in delicious asian sesame soy sauce and topped with fresh herbs which was hands down delicious to the point where i ordered N orders of it . their classic dark and white meat hit the spot , it is very juicy and tender , it makes you not wanna stop eating and every dipping sauce was ordered that day which complimented the chicken tenders . as for pastries , the italian and bananas foster pie definitely hit the spot after eating such wonderful food , kudos to the employees and owners of this place for providing such wonderful service and mouthwatering food , keep up the good work ! ) 
communal seeting was off-putting upon entry but food is delicious and the waitstaff is attentive and nice- no snooty hipsters here . the owner was present and charming , giving us some gratis sake and talking about his love of food . . . . just like an old world restaurant . loved the sense of family in the place- you would think you were at grandmas house . 
i had a very up and down experience with amada , but somehow it all evened out at a N N rating . here ' s the scoop . at long last i made the pilgrimage to the jose garces tapas spot known as amada . i came as part of philadelphia restaurant week , as i usually do to spare my wallet , with a motley crew of five friends for lunch . we were quickly seated at one of their two indoor window-side tables , which i should note sat on a bed of stones . i ' m not kidding , it was like a little zen garden , but without the bonsai and water . this proved somewhat uncomfortable in my dress shoes , but i soon forgot it . on top of that , it was a very sunny day , so the bright september sunshine was a bit overbearing over the course of the meal . now to the food . i wisely followed yelp reviews to help guide my choices . the glowing reviews for the manchego cheese had me convinced , and i was not let down . the lavender honey went good with everything - the bread , the cheese , the apple slices - and i was in complete bliss . unfortunately , the two entree tapas did not match the appetizer in quality . the first , the chorizo , came out slightly overcooked ( read blackened ) , and was pretty tough to chew . the second , the calamari , was much better . though the first few bites were rather bland , the dish got better with more mouthfuls , which rarely happens with me . the tapas i sampled from my friends got mostly positive reviews as well , the hanger steak in particular , but the patatas were fairly average . dessert was a sort of saving grace for the meal , ending it on a high note just as it started . the spanish custard set off every taste bud in my mouth , and made me forget my mild disappointment with the chorizo . overall , i felt that the food was a bit underseasoned . it may just be that i am not familiar enough with spanish food and am accustomed to more spice in my food . there was also some variability of portions that left my friends and i competing to see who would get the most food overall . nonetheless , amada was a positive experience for my party , and i will be more than willing to give it another go . 
not a good experience . long wait for barely polite service , poor food . waiter forgot to bring appetizer until after mains . summer rolls were bland and had cucumber skins sliced up in them , gross hard texture and bitter flavor . pho was bland , nothing special . there are much better vietnamese places in the city . this one is a tourist trap . 
love love love the dumplings ! came to new york chinatown and had a lot of amazing food . this was at the top of the list . i got it to go because it was so packed and it came out to be like little over N for N dumplings . delicious . so juicy , the meat is soft and they even give you that steamed lettuce that i enjoy with it to sop up the juices ! 
this is where sushi and gastro meet ! the quality of the fish is spectacular ! but on top of that you will try it with experimental spices , herbs , sauce like nowhere else ! other than the fish , the pork belly is very tasteful and the fried chicken is the only one i can eat ! 
i ' ve been here several times , cause i ' m fat . and it ' s cheap food that taste good . i ' ve had the wonton noodle soup twice with fried dumplings . i usually add the hot oil sauce to give it a little more taste . that ' s the best sauce in the whole damn place . unfortunately i went in after N and they had no fried dumplings . so i had the boiled dumplings . damn , i had to be a bit healthy . they weren ' t that great but the pork tasted the same . also had the pork bun . . . it was meh . pork was good , outside was basic . like bimbo white bread . minus one star because a fly sat on my last dumpling , and i refused to eat it . and there ' s no fried dumplings after Npm . . . on a saturday . 
just tried the new almond latte . . . almond milk . . a little syrup . . . . perfect . . great place to relax and enjoy treats . . great glueten free items ! 
what a great lunch spot on a chilly , winter day ! the place is huge so there was no waiting for a table . there ' s a large selection of udon and or rice bowls . the food was made and served very quickly . i ' ve been eating a lot of ramen and pasta lately so i wasn ' t in the mood for more noodle . instead , i tried the beef bowl today and loved it . the proportion was huge so i had leftovers for dinner . 
it ' s good . N . N stars . i eat here a lot so don ' t take my N stars as it being asi asi . i think i ' m just getting desensitized to tasty msg chinese food delights in chinatown so you really need to differentiate yourself to wow me now . it ' s a new year . . . time for tighter yelp standards haha . ok , maybe tasty hand pulled noodles isn ' t laced with msg like many other c-town joints . . . it ' s actually a pretty healthy N bowl of noddle soup . but i suppose it ' s a little bland at times . overall i am a fan though . i always come here for lunch great on a cold winter day . and the little tiny cramped place on c-town ' s historic doyers st . is always crowded . you never have to wait too long though , N-N minutes at the most . and it ' s the cheapest place , even in c-town . when you do get a seat ( and you might share ) , you hear the boom boom boom , tap tap tap , bang , bang , bang going on in the kitchen . what is that you say ? why , that ' s the chef banging on the tasty hand pulled noodles . you bang , you pull and voila- noodles are born . the noodles taste really fresh and al-dente , and at times , can even be stuck together , a lingering sign of their doughy origination . ( gah . ) the hand pulled noodles you can get via soup or just stir-fry . i ' ve taken my parents here once and my dad got the stir-fry , it was unbelievably greasy . so i usually go for the soup . . . the roasted duck ( which is a lot of bone fat , not meat , so i don ' t recommend . . is a little hard to eat ) , and the fish ball . i prefer the fish ball because it ' s easier to eat than duck . . . and really because of process of elimination ( i don ' t eat beef ) . however , if you do , you might want to get that because my bf always does and he says it ' s pretty flavorful . the broth itself is a little bland and watery . . . but you can spice it up with some chilli oil , and they always put in nice , fresh greens . with fish ball , i get spinach . . . with beef , i guess you get bok choy ( so i ' ve observed ) . i don ' t get the logic . most soups come with scallions but you can put a whole heaping because they ' re on the table . along with hot sauce fav , sriacha , and various rice vinegars and soy sauces . note make sure you tell the waitress you want ( insert meat here ) noodle soup , one time i made the mistake of just saying " fish ball " soup and alas got soup sans noodles . i don ' t see the logic in that but ok . also , you never know what you ' re going to get with the fish balls . i open them , and sometimes there ' s pork meat in the middle ( gah ) and sometimes they ' re just solo . . . which i prefer . the fish balls are good though , soft , and not too salty . most soups run you Nish dollars or so . . i think there might have been a mild price hike from N . N or some cents but it ' s still cheapo . the unsung hero of tasty handpulled noodles though , are the dumplings . get them as a starter- they come either steamed or fried ( i always get steamed to be healthy ) , with chicken or pork ( me , chicken ' cept last time when they ran out ) . they ' re the real authentic kind your mom makes ( well , at least my mom does ) - with thin wrappers , pinched edges , and fresh grounded meat and scallion rolled by hands . not like the doughy americanized kind you see at say . . dumpling man . you get N ( or N ? ) for N . N . mixed that shizzle with some sriracha , soy sauce and chili oil ? pure and utter yum . service is fine . they speak english pretty well , well because this noodle soup has expanded to the american circle of food due to some ny mag and nft guides . . ( yes all patrons i do see . . . including a group of folks who brought some wine for lunch . byob , who knew ? ) . they should try leaving a pitch of water on the table but the tiny styrofoam cups left much to be desired but you can usually flag someone down . i do love that they leave you a pot of oolong tea though . . . real chinese style . i sip that even on a summer day . is it the best place ever ? no but it ' s a solid go-to lunch spot in c-town when you ' re trying to be light on the dim sum . go . 
this place used to get N stars from me . definitely not anymore . their food is great in-person , and they ' re nice people , but when i order delivery , i expect the same high quality food and service . i don ' t want a pizza that is impossible to eat because of poor delivery . i don ' t want mozzarella sticks that are raw , crushed , and have all the marinara sauce from the container spilled all over them . i don ' t want to pay for extra cheese just to get a terribly saucy and cheeseless pizza . come on , del rossi ' s ! you ' re so much better than that in-person . why can ' t you do the same for delivery ? ? ? 
if it weren ' t for our jarring experience with service last night , this place would have been without a doubt N stars . we ' ve been here before , where food was impeccable , and service blew us away . it was the most chill group of guys and considerate to boot . realized the mountain of food we ordered and helped us move to a larger table . ----last night was a complete N to shit---- my boyfriend and i wanted to celebrate our last day of vacation with one of our favorite meals . it ' s hard enough for us to get the same time off with him working chef hours , so this experience was overwhelmingly awful . along with N friends , we were really looking forward to a bunker blowout N Npm , we were told it would N-Nmins for a table . no problem . guy was nice enough to even point out potential tables that were wrapping up . Nmins later , tables still sitting on their checks , texting , and no one came out to check on us or even offer menus . we continued to wait patiently though , salivating over the idea of food . around an hour , i finally walk in to ask how much longer since it ' s nearing Npm , when they close . same host guy from earlier meets me , walks out with me , and tells us he ' s going to take our order now since the kitchen is closing . we ' re staring dumbstruck at this guy . how does he expect us to order when we haven ' t even seen menus ? haven ' t even been offered drinks . so he brings a few menus out , then says nonchalantly and quite impatiently , " you have N mins " . i ' ve never been more furious and insulted from any dining experience . to have waited patiently and even initiated checking in to be considerate of the kitchen , this was the rudeness we received in return . we were so uncomfortable , that even after waiting for over an hour , we left . it ' s never been truer in that moment how a place can leave a bad taste in your mouth . 
came here for dinner last night , and yes it lives up to the hype . they make excellent dumplings ! we had two servings of the soup dumplings and one serving of the fried dumplings , an order of spring rolls and some singaporean noodles with beef . the place is a bit dive-y and very busy , but hey we are in china town and everything was tasty and very affordable , so two thumbs up ! 
yummy french food and an even more awesome atmosphere . this place recently opened but i think once word starts buzzing this place will be packed . they have lots of seating - so great place for a group of friends . great wine selection and a very friendly and attentive staff . food was yummy - started with the chicken wings and oysters . i had a salmon special and my husband had the french stew with mashed potatoes . dessert we had an ice creamy thing of nougat which was delicious . we don ' t eat a ton of french food but we might have to start since we will be coming back here . also great since it ' s closer to path . 
unless someone else is picking the venue , i generally don ' t go to places where i anticipate having a less than N-star experience . ( why would i willingly spend my hard earned money on second-rate anything ? ) sadly , it happened here . this place is always packed whenever i pass by -- both on weeknights and weekends -- so i had high hopes for cocoron . plus , the reviews for their original les location are stellar ( almost N reviews with a N . N rating ) . a little before Npm this past friday night we were told it would be a N minute wait for two . good thing we didn ' t stray and find a bar to kill time , because it ended up being something like N minutes . no lie , the host does not take phone numbers , so snooze you lose ! the first dish i ordered was god awful . i don ' t recall the exact name , but it was one of the cold veg options , and there were mushrooms . nowhere did it say fish in the description , yet my bowl reeked . absolutely wretched . so i sent it back and ordered something completely different- the pork kimchee dip soba ( hot ) . now this is what i had expected . fantastic ! just N delicious , and i didn ' t want it to end . so why the N stars ? they still charged me for the first dish which i did not eat . never have i ever heard of a place that would do this . yes , i ordered poorly . but what is one N bowl of cold noodles to you , cocoron ? nothing . you could ' ve thrown me a bone . 
i went here last night with my boyfriend , his brothers our group of friends after a trip to the bar . it was about N in the morning and some comfort food was needed . this was my first time seeing mac attack and it was a bright first introduction . the place is decorated in shades of yellows and oranges - all colors that are meant to just wake you up . upon looking at the menu i was at a loss at what to choose . i ' m not really a mac and cheese lover so i let my boyfriend and his brother pick out what to get . they decided on fried mac and cheese balls ( which we got the last of ) , a grilled cheese , the original mac and cheese , and the burger mac and cheese . these names are probably different on the menu . haha . we waited in their lounge area for about N minutes for our food to be done . we took it to go to enjoy at home and boy , was it enjoyed . the fried mac and cheese was delicious with the addition of one of their sauces that i don ' t remember was called . it was orange if that helps ! the mac and cheese entrees were equally mouth watering as well . everything was cooked to perfection . this is a definitely great spot for a bite to eat . my mac and cheese favoring has gone up because of them . 
from the outside it doesnt look like much but when you walk in its actually quite a large restaurant . since it was busy we decided to sit at the bar and eat as we were hungry . i could see the staff were very busy , but they did well to take our orders as the girls behind the bar were serving drinks and food ! they needed a pay rise ! the food was great here , i wanted to go back but we ended up at other places . i would recommend eating here . simple but tasty food that is well priced . 
delightful . charming . great food . service wonderful . it is a gem to find a unique spot that makes you know that special still lives somewhere in ny . . . at the hourglass tavern
i ' ve been here twice so far . you basically get a sheet of paper containing a list of a plethora of fixins for your burger . you check off all the toppings you like ( however , the majority of these toppings are not free ! ) on my first trip here i got a bacon cheeseburger w cheddar on a brioche bun and onion strings . the burger was really delicious and the onion strings were very tasty but just too greasy . on my second trip i got the veggie burger w jack cheese and a side salad . the burger was okay ( i ' ve had better veggie burgers elsewhere ) . i also ordered the virgin birthday cake shake . it tasted exactly like a vanilla shake ( i was expecting more of a cake-like taste especially since the menu said they use actual cake mix ) . i have to say , as good as the cheeseburgers are , it is just too expensive . they really nickel and dime you . i don ' t see this location lasting long if the prices don ' t change . 
dear diary , this is the kind of taco i would make at home for myself i . e sloppy , tasteless , vaguely mexican . worst of all it tastes like all the ingredients were from costco . vegetarian taco was useless . guac was ok- but the tortilla chips tasted very gourmet like and msg-enhanced aka no buen . if it wasn ' t for the unlimited dosage of chipotle mayo and the N other corn syrup sweetened sauces , i probably would not be coming back , ever . 
overpriced food that was not fresh and quite salty . the sourdough bread served was stale . the " crispy asian calamari " was anything but crispy and sat under the lights for far too long before being served . " butternut squash soup " was the soup of the day and was too sweet as an app . server did not cite the specials , we were fortunate to have overheard another server citing them to another table to even know what they were . for such a fancy atmosphere , the service was pathetically slow and sloppy . i think we detected a few fake accents as well , i mean . . . please . 
i ' ve never been to the real islands , and i am no expert on jamaican cuisine , but the food this restaurant makes is pure , home-cooked love . ' tis was the first saturdays night at the brooklyn museum , and we needed serious food to last us til closing time . my friends wanted sushi , but why even think of sushi when there are so many exciting options around ? we stopped by " the islands " , and the aroma coming from the kitchen made us salivate . there was one free table upstairs , and a long quasi-philosophical conversation was had while we waited and waited for our food . the jerk chicken , curry chicken and curry goat were excellent fresh and flavorful . rice and peas were to die for , and completely worth the wait . on top of it , their bathroom is super clean and stocked with " method " hand soap and candles ( no N-cent store stuff ! ) , which is a nice surprise , given its N . N floor in " being john malkovich " feel . 
tthe food was excellent ! ! ! the ravioli with pink sause was perfect . everything was fresh . spaghetti was cooked just right . prices were on point . good portion sizes . teas are not free refills though . oh , if you don ' t like real calamaria don ' t get it here . they litterally just sliced it into big chunks and grill it . didn ' t really liked it . we were going to definately pay for it cause we ordered it , but they saw we didn ' t like it and just took it off with out us asking . didn ' t realize they took it off until we saw a big red smiley face on the check where the price should have been . the wait staff never came over unless we made eye contact . great service ! even better food . 
i think doma is terrific . the space is clean and attractive , and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable . the menu is extensive and the food is delicious and beautifully presented . one of my very favorites is the korean taco . scrumptious ! most important , doma has the best sushi i have ever tasted in philadelphia . go , you will not regret . 
a very schnancy , fancy korean place . service is impeccable , maybe even suffocating . they are there to fold your napkin if you leave your seat and always around . although we had a problem finding someone to get our check at the end of the meal . ordered a la carte and all the dishes were excellently prepared . skip the cremeux dessert . a lot of attention to detail and they will even print you a special message on the menu if you let them know what you are celebrating in advance . 
veeery average food . not terrible though . i have eaten in and ordered out a few times and have never been blown away by their food . i would skip it unless there ' s no other option . 
terrible food . a salmon and shrimp were spoiled and smelly , but they tried to hide the smell and improve a taste with a lot of salt and pepper . got poisoned , and spent a few hours at home with nausea and ( sorry my french ) vomiting . 
this place is obviously very good . all you need to know that is the N to N minute wait times on weekend evenings . aside from chavella ' s up the street , that ' s pretty much unheard of on franklin ave . the menu has not changed much in the year or so since they ' ve opened . i can respect limited menus that concentrate on a few great items , but there ' s a fairly limited vegetarian selection . i ' ll not need another appetizer with the roasted peppers and burrata on the menu , and the white bean pesto is also excellent , but the pizzas on the menu , as well as every special they have , seem to be geared for the carnivore . also , it ' s the best designed restaurant in the ' hood , by far . unless there ' s a loudmouth sitting next to your table ( not barbie ' s fault , but it does attract its fair share for some reason ) , all sections of the restaurant are comfortable . they did an excellent job that justified the wait for its opening . 
N . you can ' t beat the location for parc-part of its success N . they make a great old fashioned cocktail and theres some coziness at the bar N . buy a loaf of bread there and eat it hot on the way home-amazing ! N . tuna carpaccio is rubbery-had it twice and it needs some work . N . the rittenhouse park view and people watching are a must . 
great intimate , cozy spot ! we went here for brunch on a sunday . the food was great . my husband said the nook burger was the best he ever had . john ( i think that was his name ) was an awesome host server concierge . the atmosphere is very welcoming and when you add byob , well that makes this a come back to spot . rememeber to bring a great bottle of vino and cash because they don ' t accept credit cards . 
excellent , delicious food and wonderful service . we were in a hurry and they accommodated . the only reason for N s is the price . it ' s so much . 
what can i say about cafe habana , except perfection ! this tiny little cafe packs a lot of punch into their teeny tiny little space . everything from the music , the decor , and the staff was perfect . the entire staff that works there are extremely gracious hosts and make you feel right at home from the moment you step inside . i managed to take a few pictures of the deliciousness before i had to put the camera away and just enjoy the food . what you are looking at here are two of their amazing appetizers , grilled corn , mexican style , with chili pepper , lime , and cojita cheese ! this is the best corn i have ever tasted ! and of course i could not pass up the tostones , which my mom makes a mean version of as well ! lots of delectable items on the menu to chose from , please go there some time ! ! ! ps- i have cross-posted this review on my blog . and was linked from their blog which you should also check out cafehabanablog . wordpress 
love this neighborhood cafe ! the food , service and drinks are always great ! 
this place may be my new favorite restaurant in the city . i have a newfound love of oysters , and proposing my masters thesis seemed like the perfect reason to celebrate . the boy and i came here , and sat at the bar while waiting for a table . the bartender was awesome , and helped me pick out a cocktail that wasn ' t too girly . big ups to st . germaine . we ended up sitting at the raw bar , watching them shuck , which was a fun distraction . the oysters were super yummy . the famed lobster bisque was great , but being a new england seafood snob , i ' ve had better . but the chunk lobster meat was divine . i had crab cakes , which were also v . good , and the boy got some creole cajun shrimp thing that was spicy awesomeness . a little pricy , sure , but i was rolling home at the end of the night . so . good . 
very nice . a must-try for adventurous eaters ( highlights below ) . restaurant week menu is N less than the usual , so go now to save those precious dimes . superb atmosphere ( suuuper swank ) and rare dishes . they clear your plates faster than you can say " where did my plate go " and clean off your table like you are royalty . the only bad part they are heavy handed on the salt . which i think robbed some dishes of achieving their highest potential . thank goodness they always keep your water glass full . first course ( shared by entire table ) was creamy hummus , salty cumin-y laffa , and salatim - an assortment of salads . the best were eggplant , fennel , pickled veggies , spicy cucumber something , something like tabouli , spicy green beans , and mushy red pepper awesomeness . ( as you can tell , i ' m an expert on lebanese cuisine ) second course , we each got to pick N small plates , which was fantastic . the best was the duck hearts ( omg i ate a duck heart guysssss ) , then the raw lamb ( i didn ' t even think i would like that ) then the house smoked sable ( buttery challah toast , gooey egg , and ballin ' fish ) . i am also excited to say i have eaten thymus , the sweetbread . everything else was crazy salty cauliflower , artichoke , haloumi ( fried cheese ) . main meal - we liked the branzino ( salty ) and the lamb ( salty ) . the duck was good - tasted more like a burger . also salty . dessert - get the tehina cookie ! ! ! it ' s the best . complete with ice cream in between and rich hot chocolate . i didn ' t like my konafi - it ' s like a giant shredded wheat packing cheese and drenched in rosewater simple syrup . not my thing . oh well . the goat cheese froyo on top was good though . the basboosa was alright too . cakey with crumbles . so yea . if you ' ve read up until this point , i ' m impressed . you deserve an award . 
tasty tasty tasty mac and cheese , fried chicken and tater tots a must . smoked brisket was very good . home made ketchup and dill chive dip was a nice addition to the meal . friendly staff
one of the very few reasons i miss new jersey ! you don ' t know italian food until you try this restaurant . the closest delicious italian food i had was when i went to rome a few years ago . i have been to giotto four times . . . and had appetizers , entree and dessert on all those days . i cannot think of any other restaurant where i love everything . . . . they are it ! i hear the two chefs are the owners . . . that explains it . i recommend reservation ( you won ' t get a seat , especially if more than two , without a reservation . . . . the place is packed ) . . . . . they are even busy on mondays when most restaurants in the area are quiet or do not open . and yea , the servers do memorize a lot of stuff , lol . . . and they often have something special . 
this place kind of reminds me of st . louis-style pizza , what with its thinness and rectangular slices , only there are quality ingredients and an impressive crust . speaking of the crust , it ' s bubbly and lightly burnt , which is nice , but on the soft side - i wouldn ' t want to lose the chewy texture entirely , but just a little more crispness would elevate things . red sauce is a weak spot - i ' d prefer something a little more simple that lets the tomato flavor shine . also , a small quibble about the menu ' s listing of " caramelized onions " - the onions here are sauteed , which is quite a different animal than those that are truly caramelized . small shortcomings aside , these pies are thoroughly enjoyable , priced right and deserving of kudos for their use of humanely raised meats . the beer wine list is very respectable , if not mind-blowing . also , the service is friendly , knowledgable and quick . overall , this place is perfect for a low-key dinner any night of the week . 
it is lovely to be able to get a little taste of paris , perfectly executed , in new york city . the macarons at laduree are beyond compare--accept no substitutes . the crisp shell , cakey interior , and smooth filling are incredible combination . i am obsessed with the vanilla , the salted caramel , and the lemon . other flavors , like the chocolate and the raspberry , have not been quite as great for me . while everything about the store , from the very professional staff , to the meticulous decor , to the quality of the product is exactly as you ' d expect in paris , the prices are a bit more expensive . i think i paid N euro for a box of N when i was in paris about N months ago , and it ' s N for the exact same box here . that said , it ' s still lovely and worth the splurge if you like your macarons to be more than just nice to look at . 
the gluten free accomondations are almost as good at max ' s oyster and max ' s fish . the food is normally superb , the service top notch , the managers always check in during dinners and are a pleasure to speak with . i have had salmon which was a tad dry once , but mostly , the food is N stars ridiculously good . unfortunately , max ' s downtown doesn ' t use dee ' s gluten free bread which is amazing ( but other max ' s establishments mostly use dee ' s gf rolls ) and the chef at max ' s downtonw insists on making his own . they are crumbly and dry , made of corn maybe , and not delicious like dee ' s gf free bread rolls . i always look forward to the gf rolls at max ' s restaurants and was a disappointed with the corn dry odd chef ' s gf version of the rolls . can ' t go wrong with the food here - or the atmosphere . fantastic date night spot or special occasion place . always dress up and don ' t forget to valet your lamborghini in front of the restaurant so patrons can take pictures with your car ) . true story 
great local place . i just moved to the area and have been here N or N times already . good bartenders and ownership , great cheap eats and service . 
love this place for the food and the staff . i probably wouldn ' t get the burger again but to be fair wasn ' t bad and it was on special that day--they were probably trying to move it . everything else i ' ve had on my many visits tasted very fresh and was seasoned perfectly . 
just got back from this great place . i went ahead and tried the haggis and tatties , ha ! yum ! total comfort food and it wasn ' t too too heavy . . . well maybe cause the portion size was just right . our waitress kim , was awesome , she made us feel comfortable and welcomed . i thought the owner , who was behind the bar would be more social , but maybe it was an off day . he delivered us our food and didn ' t say a word . didn ' t talk when i was waiting for my b . f . in the restroom either . . . oh well . . . my b . f . ordered the scottish salmon sandwich and it was amazing ! it was smoked salmon people . . . never had that on a sandwich before but trust me , it was divine ! the group of canadian women next to us raved on and on about the house made soups . we will be back next time we are visiting vt . and the prices were good to boot ! 
came back here with my wife and daughter this time , because my wife was craving this type of food . as before ordered the pickled plate for which i would give N stars . i had the lamb sandwich and my wife and daughter had the adana kebab plates . as mentioned before the rice was good but a bit under seasoned . the meat itself was very good and not over cooked . this time i asked for a hot and white sauce . unfortunately both sauces were very under flavored . the white or yogurt sauce seemed almost watered down . . and the red sauce had no spice to it . another miner thing and this has nothing to do with the food . we went there on a very cold day on a saturday afternoon . as much as i like the place . . they had no heat inside which made it a bit uncomfortable to enjoy the food when you are shivering . on the positive note they did offer complimentary tea which was great . . but in the long run . . i would prefer a heater since i don ' t want to wear my jacket while eating inside a restaurant . overall i would love to give this place an extra star . . . and as i said before certain dishes really stand out . the fresh bread , the pickled plate and the meat . i can only comment on what i had and that case the combination of everything i will have to stick to my original N starts . . i would bump it up to N . N if possible . overall a very nice place with good food . . but don ' t think i will be visiting anytime soon as long as there is no heat inside and the temperature stays at record lows . 
this place is amazing . the juicy pork buns are incredible . all the food is fresh and just delicious . the chow mien has all freshly prepared veggies in it . the general tso chicken are chunks of chicken . the house special fried rice is loaded with shrimp , pork and chicken . i truly cannot say enough about this restaurant . 
amazing . the pizza is wonderful , the salads are great , the sandwiches are delicious . the decor is lovely too . the only downside is that it ' s so crowded ( and doesn ' t take reservations ) but that ' s only because everyone else knows how great it is , too . our favorites are the margarita pizza and the campania salad , although everything we ' ve tried has been wonderful . can ' t wait to go back ! 
best pizza in town hands dowwn ! 
small place but flavor-full food , highly recommend the pollo guisado con maduros , which is stewed chicken with sweet plantains , great portions with the prefect sizzle on the chicken glaze . i would recommend this place time and time again , great meals great service and great atmosphere . 
there isn ' t nothing i like more than getting delicious food at a great price in a fun atmosphere ! every time i go i get great service . the guacamole is in my dreams regularly . the restaurant is designed with one long bench seat along a wall with small tables and chairs on the opposite side . so you are always sitting close to your neighbors . this is actually a great thing b c on more than one occasion i have split a pitcher of sangria with my new friends . 
fried strawberries served w yogurt and vinaigrette . . . . ' nuff said
great food , great service . went with the wife and kids . i got the scallop ravioli , my wife got the linguini with clam sauce , son got veil parm , daughter got chicken alfredo . all of these dishes were great . very generous portions . we brought a lot home . 
when i walked in , N waitresses were hissing about the " stupid yuppies " - nice . our waitress , brittany , was so god awful rude . my girlfriend was so upset . we ordered some scallops , the cost was N . . . two regular sized scallops came out on this big plate . we both laughed and sent them back . brittany came flying out with arms up - pissed . we said for N , two scallops is a joke . she lectured us about the " better " restaurants she worked in where for N three scallops was standard . - this waitress was nasty . the restaurant had her working in the puppy pen , where we were sitting . i ' m sure this waitress used to do big things- but now she ' s right were she belongs . . . . and working for free , because after how upset she made my friend , i almost felt like she should have paid us for taking her lip . oh , and good luck reading the menu . unless you speak italian ( which i do and still had difficulties ) . . . this will be irritating . they ' ve tried to make everything seem " high end " . . . but it ' s just annoying . their food is cheap and skimpy and the service just ruined the experience . 
brunch is a must do ! 
pizza is my favorite in new haven . i like the " restaurant atmosphere " but probably wouldn ' t want to be here when it turns in to a " club " late night . 
i love it , i love it , i love it i love it ! i never eat pork because i am very fussy with the amount of fat in pork dishes . but when i go to ippudo , i basically live in pork . pork buns , pork broth , the extra pork that comes with the ramen . i think the only vegetables i ' ve had there are the shishito peppers . for dessert you must try the mascarpone cheese and ice cream . it goes so well with the complimentary green tea . i also like this place because the servers announce you when you walk inside the dining area . it makes me feel like beyonce . 
a wonderful experience all around ! the restaurant has an amazing atmosphere and the food is beyond delicious . i especially recommend the oysters ! loved going for drinks after dinner in the neighborhood but could have stayed at county all night . it is the kind of place where you want to spend your entire evening , taking your time enjoying each dish and the company of the ones you are with . 
came here for brunch one sunday . called ahead to get my name on the list and when i showed up , i was seated almost immediately . get the screwdriver . it ' s yummy ! the bloody mary is just okay . i got a benedict dish that was good , but not the best i ' ve had . loved the atmosphere and the location . 
small and cozy . this place ha great traditional food . ill certainly be returning next time i ' m in the city ! 
this place was delicious . we had a seafood platter appetizer , very fresh and tasty . large scallops that were cooked perfectly . three of us had the surf and turf- steak and lobster tail . the lobster tail was just slightly over cooked but really still good , the steak was delicious as well as the sides . had to take food home . three people ordered desserts , and they enjoyed them all . i had turkish coffee , very good . we were there for over N hours enjoying everything . we were not rushed , the service was great and well timed , and the high booth backs really did offer privacy . 
i ' ve been going hre for N years and it still tastes the same . N stars just for that . hard to beat . 
i tried to go in but their was an hour wait . i went back another day . this time the pouring rain helped me . there was just a short line . i got one of each flavored macaroon . we all thought they were delicious . moist and flavorful . the caramel is my favorite . 
dear levee , it isn ' t often that i say this , but i love you . i can always count on you after a bad day ( or a good one , for that matter ) . whether you ' re offering up dreamsicles ( also known as heaven in a glass ) or a shot of tequila and a lone star ( for only N ! ! ) , i know you ' ll be there for me . i may avoid you on the weekends , but please don ' t take it personal . i ' ll be back next week to play scrabble , hunt deer , and eat cheese puffs . i promise . you are the only one for me . love , sarah
improved all around . the en su punto is one of my favorite cocktails ever . everything was delicious down to some of the best cafe con leche and ultra-creamy flan for dessert . 
the food and service was excellent . the amount of food for the price we paid was amazing . we enjoyed the taverna chips for appetizer which are the deep fried zucchini and eggplant chips , yum ! also has the fried calamari , just as delicious . for the main course we enjoyed the atlantic salmon and the gyro plater , again the quantity and quality were excellent . thanks for a wonderful experience . 
tried this place for the first time last night . i gotta say , it was impressive . we got there early , and it was empty at about N N . by the time we left an hour or so later , the place was mostly full . you can see what they ' re reaching for here with the eleven madison park and el bulli cookbooks on display . and for the price , location and casual nature of the place , they are achieving a lot . what we ate blt buns , korean bbq wraps , scallops and fried chicken . it was just enough food for two people to try a bunch of different flavors and techniques . everything was screaming for siracha though . order of deliciousness for me scallops , blt , fried chicken and the bbq wraps . you can get better bbq wraps at much divier places . this is supposed to be elevated ? all in all , with a N bottle of totally drinkable wine , and it was a nice dinner for two on a random thursday night . i will definitely go back if when i ' m in the area . 
fantastic concept ! delicious food the best cappuccino in the city . the downside is the crowd of tourists that always flock to the place , best to go during off hours , lunchtime is overpacked . 
amazing , i always heard of this place from my friends . it is a definitely a must-try place in new york . definitely spicy but really good . the prices are high considering there is not nice decor in the area
the unit price per dumpling here is very low , so you can get a lot of food cheaply . but , this place is a dump , the staff was sick and or hacking lugies into the trash can next to the fryer . although i know chinese food is usually not made in the most sanitary environments it was a little too much for me . i will not be going back , unless i only have N bucks and really really want dumplings . 
the food is great . i " ve been coming to the risotto house since it opened . my favorite lamb shank with mushroom risotto . yum ! fettuccini fumo is awesome . salads are delish . however , since rolando ( the main server ) left , service had declined a bit . but food is always consistent and fair . byob . 
love this place . they recently expanded and it looks great . spice grill is an extremely moderately priced , very casual , and yet delicious restaurant . we have been to this one and the east hanover location a few times and the food is always delicious . this past time we got extremely tender tandoori chicken--it was perfect . samosa chat , also flavorful and well balanced , and the paneer makhani with prawns as well . the prawns were slightly overcooked , but the dish was terrific . flavors that dance across all of the different tastebuds . even the next day it was delicious ! ! ! hmm , and i always forget the name of this dessert . . . but it was made with mango and cardamom and a custard ice cream texture . i will be back again and again ! 
oh my , what a lovely selection of pomme frites dips you have ! ? ! ? i ordered the sweet chili , " mexican " ketchup , and cheddar with my large fries . . . i was sharing with friends . . . i swear ! the sweet chili may have been my favorite - just as the name suggests - it was sweet and spicy ( oh baby ! ) . the " mexican " ketchup in no way resembles " american " ketchup . it was a freshly blended mix of jalape o and cilantro - yum ! with all that spicy-goodness , i thought i would get something completely different , hence , the cheddar . this did provide our burning tongues with a nice , tasty break . the fries and sauces didn ' t stand a chance - they were wiped out before glee even started . . . that ' s right , i was at a glee premiere party ! 
parking here was pretty difficult . but nonetheless this place was amazingly the food was great . the dessert was amazing , i ' m a mango lover so this place is a plus ! the hot and sour shrimp soup was great ! definitely would recommend going back here . 
this place is simply amazing from the healthy , tasty food to the gracious staff . i love that it ' s byob , too . the background music is off the chain . considering the limited time that it has been opened , i ' ve been there entirely too much . as i ' m typing this review , the craving has started . guess where i ' ll be tonight ? ! 
gem of a place ! big tray of chicken was most amazing- steamed dumplings were above par ! highly recommended to anyone with an appetite for flavorful food a 
i just moved to philadelphia , and my sister and i went out trying to taste some of the more trendy places to eat . we both were very skeptical of eating here , and wondered how good pan-asian food really could be , but decided to suck it up and see what all the fuss was about . . . . we were nothing short of blown away ! here are my notes from the evening N . service our server was very helpful in helping us decide what to order and on warning us how big the portions are . i also loved that the bottle of wine did not sit on the table , which is a pain for the server but he did a very good job . N . food ordered edamame ravioli - my new favorite thing in the world ! a must order . house salad- big enough portion for two , and it was pretty good , i ' m just not a huge salad person . lobster fried rice- i did not like this at all , again portion was big enough for two , but the soy sauce is a little sweet for my liking , so i felt like i ruined it by adding the soy sauce . butter poached lobster- so so good ! again , we shared this because the portions are so big . the sauce it is in was delicious . dessert- chinese donuts , which i did not want to order because i do not like them normally . . . and well , i ate N of these when they came to the table . the cream , chocolate , and what seemed to be a raspberry truffle sauce . . . outstanding . N . atmosphere a little close to the table next to us , but we also showed up late for our reservation , which they were very nice about . the decor is very impressive and very hip . . . it is a place you could take anyone into and they would be impressed by how cool it is and very romantic at the same time . N . price worth every penny ! the portions were so big , with two people the bill was only N . keep in mind the N included a N bottle of wine . so we got wine , salads , appetizer , two entrees , and dessert for that . and walked out stuffed . N . summary go ! and if you don ' t get the edamame ravioli , you will regret it ! i can ' t wait to go back and try more stuff ! ! 
i love their pizza greatly but their customer service and management is greatly lacking . i came to bar with friends after calling the restaurant and being told i " wouldn ' t need a reservation " . when we got there , we were told it was a N minute wait . so we spent some time at the bar and a group of people offered us their table after about N minutes . a waitress informed us we needed to immediately leave the table because it was reserved for a group even though the group was already there and eating ? confusing . i went to the hostess to see how much longer the wait would be and she told us an hour . i tried to explain to her that we had been waiting for almost an hour and she apathetically apologized when i told her because of this experience i wouldn ' t be returning to the restaurant . it ' s too bad because the live music and the pizza is awesome . ( 
i have been there few times , only because it is convenient . after my last experience i will not return . had some drinks and ordered N . N garlic knots . the knots had a hair baked in . . . . they would not replace them or take them off the bill . i contacted them after the fact as well , and got no reply . guess they don ' t mind losing a lot of customers for N . N . unbelievable ! 
i went and had the best chicken parmigiana sandwich ever ! plus i took some of their pasta home and it was outstanding ! ! the owners were friendly and courteous and spent time talking with us about their store and fresh made products . i strongly recommend ! 
good food , good service . there have been times where the service was a little too slow but it has only happened on few occasions . i love the chimichurri skirt steak ! 
this is real pizza made the real slow way . the wait is slow moving , the pizzas are slow moving . but what you sacrifice in time you make up in quality of experience and quality of food . the atmosphere is comfortable , homey , and natural . service is friendly , and attentive . pizzas are absolutely delicious , and they are a much-needed and welcome addition to the neighborhood . i wish the wait was not as long , but that ' s what happens when you have a quality product . 
their cheesesteak was cold , with barely melted cheese and tough meat . i expected much more from them . 
i am currently traveling around north america testing out poutines at every restaurant i can , and when i heard that this restaurant had some great poutine , i had to try . as a poutine enthusiast , i have tried the best of the best , and i will say that although canada does it much better , this place was pretty good . the fries were perfectly crispy and they even used cheese curds ! they could do some work on the gravy , but overall it was a solid poutine . if you ' re not able to get to canada to satisfy your craving for poutine , this is the next best thing . 
first thing that stands out about alice ' s arbor is the service . it ' s been a whole to find a nicer bunch of servers and other staff on one restaurant . the other thing that stands out is how many other things they do well . while this place would be great for a date , you could also take your parents here , or come with a couple of kids , or come just for a happy hour and upscale bar food . everyone can have a good time . the vibe is welcoming and casual but there ' s still that emphasis on quality in service food and drink that shines through . they have an actively rotating craft brew selection from local ny and nyc breweries some of which are very small scale and are doing really adventurous and delicious beers . try anything from silvercut brewery and you ' ll see what i mean . i here they are adding or doubling their tap lines too . great place to wash down some oysters with one or a few local beers . lunch is fantastic and so is dinner . lunch is a lot easier on the wallet . i hope to see the dinner menu become a little more seasonal and light during summer months . some of the dishes are a little on the heavy side in the ny heat . 
d so went to verlaine for the first time , and have to say , it lives up to its reputation . verlaine is a nice place to grab a drink for a first date , after work or for pretty much any other reason . many of the drinks are drinks with an asian twist . i recommend the lychee martini . was there during the happy hour which goes from Npm-Npm . a longer happy hour for a cheaper price than most places in ny so definitely a good deal . around N , the dj came on so it started getting a lot louder and hard to be heard . but nothing worth taking away from the N rating . definitely a good place to pre-game or just to hang out with friends . c came here as my first date with d ! also was my first time at verlaine after yelping for a place with great happy hrs . ordered the yummy lychee martini , delicious and pretty strong ! we came here on a wednesday night . . not too crowded , great place for get together to grab a drink or N . came back a few weeks later with a couple of girlfriends on a monday night , ordered the white sangria from the happy hr special . highly recommended ! i think i downed the whole drink in N mins . my friend ordered the vietnamese bloody mary ( also on the happy hr special ) thinking oo exotic . that was pretty gross unfortunately . nevertheless , def the place for the start of the night or just a mini weeknight get together . 
great italian food and great pizza . anytime my family wants italian , we always go to fortes . i love the pesto and the garlic knobs . 
we went twice in one week . refreshing margaritas - had a delicious cucumber and ginger one , also love the signature one rosalina ( ? ) . the guacamole is a great starter as you peruse the menu , it ' s served with a dish of smoky sauce , chips and warm tortillas . the appetizers and mains are creative , delicious and filling - we loved the enchilada suizas and the chicken norte , and the chile rellenos were smoky and gigantic over a swash of creamy sauce . the staff fussed over us in the nicest way ( weeknight dining pays off ) . the bar is very busy , having happy hr food drink specials that could constitute dinner . and in the rosy red back room there are big tables that make you hope you remember fonda for the next birthday party . a candle in the excellent tres leche cake . 
i like the one on the blvd better . the south philly one is always full of drink a-holes . crab fries are out of this world good . and the beer keg thing , unbelievable . lol . sandwiches are above average . this place is a great place to hang out , watch the game , eat and drink . can ' t ask for more ? 
having a breakfast scramble is the perfect way to start your day ! ! the sausage and hot sauce in this is great and packs plenty of flavour ! ! its not too spicy and doesn ' t turn the wrap into a soggy pile of mush . fresh ingredients and a great choice of fresh organic juices . service was friendly and fast . thanks ) 
i am basing this review on their tomato pie . fairly new place and i agree with johns review . this is probably the most underrated pizza place in the area . around the same quality as delorenzos and itsnuts but with the credit cards and delivery . my new " go to " pizza place . 
i had the roasted duck noodles here , and they were surprisingly good . the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the broth matched very well . nobody could say much for the environment , which is not particularly pleasant , but for such a low price the quality is certainly where it should be , in the food . 
wonderful gem of a restaurant - contemporary casual seating facing the east river , friendly staff . the dining area is not that large but the place is very comfortable . there is parking downstairs . there was confusion in the order , i had my appetizer duplicated and the entree forgotten but the server was very friendly and my entree was the lamb salad . there were many many choices for restaurant week . colecchio ' s staff has prepared an excellent creative menu for restaurant week . the beer choices are many . thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the variety of breads and menu choices . the seating is comfortable - not on top of each other but not as spacious as places in hotels . i enjoy the variety and creativity of collechio ' s casual riverpark and tap room restaurants much better than keller ' s casual bouchon and ad hoc restaurants . no one rushed us out but we had an odd experience of someone following us to the restroom when we exited and complaining to us when we departed that they didn ' t mean to be rude but were waiting for our table for ten minutes . . we had better manners than to respond . . no one at the restaurant pushed us to leave or even suggested that there was any rush - they were asking us if we wanted more coffee and our order was only slightly delayed because of the forgotten salad entree . now i don ' t know how or why this new yorker was targeting our table for themselves and we were only dining there for N . N hours and i believe that all upscale restaurants space bookings N . N-N hours apart . but i will leave this to frentic hyperactive rat race life of new york city vs . california . it didn ' t make sense as in a public environment next to the hospital who knows who you are speaking to ? we still thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would return again as the menu is extensive . 
in terms of restaurant pizza , it is quite appetizing , but as a ny style pizza , it just didn ' t have that particular ny slice that i have come to love and crave . as my wife put it , it is more like a regular thin crust brick oven pizza that you could get anywhere . 
went here for brunch today for the first time . everyone enjoyed their food and there was a good variety of standard brunch choices . i got the sausage biscuits and gravy which i heartily recommend . my brother ' s gf got the bagel with lox and it looked great and was a very generous portion . their home fries are the best i ' ve experienced anywhere on the philly brunch circuit . they also have a lunch menu which looked solid with a variety of sandwiches , though i ' ve yet to try one . the back of the restaurant has about N fridges stocked with over N craft beers , and they also have growlers available . a solid first experience at hawthornes , i ' ll definitely return for more food or beer in the future . 
mark ' s slider is second to minetta tavern ' s black label burger because i broke a N year bet on this burger . i lasted seven months without meat burgers and broke my fast on this baby . i ' m not quite sure if that should be sadness or happiness but i ' ll sway to the latter . big thanks to philip n for screening and approving all of my st . mark ' s bites this evening . he really knows his food and will not disappoint you . i am happy to have such great friends irl and it ' s nice when they cross over into yelp . the shakes at mark sound good . salted caramel or strawberry your thing ? yes , mine too . then again , i rarely decline a shake . cheap but really decent beer is on the menu . it ' s st . mark ' s ! this street will not rip you off ! all orders should also include fries . they are perfectly crispy without going hollow in the middle . best part of mark other than the sliders ? spicy dipping sauces ! ! hello ! 
best ice cubes i ' ve ever seen . yes , it ' s tight , but it ' s not a dealbreaker . the amount of effort put into each drink is equivalent to a mixology talent show . and they usually make for a nice beverage , to boot . burger delicious . that ' s all i got . 
open late , great mushroom and cheese dogs . N in jersey
top notch service amazing food great location and ambiance . really want more could you want ? went here for my birthday with my husband and in laws . seriously good stuff . definitely get the polenta . i dream about it . also , make reservations . i will be going back . its definitely reasonable for the entire experience
this review is for the beer garden . . . i ' ve actually never stepped foot inside . that said , on a nice day . . . why would you ? the semi-permanent food truck in the garden has the best beer that you will ever drink from a can but the bell ringer for me was the hot dog . you are probably going wtf . . . a hot dog ? ! ? not your ordinary dog . . . mine was perfect . . . the casing had the perfect snap and taste and it came with the best assortment of toppings i can imagine . sauerkraut , chili , onions , mustard , and macaroni salad . . . . i don ' t know why it works . . . . it just does . 
so good . get there earlier or phone ahead , because people line up for this guy . i don ' t know what to recommend , because everything is worth trying at least once . i ' ve been to india , but i never saw anybody put fresh , green lettuce in a dosa before . in fact , the options all look pretty unique to me , and you have lovely washington square park right there to eat them in . yummy samosas and chutneys to dip ' em in on the side . five stars for a food cart . great value , and one of those things that makes people erroneously but affectionately coo " only in new york . " 
try the N burger and billy burger - best in the world - no joke . also my wife had the turkey burger - she swears its the best she ' s had . nice back yard area for the nice days too ! food is great . great mojitos and beer selection . friendly wait staff . my favorite place in brooklyn to date . 
i don ' t know what all the hype is about . . . the food is ok , but it ' s too crowded i had to wait for long to get my food . i will give them another try next time , but if the line is too long , will have to pass . 
not a bad choice for lunch , especially since they have a few tables . pretty decent kati rolls . reasonably authentic flavors , and in a sign of confidence , lots of desis eating here . the paratha which forms the wrap is not greasy . however , only a few things on the menu appeal to me , although it seems quite long , unlike at briyani cart . 
i loved the thousand layer bread , crispy taro root , asian tea leaf salad and chicken w pickled cabbage . the rangoon house salad was fresh , but the dressing didn ' t seem to fit . the tofu green curry and sauteed fresh mushrooms were well cooked , but otherwise unremarkable . i don ' t know exactly what distinguishes burmese cuisine from its other southeast asian counterparts , but the menu carried alot of dishes popular at thai restaurants . based on what my party ordered , i would recommend going to a thai place for a thai dish . the service at the restaurant was prompt and friendly . some people may find it tacky , but i really appreciate that they left us a pitcher of water . 
friendly staff . . . excellent food , fairly priced . perfect for take out too ! 
in my opinion , this restaurant is one of the best in new york . the food is incredible , the service is great and the ambiance is rustic , romantic and charming . the menu is seasonal , which makes each experience new and exciting . the only issue i have with this restaurant is the food portion sizes . some menu items are a tad bit small for the price although this is not the case for all items . however , it doesn ' t deter me from going back to eat there again and again . absolutely superb . 
things that are terrible getting your car towed for no good reason . things that make it just a bit better brunch at catahoula . i ' m already an avid fan of dinner here , but breakfast was beyond delicious . the buttermilk cornmeal flapjacks are unlike any other pancakes i ' ve had before super thick , slightly crunchy , both sweet and savory in the same bite . no syrup needed , though the bit of fresh fruit on top is nice . for N you can also get a crazy good deal on brunch specials choice of an entree and side , plus a select draft beer . 
pooooor service . everytime i call they are out of pizza or they are not delivering . the pizza is ok not great and the hotdogs are whatever if you like that but seriously N times i have called and no service . i hope that those hot dogs can keep them in business as for me that is the last time i call . rude too . 
love ! love ! love ! if you like to eat , this is the spot . love going here for spices . there is so much to eat that ' s it ' s good to go with some friends . buy things . share them . this way , you can try more food . 
had a great dinner experience here with friends - we were celebrating a Nst birthday , and our server was very friendly and attentive . sit outdoors if you get the chance ! the food is delicious - we ordered mostly " small " plates , except for two friends who shared a burger , and the " small " plates are definitely not small . the burrata crostini is absolutely delicious . we also had a few beers and the really excellent pear cider . the atmosphere is very relaxed and overall it ' s an amazing establishment in the heart of princeton . 
one of my friends took me here over the weekend . . . i was apprehensive at first but after walking in , i knew i ' d love it ! there is a great vibe atmosphere with the crowd of people there on a saturday night , and the owners were there walking around and talking to all the patrons . the meatballs were delicious - i ' d recommend them " naked " or as sliders with the classic tomato or spicy meat sauce . i didn ' t even make it to the sides but i ' ll definitely go back to try again . 
salted caramel budino makes top five things i ' ve ever eaten , ever . pastas are light and delicious , pizzas are a little greasy but so nice all the same . cured meat board yes , please . service was efficient and pleasant , despite the fact that the place was totally mobbed . and it was tuesday . you should probably go there . 
the best service i have received in a restaurant in a very long time . the staff was prompt and courteous from the moment we walked in . our water glasses were continually filled , our wine glasses were never left empty and the food was delivered quickly . the tapas were amazing and we enjoyed being able to try multiple menu items . our primary water was knowledgeable about the food and the vast wine selection . we left very impressed and hope to return soon ! 
up a flight of stairs and off to the left , hourglass-a . k . a . bettibar- has an " in the know " sort of feel to it . once perched on our bar stools--there are only a few tables on the floor--we were quickly entertained by the bar man on staff . he was affable , friendly , but just a bit too loud and keen on having a monologue rather than a dialogue-again , he was entertaining , so this is not a huge complaint , but rather something to mention-he got us what we wanted without a hitch . for those who wish to nosh , there ' s also a fairly solid bar menu . fun bit affixed to the walls are a couple of vintage-looking hourglasses that patrons may tip to their delight as the sand runs out . also , there ' s a gorgeous chandelier that hangs just toward the far end of the room by the windows that overlook Nth st . note no soda gun on hand , so tonic , coke , soda and the like are dispensed from cans . 
the best meal i ' ve had in recent memory . michael white is the pasta king . go . just go . 
delicious ! my husband does not eat meat , however , he loves what we ' d call the salad bar , and frankly so do i . very high quality cheeses , meats , vegetables , salads and pastas . onto the meats provided by the gauchos . . . ordinarily i ' m a filet mignon gal , but here my favorite is the sirloin . the sides they serve at the table are nothing to write home about , to be honest . i have my doubts if the potatoes are real potatoes , to be honest . the rolls , however , are very unique and delicious . they remind me of an egg pastry or a puff pastry or what my mom would call yorkshire pudding . i could eat plates of them . the desserts are slightly above average , nothing super creative . . mostly your classic steakhouse desserts . i would highly recommend this place for a special occasion dinner . enjoy ! 
i ' ve been here a few times and have always loved it . our most recent visit wasn ' t the traif i remember . writing reviews is all about visiting a place a few times and hoping the magic is still there and being thankful when it still is . all the dishes i ' ve loved were missing something my last visit . i still want to give it another try before making a final decision , but this place still has a piece of my heart . 
i had their coconut bubble tea , it was horrible . but boba was hard as if it had been out for days , and the tea it self tasted burnt and it was barley sweetened . i was disappointed to know that they did not serve warm bubble tea , since it is cold outside . many other bubble tea places that i have tried have been much better , for a better price , and have had both hot and cold bubble tea options . i did not try anything else in the restaurant but the place did smell nice and was very nicely decorated . 
this place sucks ! ! ! menus is extremely limited , service sucks and food is over priced and tastes like nothing . to make matters worse once we told waitress how bad it was N min after food came out since that was the only time she came over she said well the next time the manager said if you tell us right away we will make you something different . too bad the waitress never came out and all staff ignored us . there will never be a next time . save your time and money never come here it is not the merchant house . 
an oldie but goodie . reliable brunch fare , generous portions , and fast service . the only reason it gets N stars versus N stars which is what it deserves is that the fries were over cooked , too much butter used for its omelette dishes , and finally the manager man who works there with a suit and horned rimmed glasses came out of the bathroom and wiped his hands on a pile of clean linens that customers would ultimately be wiping their mouths with while dining . 
as an english person , visiting our son , daughter in law and grandchildren was taken to his restuarant for my Nth birthday . the staff were fantastic , the chef came to see us personally , with new dishes he was creating , i felt spoilt , loved the atmosphere and the food was amazing , from the popcorn onwards . a wee bit noisy as the evening went on , but i think that is an age thing on my part . will definately visit next time we are in new york . thankyou
was up in brooklyn visiting friends and was taken to this place by a fellow foodie whose taste i trust . what an awesome place . no joke , maybe the best burger i ' ve ever had . anywhere . and for the price it is certainly the best " value " burger i ' ve ever had . and the sides and soups are great too . try the mac and cheese . you won ' t be sorry . my only regret was that i couldn ' t go back again during my stay to try more of the menu . will definitely go again when i am in brooklyn again . also , the place as a mellow , casual , inviting vibe with very friendly helpful bartenders and waitstaff . can ' t think of a better place to have a casual bite and drink with friends or a date in the nyc area . seriously , go to this place . 
one of our favorite italian restaurants in nyc ! 
definitely my favorite place in the neighborhood . to bad it is always packed . i would go there more often . my thing is to try brunch but when i see amount of people waiting . . . our favorite dishes on the menu are the house made ricotta - always so good - and the seared scallops . drinks are little expensive , but still this place is the best in the neighborhood . 
firebird is a great little place to stop in for breakfast or lunch ! i absolutely love that they serve breakfast all day . i just wish they were open until N N instead of N N ! whenever i ' m in essex around lunchtime , this is the place i look forward to going ! the space is fairly small , but there is seating . i usually get take-out , which is always pretty quick . every time i visit , i am happy with what i order . the huevos rancheros are by far my favorite , but i just recently ventured into the turkey reuben territory . let me tell you , those huevos have some competition ! i think the portion sizes are fair for the prices , which are comparable to other restaurants in the area . they also have great coffee and espresso drinks . i highly recommend giving this place a try ! 
unlimited sangria bar ? ! umm . . that ' s an automatic N stars in my book . i loved my experience here , even tho we got here when the kitchen was about to be closed and we were only able to get N sangrias in . their brunch is decent and with the unlimited sangria it was perfect . did i mention there ' s unlimited sangria with every meal ? they don ' t take reservations so get here early ! then you can get back in line as many times as you want to try each and every one of their N-N flavors of sangria ( i kept losing count of how many flavors there were with every giggle causing sip i had of the yummy liquid stuff ) . granted only two of the sangrias were legitimately flavored and the rest were fruity juices , regardless they were all delicious
the atmosphere is so-so , the grumpy manager is not making the scene any better . i think this place is overrated . pizza is delicious though . long queues in front is a bonus . 
great , authentic italian food a . please note restaurant is cash only , but it ' s worth the inconvenience . i grew up in rome the food tasted like home . all the waiters staff were real italians were a pleasure . i enjoyed everything especially the artichoke salad . also very fair prices , even for the wine list . would recommend to anyone who wants real italian food this cuisine is very different from " italian american " . 
small place . there is seating , but there ' s no atmosphere . great for take-out sandwiches . 
love the chill vibe of habana , and the awesome corn oh so good , the frozen margaritas hit the spot ! 
fun fact about their soup dumplings most places use a piece of wax paper on the bottom of the steamer , you know , like normal dim sum dishes . but the thing is , these dumplings are so delicate that when you pick one up , the bottom of the dumpling usually sticks to the paper , and the force of the lifting tears the skin which causes the soup to leak out . you ' re then left confused and distort , heart broken over the puddle of dumpling essence that was so helplessly wasted . i like this place because not only are their soup dumplings ( and all other dishes ) so stupidly delicious , but also because they were smart enough to use lettuce leaves to line the bottom so that the dumplings sit on a slick surface . you can thus successfully pick up your dumpling in confidence , without the worry of potential heartache , and transport them onto your plate with your little pouch of liquid happiness in tact . yay happy endings
old style italian restaurant . great service and great food . good place to take the parents . 
again another burger stop that is a must ! now i ' m from the west coast and was in chicago just a while ago . i ate at kumas , and now this place . . . . i swear i am going to get fat and love every minute of it ! i am in love ! when it comes to good food . . . price is no option . l . robbins
great neighborhood restaurant . i took a client out here for lunch , a great spot to go over business . the restaurant was lively but not loud and the waitress seem busy enough that the service wasn ' t overbearing . i started at the bar and had a glass a wine , the bartender was very helpful in deciding which wine would suit me best . he pour a few samplers before i decided to go with the pecorino " fenesia . " 
i ' ll get the good part out of the way the chicken cheese steak is incredible . as a long-time vegetarian who has frequent cravings for hot greasy food , this place is a god-send . the bad news is that i have only successfully walked in and walked out satisfied maybe N out of N or N trips . i hate to say it , but the service is totally hit or miss . some days it ' s awesome with extremely friendly people there who are a delight to deal with . other days it ' s just plain awful . last night finally put me over the edge and forced me to write this review . i walk in and request a half a chicken cheese steak and fries , a great combo for N . N and one i ' ve had for dinner a few times after getting home late . there was a new guy at the register who didn ' t know how to ring up the order . he asked the cook who responded , " we don ' t do the half a chicken cheese steak and fries after N N . " i don ' t argue . " i ' ll just get a whole chicken cheese steak and fries then . " a reasonable request . he informs me they are out of bread ( really ? ! ) and i can have a spinach or wheat wrap . i go for wheat . and no vegan mayo ( because hey , it ' s kind of gross ) . let me also take a minute to note that the guy taking my order was super nice . the cook not so much . N minutes later and i get my order - a pepper steak on a spinach wrap with the mayo and no fries . now , either they didn ' t care , are completely incompetent , or hate me . so it was an epic fail of a trip . i have definitely given up on them for the time being . the sad part is that this was my first trip back since my last temporary boycott of govinda ' s . the last time i went i asked the guy what their veggie protein was and where they got it . he responded , " it ' s from a place in brooklyn that only sells to restaurants like us . you can ' t buy it anywhere else . " the thing govinda ' s has going for it is that the food is great - but when you can ' t even get the food you order and the staff is openly snide , it definitely causes it to lose some appeal . 
this place is so heart warming . the atmosphere is rustic and homey . loved the bangers and mash . the
i started to write N different reviews about purbird but didn ' t feel like anything i started with could do this place justice . so this is what you get . i ' m going to break my review down in parts below based on all of the ways i ' ve experienced purbird . food above all , i have never had chicken like they have here . which , i guess is a good thing because they sell , well , chicken . only chicken . the only way i can describe it is fresh and really tasteful . i ' ve ordered most things on the menu ( though i now have my go-to ) but have yet to be completely disappointed . there are things i would tweak but i wouldn ' t dare make suggestions as i think the chef or owner ( whoever runs the place ) really took care in creating the dishes , so i think it ' s just my little personal quirks or preferences that set my ideas apart , so i ' ll just tweak my order on a few things . if you ' re sick , f ' ing order the chicken soup . i actually contemplated docking my rating a star because they don ' t sell the soup in bulk . . . hey when i ' m sick i want this soup for every meal , not just one . i can ' t be bothered with ordering every time i want to eat . please consider offering larger quantities of this . dine in great atmosphere . warm . i alos love when the weather is nice . you can sit outside in a clean area and enjoy your food and great people watching . the big table on the left in the back is a bit wobbly , watch your drinks , but that can be fixed . delivery i don ' t get delivery often because i only love N blocks away . if you ' re looking for a complaint , i would say bigger soup options . i truly hope this place succeeds , which i think it is . i can only imagine what would happen if they also opened a purcow . . . 
delicious food ! among the best i ' ve had in brooklyn . i ' m not a fan of dining in because the place is a bit small , but the food is delish ! pity they don ' t deliver to where i live ) onion fritters were good , garlic naan was soft and fluffy ) 
went for restaurant week last weekend with several friends . appetizers - phillycheesesteak eggrols udon thai chicken wraps pita and hummus main course - steak salmon crab cakes sides - mash potatoes dessert - tangerine sorbet food N N - everything here you have probably experienced before . there is nothing fancy or new here . salmon was extremely bland and lacking in flavor . crab cakes were salty , etc . everything tasted like it was store bought . don ' t expect much of the steak either . it ' s tiny and tastes like korean bbq ( which i eat a lot so i was dissapointed ) atmosphere N N - if it wasn ' t so loud and full of drunk young people it ' ll be pretty nice but i didn ' t have that luxury service N N - extremely poor service . waitress seemed tired and saw her maybe N times in the three hours we were there . i ' ve been a server before and always give servers the benefit of the doubt but i ' m pretty sure the kitchen wasn ' t that backed up that day she just entered our next course N min after we finished our previous course . conclusion - if you ' re there for food look somewhere else . if you ' re there for drinks don ' t come here either . . . go to a real bar . the food tastes like store bought and service is horrendous . if you do want to give this place a shot be prepared to wait for a while for your food and poor service . 
came here friday and sunday . think i found another good authentic vietnamese restaurant . still have to go back to try different dishes . service is also good and fast . 
really cozy and fun atmosphere with a friendly stuff and the drunken noodles were amazing . can ' t wait to come back ! 
i just took my parents to this restaurant for my mother ' s birthday . this is where she wanted to go since it is close to home . the minute i walked into the restaurant something seemed off . first problem-- i felt rushed and we were the only people there . i said out loud that i wasn ' t going to be rushed--loud enough to be heard . second problem--the table was way too small for N people--it was more like for N people . third problem--due to the lack of space on the table , my dad ended up with a drink spilled on him . the staff did help clean this up . forth problem--the salad dressings seemed to be out of a marie ' s jar . fifth problem--when the food came out there was no place to put the food . my mother sat between N sizzling paella pans with less than an inch on each side . i got so mad that i stood up and moved my sizzling paella pan to another table--of course mom was saying its ok , i have plenty of room . when the waiter came over to ask if everything was ok i said no . there isn ' t enough room to eat . the waiter did not offer to move some of the pots to another table . there were about N other tables available some large enough for N people . sixth problem--the waiter started vacuuming while we were eating--again i said in a loud voice--every minute he spends vacuuming while we are trying to eat the tip is going down . the food was good , but the aggravation made the meal very unpleasant . would i go back there--absolutely not . i would recommend don pepe ' s across route N . 
went here for the first time last week . cozy and romantic little spot with a great menu and the best guac i have ever tasted ! ! ! seriously , go and you ' ll thank me ! 
great food . escargot is the must ! ! ! i really liked seared pork tenderloin . very very delicious . i went there N times . both were good service and good food . recommend to everybody who ' s looking for good french restaurant ) ) 
awesome addition to the neighborhood . if you haven ' t had the kimchi taco truck yet , go chase it down now or , well , just come to kimchi grill . the small menu has essentially N dishes with N proteins , but don ' t be fooled into thinking they ' ll be the same dish . the tacos especially are completely different depending on what the main protein is . the chicken is also prepared differently in the tacos the other stuff . so far , my hands down favorite is the short rib bowl with fried rice - although i ' d probably order highly recommend the multi-grain brown rice . the tacos are great , and really loaded up , but go ahead over-order . all the sauces and veggies are really tasty , you pretty much can ' t go wrong . i do sort of wish that their fried rice was the same as the truck rice , but hey . . . that still gives me an excuse to gorge on street corners from time to time . cash only , closed mondays ! 
it ' s roberta ' s . what the hell were you expecting ? go here with visiting family you ' re trying to impress . 
wavering around N . N for me . the location may be a little hard to find but the restaurant atmosphere itself is very clean and quaint . however , i won ' t lie - the " c " health rating in the window was a little off-putting . the back of the restaurant was drafty - kept my jacket on the whole time while eating . nonetheless , i enjoyed the table set up inside . the waitresses we had were a little scatterbrained and awkward . . sort of mulled around while we were eating , but never asked how we were doing . . . there are a ton of choices - from different styles of katsu to an endless list of appetizers . we opted for the ginger eggplant , tuna poki salad , a spicy cod roe rice ball , pork katsu curry , and pork katsu donburi ( mixed with egg and served over rice ) . the beer is pretty cheap here - N for N oz pitcher or N for N oz . food came out pretty quickly . i loved the poki and rice ball . eggplant was a little overpriced but flavorful and cooked to the perfect texture . katsu curry was delicious , but not mindblowing . donburi was just okay , i loved the katsu itself but my egg white was still slightly raw coming out and there was a little too much rice . what impressed me most about this place is the amount of japanese i heard while i was here - definitely speaks to the authenticity of the cuisine . wouldn ' t go out of my way to come back here , but still glad that i was able to try it out ) 
if cheap is all you care about , then you should go here . if you want consistent quality and good service from an owner who cares--absolutely do not go here . there should be an option for zero stars . my family and i have been coming to gina ' s for a long time , but tonight was the last time i will ever come back . we always come for the two slice special . why ? partly ( very partly ) because of the price , but mainly for the quality and experience . the last several times we ' ve come , we ' ve noticed the pizza is vastly different every time . sometimes big , sometimes half as big , sometimes right amount of cheese , a lot of times hardly any cheese . in the same sitting with four people , you ' ll find the slice size and quality is all over the place--literally some slices half as big as the others , with half as much cheese . tonight , i decided to bring it up to the owner . when you buy a product , it ' s good to know you ' re going to get the same thing every time . especially when they continue to charge you the same price every time . when i suggested they work on their consistency , the owner was incredibly rude and said if you don ' t like what i have to serve , " get out ! " " where else can you find a cheaper pizza . " mr . owner , that ' s not my point . i don ' t really care if you have the cheapest pizza in town . i ' m asking that you be consistent with your product , quality and experience--especially since you charge me the same price every time . if you ' re going to give me a . N experience , at least tell me you ' re giving me that and don ' t charge me more than . N . this isn ' t about affordability--it ' s about consistency . next time i want a . N experience , believe me , i ' ll go to the . N store . if you don ' t care about consistent quality and just want some good , big , cheap pizza , that probably won ' t be the same way when you go back the second , third or fourth time , even though you ' ll still be charged the same price--then go for it . if you want to patronize an owner that is cocky and rude to his customers and doesn ' t care what his customers think because he ' s so hung up on the fact that he serves " the cheapest pizza in town " and has no idea what consistent quality and service mean--then , go for it ! zero stars . 
nice place with a nice staff . portions are pretty big here , even the small sized dishes , so they usually last me two meals . i usually come here to pick up one of their flavorful protein muffins for breakfast , and i ' m dying to try out their " very special carrot cake " 
went to this place on a monday night with a good friend for the chance to eat dishes created by an iron chef . and we were completely amazed by what we ate ! ! ! we got the tasting menu ( that included the highly recommended chili lobster ) . and course after course was delicious ! the first course was the kampachi tartare that was divine . it was served with this citrus sauce that i was eating with a spoon it was so good . my other extreme favorite was the lamb dish . it was lamb loin cooked in pastrami spices served with a slaw , stone ground mustard and rye gnocchi . the chef ' s version of a ruben . to die for ! ! ! and the cheesecake sitting in a pool of delicious rhubarb sauce . . . my oh my . this is for sure my new favorite place ! ! ! ! 
the dumpling soondubu was amazzzinnggg . one of the best tofu stews that i ' ve ever had . i wish i lived closer to this place ! ! i ' m getting hungry just thinking about it . . . i would probably try another soondubu next time , because although the dumpling one was good , it was more because i like dumplings , and not because it added a lot to the stew . everyone gets a fried whole fish to themselves . . . a little on the saltier side . there was also egg fried zucchini , but they only gave us N slices for a table of N . ( everyone who ordered soondubu got this dish of burnt rice soaked in hot water ( or maybe it was hot tea ) . tastes like shower water . i would probably give this place N stars but the waitress was annoying the hell out of me . we got our food within N min of ordering , but ten minutes into our meal , she started pacing back and forth behind our table , checking to see if we were done . it was probably a bonus if you wanted something from a waiter ( they were really good about refilling our water ) , but a little too annoying for me . if the food weren ' t so darn delicious , i ' d probably never come back . p . s . the regular spice is pretty spicy . 
great classic jersey hot dogs . they use thumanns dogs and they taste great good service clean place i ' ll be back
get the omakase chef selection ! ! ! freshest sushi sashimi i ' ve had imported from all over the world . the grean tea creme brulee is a must have too . they don ' t take reservations so get there early around N-Npm to avoid long wait times . 
sanford ' s is definitely a good neighborhood spot . it ' s my go-to place when i ' m too lazy to cook but feeling too fancy for takeout . i ' m usually afraid of places with a really big menu , but for all the different things they make i ' ve never had anything bad there . it ' s a nice environment , service is attentive , and they have a very good beer and wine list for the neighborhood . my favorite dishes there calamari arrabiata , mushroom risotto , yellowfin tuna salad , steak salad . drawbacks it ' s a small place , so during busier periods it ' s tough to get a table . i also find it to be chilly inside . bring a sweater . 
better than trellis , but thats not saying much the menu is ameture . you can tell it was created by a hobbyist , and not a chef . it has no congruity or flow , too much variety with not enough total items available . the food tends to be either really unhealthy ( fatty , salty , fried , cheesed , gravy ' d , etc ) , or bland and unpalletable . there is not a single healthy option on the menu besides a side of carrots and celery ( mind you , it comes with blue cheese dressing ) . i have purchased several different meals from here , both dine-in and take-out , and have yet to be pleased with anything . add to this the fact that the food is priced as if it is balducci or cittorella quality , yet delivered closer to mcdonalds quality and this place is not for the hungry . the drink selection is reasonable , prices are reasonable during happy hour . besides the drinks , the only thing this place has going for it are the cute girls that work there ( they cant wait tables , but they are friendly and nice to look at ) , hiring young cuties seems to be the only good business decision the owner has made . my advice is to eat a sandwich at home and hit this Nnd rate hooters for cheap o pitchers of coors light . then jump on the tram and hit the strip club for a nite-cap . my advice for the owner is to firre the chef , hire a professional , write a real " grown up " menu , and feature N distinct healthy entree options . also establish a complete prix fixed brunch menu that includes a morning drink and coffee , and choices of decent options , for under N and youll get my business back . 
grimaldis pretty unassuming from the outside and a bit dark on the inside and could easily be missed . we went there based on the tripadvisor score and it was right on ! it was four of us and we ordered two small specialty coal fired pizzas , the ron and paul young ( meatball , sausage peppers ) and another variety . get the pizza with both green and hot peppers , it was delicious and we left there stuffed . you will not be disappointed at this place . we also saw another party near to us having the oven baked chicken wings that looked deelicious ! if you are in the ft . lauderdale area , don ' t miss anthony ' s . 
yammmiiii . this place did it for me , great food , great service . i am big on halal meats , and they certainly delivered . decor was not up my alley , hence N stars , but food was amazing . dosa for the win ! 
my husband and i dined at this place for valentine ' s day . the ambience was well setup for the day with a special menu as well . there was a long wait for the tables so making a reservation was well worth the time . plus points of this place - thai chef ' s dumplings - great as appetizer but had too much pork than shrimp . french onion soup - out of this world ! ! best i ' ve tasted so far . pad thai veg - this was done well but was lacking the spice factor that my husband wanted . pan fried shrimp with rice - the shrimp with light garlic sauce was good too . on the menu was a special dessert - red cake marinier souffle which was the hot pick that night . it was rich , creamy and delicious end to a looong dinner . ambience at front desk and one of the corridors is great . but then the tables look a bit cramped though . negatives - the restaurant was short of staff , waiters took a long time to reach your table for placing the orders , the wait for each dish was so long that we were snoozing by dessert time ( kidding ! ) we went by N . N and reached home by N . hope it was only the v day long wait . 
the owners are always happy and pleasant ! ! the food always taste amazing ! ! it is very busy on the weekends so i suggest put in a to-go order at least N mins in advance . lunch portions are on the small side but dinner portions are a good size . 
on a recent trip to new york , i found this place via yelp . wow . . . did yelp do me right ! we didn ' t experience the big long waits like i see in the photos , but we did have some of the best pizza i ' ve ever had . . . . friendly staff , great pizza and it was all reasonably priced too ! ! i would add this to my list of " must do " places next time in nyc . 
the tuna and habanero corn salad were great , the plantains were dry . the waitress appeared to want to be elsewhere so the service was dismal . 
happy to note that empire diner still maintains the ambiance of a greasy spoon , while being decidedly cleaner and more up-to-date . on a thursday night , the wait wasn ' t too long we had to wait under twenty minutes to get a table . the menu is small , but promising . a modern ( in some cases , luxe ) twist is given to traditional diner fare . for example , there ' s the matzo ball soup with bone marrow . decadence ladled in a bowl . between my husband and i we split the turnips in butter , the lemon chicken , and the patty melt . for dessert , we went with the rice pudding parfait . turnips were succulent and silky , with just the right crunchiness . the lemon chicken was served with ricotta , charred lemon , and roasted baby carrots . the textures and flavors were heavenly the portions just right . a nice addition was the garnish of crispy chicken skin . the patty melt was juicy and delightful , and came with some excellent house-made chips ( taro , potato , and beet ) . the rice pudding parfait was light and creamy . all in all , an excellent dining experience that makes me quite forgiving of the slow service . after all , they ' re still a fledgling restaurant and haven ' t been open for long but with chef freitag ' s capable hands steering this ship , it ' s bound to be smooth-sailing . 
delicious , dirty little dumpling spot in chinatown ! went here last night with my cousin and boy did we get our grub on and all for under ten dollars ! don ' t come here if you ' re looking for a nice , sit-down restaurant as they have no tables . don ' t come here if you ' re easily grossed out by dive restaurants . do come here if you want tasty pork dumplings ( warning , they do not have soup steamed dumplings ) , dirt cheap prices and super friendly dumpling chefs . must try the seaseme beef pancake ! filled with delicious cilantro , pickled carrots , beef wrapped in a thick seaseme crusted pancake . can ' t beat the N price . love the soy sauce in the siracha bottles . can ' t wait to come back after a long night of partying . me hungry ! heard the line can get nasty long so go on an off day or late in the evening . ( its across from a middle school ) . 
i cant put my finger on why i dont like going to this place . i used to love it . maybe the lazy service makes me feel like the people who prep the food are just as lazy and that gives me a gross feeling ? maybe because i always get a stomach ache and think that it must be that the food is not fresh ? i ' ve never hated the food . its okay . 
we went for my husband ' s birthday and we have the worst experience ever . he ordered ceviche . right after the first bite , he pulled out hairs of his mouth . the staff and the manager did not handle the situation at all . we waited N min before someone get back to us after he showed his plate . then the manager make us wait again ( i do not really why ) . we finally decided to leave no matter what . i asked for the check . we waited again . . . N minutes later the waitress came back and told us we do not have to pay the cocktails and the appetizers . . . so disappointing ! what about all the good reviews and the prizes seriously ? ! 
my friend and i have created this unofficial " tradition " of going for asian eats after drinking at our local watering hole . we were too lazy to walk to tasty hand-pulled and had heard good things about super taste . hence , we ended up there . decor and signage is minimal so it ' s easy to overlook . however , we all know that ' s usually the sign of a solid , authentic place . there are about eight tables ( if that ) and it ' s about the size of someone ' s living room . menus and pictures are posted on the walls , advertising regular items and specials . most of the dishes are noodle soups , as one might expect , and are rather inexpensive . i ordered knife-pulled noodles with pork . my friend ordered the hand-pulled noodles with beef . we also decided to split an order of dumplings . the food came out quickly . each bowl was garnished with a healthy dose of spinach but mine benefited from the addition of a little hot sauce . the noodles were good but not as springy as i ' d have liked . i actually preferred my friend ' s hand-pulled noodles and regretted not ordering the same . dumplings were good and there were plenty for sharing . i couldn ' t finish my soup so i got the rest to go and found the bowls also served as the take-out containers , which was convenient . service was okay but nothing stellar however , i didn ' t go in with the same expectation as a high-end joint , and neither should you . after sampling here , i still prefer tasty , lam zhou , etc . , but this is obviously a perfectly formidable choice if you ' re in the area . 
can i give a no star rating ? lets find out . honestly , i cant believe i ' m reviewing this shithole before pats , but here we are , first of all , never go here , ever ! for one thing ( and never forget this ) pats invented the cheese steak and at some point after that genos opened across the street . i have been to both pats and genos and i did always enjoy the og better , plus pats does not burn your fucking retinas in the way genos does . you can argue that being in america , people should speak english , sure , but they dont always and the owners forefathers didnt and maybe in new jersey where that ass lives , everyone does , but in south philly where i live and where lots of mexicans live and where there are a shit ton of tourists from other countries not everyone does , so deal with it . anyway , this place has a cheese steak as lousy as anywhere , and its about as real as mexican food from taco bell . i hope i can keep one philadelphian or tourist from visiting this copycat craphole . turns out , i do have to give at least one star . 
the bagel box has solid bagels that are chewy on the outside and doughy on the inside . the pumpernickel is particularly flavorful . i ' m surprised that this place hasn ' t won any local awards . most of the other local bagel joints in essex county have soft bagels that lack a chewy exterior . overall , the bagel box ' s bagels not as good as the best in manhattan , but are still a solid , delicious , and closer option . 
unfortunately my burger was undercooked and the order was wrong . they fixed it but i was disappointed . 
i ' m really surprised there is only one review on carmine ' s famous italian deli . maybe people that have great taste don ' t yelp ? sad . . this place is the best italian food you can get in the nation . hands down . they ' re sandwiches and entrees are all authentic . rumor has it they get their ingredients imported from italy but who knows ? carmine is the best place to get authentic italian food . i ' m living in chicago now and i have yet to find a deli up to carmine ' s standards . ughh it ' s frustrating to find good italian food decently priced . i usually get the N cheese sandwich with turkey and focaccia bread or the lasagna . ya know why it ' s good ? because they pack on the cheese and meat ! maybe that ' s the secret people ! 
great place for happy hour ! my friends and i hang out on the rooftop deck at least once a week in the summer . you have to get the seared tuna , they do it right ! the shrimp calamari is fun , it ' s cooked very light and crispy ! the shoestring fries are pretty cool and great to share . i ' ve also been to the continental midtown for breakfast . their breakfast dishes are tasty and not overwhelming . oh , and you gotta love their bloody mary ' s ! not too spicy but very flavorful and fresh tasting , they hit the spot ! 
basket seats ! ! ! ! ! ! sooo fun to sit in them while dining . great date place ! i ' ve eaten here maybe N times , and each time i had a great experience . the staff is warm and friendly and really knows the menu . they have many vegetarian options other than salads , which is always awesome to see ! i brunch-ed here once and loved the food -- the prices were also a little less . the rooftop bar is a great sips spot and fun on evenings , too . definitely try the champagne-o-rama ! while the prices are on the higher side , the experience makes up for it . it ' s a great place to take philly visitors to because it offers it all -- great ambiance , great food , great drinks . it can get crowded , but unfortunately they don ' t take reservations . 
was in nyc on vacay and had to check out the spotted pig having heard such fabulous things about it . . . . and am so incredibly glad i did ! of all the places we hit in the city , this was definitely my fav and the one that exceeded my expectations . we put our name for the anticipated N hour wait and headed to one of the local bars for a drink as the bar at sp was a little too packed for us . regardless , upon arriving back they seated us right away . the service was great . . super friendly and helpful , as we had lots of questions about the menu but the thing that stood out here was defintely the food . . . oh the food . . it was crazy delicious ! we have lots of really good gastropubs here in southern cal but i have to say the food here was the best i ' ve ever had at a gastropub . we started out with the devils on horseback and the ricotta gnudi . . . both were delish and loaded with flavor . we were pretty hungry so these did a perfect job of taking the edge off our hunger while we waited for our entrees . next up was my friend ' s apple salad and my burger with the most amazingly delectable fries w garlic and rosemary . omg . . we could not stop eating these fries . . these were seriously the most flavorful fries i ' ve ever had in my life . the burger was also pretty damn amazing . . . and let ' s just say not a bite was left on the plate . - ) i highly suggest you make time for the spotted pig if visiting nyc . . . totally worth whatever the wait is . . . - ) 
i did go due to the hype , but i was not prepared at all for my experience . the brisket is ok . against my better judgement i ordered a not so fatty cut and a fatty cut . the fatty cuts of brisket were pretty good , but not any better than fette sau or any other decent place . the non-fatty parts . . . really , why bother ? that being said , the brisket is decent . it needs sauce , though . i know the owner is against the idea of sauce , but despite it ' s meaty flavor , it just needs another salt sweet tart component . that would have made it delicious . either way , let me start from the beginning . i knew that this place got pretty full , so i was sure to go before they opened . that being said , i got there N or so minutes before and encountered a line . that was fine and it wasn ' t too long , although there were N or so people ahead of me . i got to the place and made sure that i put my name down . the first thing they asked was , " did you pre-order your brisket ? " really ? apparently you can call and reserve to get there before the restaurant opens . they don ' t say this on their website , but this is ridiculous . all of us normal patrons waited outside until the restaurant opened . when they opened , there were still people eating inside . . . so that meant they started to trickle in the normal patrons after those people left . there was a line outside for people waiting to get in . once you ' re done with that line , there is another internal line before you get your table . there was only one person dealing with the cutting . the menu was positioned in a way where you only knew what your options are once you got up front . the whole process was so inefficient . once we got inside , we waited on the last line and that took N minutes . the outside line took around N-N minutes . overall during the entire time there we spotted at least N tables that seat N people open at all times . they are clearly not managing the flow of people . once you get up front and order , you get to take unlimited pieces of bread . we also didn ' t have any problem sitting down after waiting for over an hour . ( after getting to the restaurant N minutes before open time . ) for all that , the food was mediocre . i might wait over an hour for ippudo ( and the last time i did that , that was no longer transcendent either ) , but not this mediocre brisket . they should institute more of a fette sau policy in letting people find their own tables instead of a host not letting people in from outside . the table management left a lot to be desired . 
i eat out every night in new haven because i don ' t own any food . this is by far the best value in town you can get half orders of food that are still great portion sizes for half the price . the outdoor patio is great during the summer . friendliest staff in town . this is by far the best value deal in new haven . 
came back here and i forgot how good this place is . it ' s affordable and delicious , which is the best combo isnt it ? i got the bacon slider with cheese and onions . i tried putting a dot of jalape o , chipotle , and barbecue sauce in one bite-full . but it ' s good by itself too . oh and get the guinness shake . it doesn ' t really taste like a guinness . . more like a creamy vanilla based milk shake with a hint of the guinness bitter at the end ? it ' s hard to describe but if you like milk shakes or guiness you should try it . 
it ' s true the lychee martinis are good . and for the price , even better . also tried the bamboo and agave . bamboo wasn ' t really my style , but it might be yours . agave has a kick of hot pepper to it . unique . i enjoyed it . 
cute spot . the food is very good . the portions are large . i know the food isn ' t traditional korean , but the fusion works perfectly . i ' ll be back . 
sometimes i think the food and atmosphere at a restaurant can be so wonderful that the monotone carelessness of a server really stands out . our reservation was at N N , they sat us at N because we were early . the floor-length windows were open , the place was buzzing with tourists and locals alike . my mother and her friends were visiting me in my home of philadelphia . they raved over the bread , but i will rave over the mussels . they raved over the cr me br l e , but i will rave over the perfectly constructed cappuccino . everything was decadent , except the less-than-pleasant server we were constantly searching for . i ' ve worked in the food industry for quite a while and tried to give her the benefit of the doubt , but she was not on par with the food . the only thing that saved her was the servers nearby who always noticed when our water was low and stopped by to check on us . loved the place , but i sincerely hope that the little lady was just having a rough day . 
great stop for a quick breakfast or deli style lunches . wonderful soups . sandwiches are generous and made with good quality fillings - some unusual combinations , but all very tasty ! service is the friendliest in town ! 
this place is my go-to sushi place in philly . the first time i came here i splurged on a sushi boat for N with my friend . i think i teared up a little when i took a bite of their salmon . i can literally write an essay about how their salmon is so fatty , tender , and melts in your mouth like butter but that wouldn ' t be reasonable . their sushi presentation is beautiful of course , and their quality of fish is probably one of the best . other than the food their interior is chic , but a little small which should be a warning to all of you so make sure you always reserve ! 
terrible . the service was horrible . the head waiter was rude , and refused to allow us to sit in the place because there was a " no stroller " policy , even after our waiter told us we could . this was at N N in the afternoon with N people eating in the dining area and about N , N square feet of empty space . we left . i came from the upper west side with my daughter to meet some friends . what a waste of a subway ride . i will never go to this place again . stay away . stay far away . wish i could give negative stars . 
we went for our Nth anniversary as most of the restaurants in our area are closed during stick season or still closed from irene ( e . g . , the common man , hen of the woods ) . service was fine and the appetizers ( mussels and a cheese plate ) were great , but the both entrees ( salmon and ny strip ) were so salty it overwhelmed the flavor of the food . it was the first time i ' ve had mushrooms that tasted more like salt than butter or mushrooms . the steak was stringier and chewier than we ' re used to with vermont steak . the vesper cocktail was perfect . we did not stay for dessert . this was not a good choice for a special occasion . 
the staff here are very friendly and pretty ! which always helps ! the menu was a bit limited , and the food did take a bit longer than you would like . i don ' t mind a delay sometimes , and it was delicious , we enjoyed every bite ! 
pies-n-thighs catered our wedding in september . we knew we wanted delicious hearty food and that pnt would have great fried chicken . but they surpassed our expectations by miles . from our first exchange until the day after our wedding ( they provided delicious and amazing looking donuts the morning after ) they were so professional , warm and generous . the food at our wedding was presented beautifully and was sublime . i can ' t tell you how many times i heard " best food at any wedding ever ! " from our guests . they also offered a perfect variety and a nice balance between yummy fried fish and chicken to tasty , healthy and colorful vegetables and salads . and people are still talking about the pies and how great they were . as for the service anne marie is the events coordinator that we worked with and she truly went above and beyond . she took such interest and care in how our day played out and was an absolute delight to work with . the chefs also showed so much care and it was clear that everyone wanted our day to be great and for us to be happy . the servers that helped at our wedding were so kind , so professional and did a perfect job . honestly , i could go on and on about what a special and wonderful experience we had with pies-n-thighs . i will continue to dine in their restaurant and use their catering services and wish we could do the wedding all over again exactly the same way ! 
my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our meal last night . we had the tasting menu which was very reasonably priced in my mind for N super delicious and innovative dishes ( N ) . the wines were very good and we appreciated the N . N ounce pour which was only N . N more than half the price of a regular N ounce glass since we got to try a number of different wines . the timing of the food was excellent and the wait staff very polished and attentive . the ambience was exceptional and unusual in that the restaurant was relatively quiet even when full . only negative was that with the ambience comes a very dark table where it is difficult to see the superlative dishes . i think a low wattage lamp on the table would solve that problem . 
i ' ve had both good and bad experiences here . normally i will go here for brunch ( most likely influenced by a groupon ) . . the food seems like it should be good , but sometimes small oversights bring it down . one that stands out is wraps that are served wet on the bottom . that being said , it is worth a shot if you are getting a deal . 
visited ziggy ' s and was awesome to walk in . lots of tv ' s , pool tables , huge bar . sat down at a high top table and got menus right away . huge selection of beers on tap and i could not decide so ordered a four beer sampler along with our meals . beer was good and cold . finished sampler , but no sign of meal . people walked in after us and got their food while we still waited . polished off another beer when the sampler was done , wife had a second beer . . . . still no sign of food . after N minutes was asked for our meal or the check . check came , never saw the meal . paid , left , zero tip . will never return . if only i could do less than one star . . . . . . . 
this was pretty disappointing , especially after all the praise . the food was blandly prepared . it lacked both careful preparation and design . my girlfriend had the watermelon salad , which sounded like a nice idea , but in the end seemed more like an experiment by a college student . my burger was terrible , totally undercooked and unremarkable with the english muffin as a bun . the whole place reminded me of being a kid and trying out " new " ideas for foods by mixing things that simply do not go together , in spite of best intentions . the only thing that saved this restaurant from a lower score was that the wait staff could tell how disgruntled i was and brought along a dish of chocolate mousse , on the house . and that was actually rather tasty . but the overall experience was not deeply improved . 
dessert drinks N . N stars we went to beau monde for drinks and dessert . we had a classic crepe-- nutella bananas hazelnut ice cream . if you aren ' t a regular ' crepe eater ' , i would highly recommend starting with this dessert . it ' ll have you coming back for more . i look forward to trying beau monde for dinner soon . as far as drinks-- i am a huge fan of ' dark and stormy ' ( s ) rum and ginger beer . their dark and stormy was on point . the blueberry mojito was fantastic too . location N . N stars in a good little spot but a little off the beaten path at Nth and bainbridge . service N . N stars price N . N stars ambiance N . N stars a very well decorated and classically french style restaurant . with l ' etage upstairs , you get a great night in one spot . overall N . N stars definitely recommend going to beau monde for a pre-party and then up to l ' etage lounge with dance floor and more good drinks . i ' m excited to try beau monde for dinner or lunch on a sunny day . 
before the holidays i went into this place with a girlfriend , who wanted to get some of the spiced , dried meats , for presents . ( an unusual , but lovely stocking stuffer . ) while waiting for her packages , on a whim i ordered the chili hot chocolate . although it might sound like an oxy-moron , the hot chocolate laced with chili pepper was the perfect amount of sweet spicy , and was the perfect treat for a day of errands in the freezing cold . as i paid for my hot cocoa , two pies in the display case caught my eye maple bacon apple , and ginger snap pumpkin . too intrigued to resist , i ordered both to bring to my holiday dinner . the bacon apple was interesting , and the pumpkin was the best i have ever had . since then , i have eaten lunch here twice , and each time i found my food to be outstanding . even though things are on the pricier side , and it is not a good place to go if time is a concern , the quality of food makes everything worthwhile . 
this place had great burgers . i would come back again . 
a little diner located in the west end , they make pretty decent fruit pancakes . i ' d go there if i wanna be cheap
that first time at obao . omg ! ! ! nice place excellent food . i order rib sugar cane so yummy calamari love it pad thai so good grill pork shrimp i would like to come back here with my friend again . 
for as classy as this place looks and sophistication of the wait staff , i was unimpressed with the food . i found it pretty common and bland . i do have to say the porscuitto and figs appetizer was very tasty
i have been a regular at lou ' s for a while . service has changed and so has the whole " lou ' s " atmosphere . portions used to be huge and delicious . now the portions are significantly smaller . N starts because i know lou ' s potential and still go there atleast N times a week . 
i like this place . i try to hit it for some of their wings and bar burgers . the folks there are friendly . i go there mostly to as a dinner meeting while i am in town for business and it is quiet enough for some good conversation . 
i ' ll preface this by saying i love barbeque and i have been spoiled by the good stuff in memphis for years . that being said , the food was just okay . the bbq was just not as flavorful as i ' m used to and the meat was kind of tough . the sides were decent overall but nothing special . service was atrocious . we got seated out on the back patio area quickly enough but after that it was twelve minutes before our drink order was taken . seven minutes for those drinks to come out . another five before our food order was taken because we had to order from our server , not the person who brought out the drinks . then two of us got food while the third order took an extra twenty minutes and we had to go inside to find someone to ask about it . when they finally brought out the third order there was no acknowledgement of the fact that sliders had taken forty-five minutes to be made . don ' t think this memphis bbq girl will be back . 
great tasting mexican food , excellent service , very friendly . would recommend to anyone . 
yet another place where i go play poker ! i go there almost every monday to enjoy a nice free texas hold ' em poker tournament with primetime league . i like rogues gallery service and food . in general , they are quick and the quantity and quality of the food is great . i had the vegetarian burger , the grilled chicken burger and tots ( not all at once ! ) and everything was very tasty . i am not a vegetarian and i don ' t generally order veggie burger but this one was very tasty and had consistency . i would go back there even if it was not for poker ! tips be careful , the red sauce with the tots is not ketchup ! ! 
probably one of the worst bbq meals i ' ve ever had . or rather tried , because i did not finish it . on the recommendation of the bartender ordered to go texas style beef rib plate ( N ) . should have looked in the bag . instead of tender ribs , i was greeted by one big bone of tough and burned meat . the mashed potatoes were loaded with pepper that killed any kind of taste ( or covered the bad taste ) . the sweet mashed potatoes were full of indigestible strings . i don ' t think i ' ll even try the banana pudding . was excited to have some bbq , but instead will be calling my credit card company to get my money back . really disappointing ! 
i ' m new to the city and have been looking fairly vigorously for a local bar . its difficult to wander around and keep up the pace of finding the next great restaurant in a city where things come and go like flies on a dead carcass . i want a staple go-to where people are friendly and drinks and food are good . basically , i want cheers , only a higher end version with a few more patrons . on friday night , i found it . the place was packed at around N . my friend and i squeezed up to the bar to get a drink and , fortunately for us , a seat . i flipped through the menu and gazed longingly at the tons of scotch on the shelves behind the bar . the bartender told me it was a scottish bar . owners and all . it all came together . the food , the scotch , the cocktails ( many scotch-based ) . service was good and friendly despite the incredible mass of people clamoring toward the bar in the well designed " industrial-quaint " space . servers were attractive and incredibly nice throughout the night . drinks were reliably good blood sand , a manhattan ( stirred ) and a highland park N with a beer ( a " gentlemen ' s boilermaker " , i was told by the barkeep ) and some sort of glorified pig in a blanket to sop it all up ( forgot the name of the dish , but it was delicious ) . definitely worth a visit . 
great place to kick off after work and enjoy a drink , with your friends
tashan was really great . i went there for happy hour and had drink . i later tried the chef ' s tasting menu . i really like their selection of wine . not your typical indian restaurant as it serves beef . try the waygu beef . i think i could eat that everyday ! 
great food ! love the atmosphere and dinning area . 
sunday brunch is a staple in nyc and i think jane ' s is up there with the best . whenever i go out to new york i have to stop in and grab a couple cocktails and my crab-cakes benedict . so amazing and worth the wait - because there is always a wait . can ' t wait to go back ! ) 
best place for a quick quick lunch . they are fast and all i care about during Nmin lunch break is my food should be fast and eatable and pei wei delivers it ( most of the time ) . so i go here often . 
if i had never eaten risotto before i would have concluded that i disliked it . easily the worst risotto i have ever had . a plate of mush . any home cook could make a vastly better risotto blind-folded . 
despite it ' s distant location ( Nst ave in the les ) , i would gladly venture to this restaurant for the fresh dough and fresh mozzarella found in each pie . the varietal selections offered by luzzo ' s can appease any pizza fan . what make ' s luzzo ' s special is their ability to harness balance between all elements in each slice of pizza . as with the margherita , the balance of buffalo mozzerella , dough crust , basic tomato sauce , and basil all combine to make a perfect pie . 
great burgers , great fries , great sauces , and phenomenal service . 
hmmm . this place is really good for certain situations . it ' s seriously cheap in a way that ' s tough to find in the neighborhood , so it ' s good for take out or going with friends when you ' re all broke . the food is straightforward and decent . the atmosphere is kind of trying to hard to be trendy or something , and the service was really unfriendly , although really fast . you kind of feel like you ' re being pushed in and out as fast as possible because with those cheap prices , they ' ll only make money if they can turn over customers quickly . so there ' s some pros and cons , but overall a good place to have in the neighborhood ! 
hello
i go here every time i go downtown , i try to avoid lunch hour since that time is immensely crowded and cant sit anywhere , but i like variety of food and other things that make it what it is , there is actually just one place in the entire market that i dont like that is a bar type atmosphere , my out of town friend wanted to go there , we sat down and they told us we had to order a drink a piece , i dont drink and they told me i had to leave , so after she created a scene we left , but other than that i do like the market . 
very decent food however not super impressive with the price . the two of us spent N and were barely full walking out . 
to set the context for this review , i ' m from the bay area , so i consider myself somewhat of an asian food connoisseur . where i ' m from , there are dozens of vietnamese restaurants just a quick drive away , and then there ' s always my trusty friend lee ' s sandwiches , which was literally right down the street . so , i honest-to-goodness thought that i knew what banh mi tasted like . i liked it , but it has never been anything spectacular to me . just a cheap , easy alternative . asian fast food . so i can say with complete honesty and without exaggeration that my first bite into banh mi saigon ( N , with bbq pork ) was a life changing experience . i can ' t describe how amazing this sandwich is . the bread is perfectly toasted and buttery . the veggies are fresh , crispy and crunchy . the bbq pork is perfectly seasoned and so flavorful . also , it is extremely cheap . i think this tops the charts for cheap eats in nyc . i think they used to be N . N per sandwich and it is now N . N . many times i find myself at the register thinking about whether i should buy N or N for myself ( one to eat there and another N-N to take home and eat later ) . the only problem is that they close at Npm daily . it ' s so sad . i can only get there on weekends . note if you want to eat these delicious banh mis later , they will also wrap up the veggies for you separately so that you can toast the bun and meat and add the veggies in . it tastes just as good . also , cash only ! i die , banh mi saigon , i die . you are so good . you are magical . you are so yummy . i love you beyond words can express ! 
who can go wrong with a place that encompasses all that is bacon ? we went there last saturday and got there at N . just N of us and there was no wait . i started off with the " bloody piggy " which was basically an average bloody mary with a slice of bacon in it . wasn ' t a bad bloody mary but nothing special besides the bacon . for the next round ( s ) of drinks my husband and i ordered their bourbon and whiskey cocktails which were really great ! we started with the bacon tasting . didn ' t realize that N tasting would come with N slices of each different bacon so we ordered N tastings which was way too much . but it ' s bacon so we ate it , duh . then we each got the grilled cheese that was on the specials board which was fantastic ! we usually get N different entrees and share but the grilled cheese just sounded so good . we also got the tater tots with bacon salt . they taste just like regular old tater tots to me . . . not that there ' s anything wrong with that . . . also , no pop music like some people mentioned in other reviews . . . oldies and classic rock which i enjoyed . i love the concept , and the prices are reasonable . oh and duh , great service too . will definitely be back ! 
in preparation for the big move to tel aviv , i came to zahav to check out their israeli cuisine and was very pleasantly surprised . first off - the menu has two options for tasting menus . option N choose one dish from each of three categories , plus salatim and hummus and a dessert ( N ) . option N the true chef ' s tasting , in which the chef picks all your meals ( including their feature lamb dish ) - N . if you go a la carte , they recommend N-N dishes per person , plus salatim hummus . . . this isn ' t really true . most people would have trouble finishing this much food . we ordered the salatim hummus starter , N small dishes and N main dishes ( all to share for N people ) . this was really filling and didn ' t leave room for dessert . my favorite dishes- the beets with tahini ( part of the salatim ) , fried cauliflower , crispy haloumi , and the " turk " main dish ( similar to the middle eastern kefta ) . other pointers the side room is a bit more quiet than the main room . reservations are a must . arak is an acquired taste . . . only order if you like anise-flavored drinks ( like j ger , ouzo , absinthe , etc . . ) 
easily one of my favorite steakhouses ! unlike all other restaurants , they dont make you full by serving you a lot of bread or appetizers , they start serving you the good stuff ! the steaks are served to you whenever you want so you can literally only eat steak the entire meal . also , their steaks are great quality and delicious . there are so many to choose from it ' s really cool and easily one of my favorite places to go . i love the idea of having so many servers bring you fresh steak thats warm and juicy straight from the kitchen and you dont have to eat appetizers or anything . absolutely awesome . 
not really feeling any spark in this relationship . maybe gonna break up . better food and energy easily found in the hood now . 
as far as their burgers are concerned , b b rocks ! ! ! ! love their " bash style " burger , the beef patty is so juicy , succulent and flavorful ! ! ! so yummy ! the burger is served with american cheese , caramelized onions and bacon jam , which added a touch of complexity to otherwise purist style burger . it was just as good as dbgb ( and cheaper ! ) ! ! reminded me of my favorite in out burger , but with more style . i read a complaint about size being too big , but for me it was perfectly sized ! the accompanying fries were crisp and tasty , and weren ' t too greasy . hands down one of the best burgers in town ! ! ! ! i also loved the idea of eating scrumptious gourmet burger in a dark and sexy space ! it ' s totally worth N , skip minetta tavern ' s N black label burger and just come here instead ! ! ! no bouncer and stupid red velvet rope here , and the ambiance is just as classy and chic ! can ' t wait to go back ! ! ! 
definitely the best capuccino and the best tiramisu ever . the traditional tiramisu is good enough , but their tiramisu di san dona is heavenly they serve the homemade ladyfingers along with a bowl of mascarpone pudding , and a bowl of espresso . it is a deconstructed , do it yourself type of tiramisu , and repeating it is amazing . 
working in jersey isn ' t so bad . especially not when you get to explore new restaurants , though some are not as appealing or desirable as churrasco grill ( case in point , olive garden . . . ) churrasco grill is a small , family owned restaurant , and it ' s obvious that the diners know the owner and vice versa . there is always a gentleman who brings in his own bottle of white , and sips it while enjoying his lunch and some papers . us , well , we go for the roast chicken . it ' s a huge portion , and roasted well , nice flavors and definitely filling . the food definitely warrants a N . N star - reason i ' m rounding down ? except for when i ' m working in jersey , i don ' t think ( as good as the chicken is ) it ' s something i ' ll crave and come back for . great restaurant if you ' re in the neighborhood though . 
loved the food presentation at this joint . i bought a yelp deal which was great . the place is a bit expensive in comparison to the amount of food you get though . i bought the " ceviche for two in a coconut " thing . . . . and it was not for two people . it barely fills up one person . but on the plus side it is reallllllllly well presented to you . hint great for a date . the place is small , but not too tight . plus the bartender ( male ) and waitress were really sweet . while i ' ve definitely had better experiences , i would go back if i had to . 
this is one of those pizza places i ' ve never been to , the one that ' ll someday be a chapter in an art history book and a plaque on an iron fence . i went in on a rainy saturday night and i was looking at all the faces , because it ' s all artists lofts around there and i thought , maybe some guy here ' s a sculptor who ' s been working with granite all day and he ' s tired and taking a nice girl to this hipster pizza place , and also in the back of his mind he ' s thinking about this one piece of rock that ' s been bugging him . how to cut it ? and he ' s drinking some wine . and roberta ' s is just one of those places that ' s so right he takes it for granted . like if he moves to san francisco , he ' ll be walking someday across an empty street and he ' ll realize that things had never been as good as they were then , when he was sculpting days and eating nights with his girl at roberta ' s . 
best thai food in the city , hands down . and be warned , it will spoil every other thai place for you . the food is legit . it ' s fresh , it ' s flavorful , and it ' s delicious . although everything i ' ve had here has been amazing the curries are the standout to me . they make their pastes fresh daily and it shows . my favorite is the panang curry . . . it packs a punch but you can still taste the components with just a dollop of coconut cream gracing the top . it ' s really special . their tom yum is really amazing and you ' ll probably never want to order it elsewhere after having it . sripraphai is definitely worth the trek out to queens . service is quick and efficient and gives you plenty of time to hit up the asian supermarkets nearby and stock up on necessities . 
this and room service are easily my favorite thai places in the area . it was previously called ember room but although the name has changed the combination of amazing quality of the food and drinks , affordable prices and excellent service has not . obao is really fun to come to with a group or just another person to catch up . they have innovative thai and vietnamese dishes that full of flavor and really good . the drinks are some of the best i ' ve had recently they have a full list of creative cocktails i ' d recommend the smoke signal and the bruiseberry mojito . my favorite dish is the pad kra prow but most thing ' s i ' ve tried are very good . they ' re also michelin recommended and they mark the specific dishes michelin decided to recommend . the reason i come here more than room service is because ember room obao is on a really cool program called foodfan select so i get a discount on my full bill every time i come which definitely makes me feel better about the inevitable extra rounds of drinks . 
luzzo ' s is the pizza in new york . it rocks ! 
i ' ve always wanted to try this place out because everyone was raving about how good it was . i tried it out and it was nothing special . they are known for their different dipping sauces but each sauce is N . N . i ordered five different sauces to try out and i did not like any of them . the fries were a bit soggy when i got them and i was not impressed . three stars for creativity for the different types of dipping sauce . 
very excellent selection of craft beers , plus they make a nice dark stormy . the food is pretty good , the mac cheese is a nice touch while the sandwiches are quite tasty - and their fries are the thin and flavorful . casual place for hanging out and drinking some brews . the service was great and the bartender knowledgable a must with the selection they carry . 
simply put a lot of money for not that much . slow service and over cooked extra salty food . seasoning is one thing but this is a whole new level . 
have been here half a dozen times or so and each time the food and the service were tied for excellence . we have been welcomed every time , fussed over , patiently allowed to linger at the buffet and at dinner served with friendliness and attentiveness . even the water glass was kept filled . the food is delicious and plentiful and this is fast becoming one of my favorite restaurants . 
who a girl who is a cheap ass and a chinese man who works for the prosperity dumplings what their infamous-and-steal-deal N dumplings for a buck when one lovely spring evening where N eldridge st , chinatown , nyc why because it is krazy good and cheap how misunderstanding it was right before the dusk . she realized that she skipped the lunch to do window shopping all day . truth be told , she ' s broke . although she had an unlimited metro card , she decided to walk down from gramercy to chinatown . truth be told , she ' s one fat ass . what a convo . she gained her weight almost drastically since she has no man to go out with . wait , how miserable is she ? being a broke , cheap , and a horny ass , there ' s the only choice left for her the prosperity dumpling . she has been here for numerous times sometimes with her ex , somethings with her gay lover , and most of the time , alone . anyone , could you hook this bitch up ? it wasn ' t that packed , maybe because it was still chilly outside . before her there was a dude who ordered N dumplings . she was gonna order only N , but all of a sudden she wants to compete with a stranger . so when her turn comes , she said " can i have fi . . fteen dumplings to go ? " she didn ' t actually say how many dumplings she wants clearly since that was a last minute mind change . when she got a container , it feels lighter , however , she thought she just lost some weight from her forearms so she left happy . when she opened a container on the street , she saw only N dumplings . she remembered what happened when she paid for a guy who took her order . she gave him N dollars and he gave her N dollars . she thought that was strange , but she left N dollars since she thought she had N dumplings in her container . when she came back , this chinese guy looked a bit surprised . she told him " look , i thought you gave me N dumplings , but you only gave me five " " you said five , right ? " said he . " no man , i said fifteen " she wasn ' t really accusing him since it ' s her own fault not to say how many dumplings she wanted clearly . " and i gave you N dollars bill . i left N dollars so i ' d like to get N more " this chinese man looks at her doubtfully and said " are you sure that was N dollars that you gave me ? " his doubtful look makes her think what she did but she was certain for it , so she said " yes " he added freshly made N dumplings in her container . since it wasn ' t so crowded , she was able to sit down in a tiny-closet-sized store . there is no surprise , but she finished those N dumplings in less than N minutes . 
while we love the food , the noise level was too high . sound-deadening material would help . 
great place to find eastern european groceries . if you are looking for old world authentic meats , this is the place . no frills , no sparkle , just good real food . they specialize in sausages . numerous kinds of kielbasa , kishka , several wursts , head cheeses , and other stuff i didn ' t know existed . they do whole roasts for parties ( pigs , lambs , goats ) . he also does custom game meat processing for hunters . a real treasure right here in hartford . 
i was a regular customer for a few years , and have noticed a definite decline in the quality of the food that began over a year ago , which had seemed to have been remedied a few months ago . unfortunately , my last trip to the restaurant yesterday revealed a continuation of the slide . . . our table ordered beef , pork , lamb , and fish dishes , and the only meat that could be identified by taste was the fish . the " beef " dish turned out to be a mistake by the waiter , and was pork . we hadn ' t been able to tell what the meat was from taste , but the color didn ' t look like beef . unfortunately , whatever method that was used to over-tenderize the pork and lamb meat in the three dishes also removed any trace of the taste of the meat . i have had several lamb dishes here before , and the lamb always had the characteristic lamb taste , but this time it was a very tender tasteless sponge . it is very frustrating to me that they provide an otherwise excellent dish ( vegetables and sauce were wonderful ) with tasteless , over cooked , unidentifiable meat . by the way , the fish dish was very good , but i am partial to lamb and beef dishes . also , a minor issue in light of the problems with three of the four main dishes , when the waiter was asked to refill our teapot , it took over N minutes , and the tea that was brought was ice cold , necessitating another wait . four years ago , i would have given this restaurant five stars , but it is now just a pale shadow of its former self . i am hoping they can turn the kitchen around again , but i ' m afraid they have had their three strikes in my case . i won ' t likely be returning . i will miss the ox tongue and tripe appetizer - it is easily my favorite szechuan dish , and is done very well here . . . but you can ' t make a meal of a very spicy starter dish . 
i dined at dragonfly with my boyfriend a few days ago . we were happy to find out that they had live jazz in their bar area which could be heard throughout the restaurant . they had a nice menu with a lot of great choices and a very creative drink list . we split a yummy bottle of sauvignon blanc for N which is really affordable for a restaurant . i had the crab topped salmon which was recommended by our waitress and loved it ! my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and was impressed by the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked . for dessert we split the fried cheesecake with ice cream and thoroughly enjoyed it . the atmosphere was lovely with different pieces of interesting decor throughout . the fish tank which was lit blue was cool looking although it needed some more fish for such a large tank . great new spot , we ' ll be back again . 
omg tacos ! there are few places with tacos like this in nyc ! cheap ! fresh ! delicious ! the only downside is no seating , though as long as it ' s not the weekend you ' ll find a spot in the market . every time i go to chelsea market , i plan to tey something new but i always fall back on los tacos , and am never disappointed . had the bahn mi place-that was a mistake . i prefer the chicken tacos , the pork are a little greasy fatty for my taste , but the husband loves the pork . get the chia and guacamole , and get yourself a fanta . it ' s the drink that goes with tacos ( assuming a beer is not an option ) . 
great burger with decent beer selections . been there twice in two weeks . the burgers are juicy but tried four of them ( finishing my wife ' s leftovers . . . . ) and they are not that different in taste . the host and servers were very friendly . but given the lack of variety and poor interior design i will give this place a four star . 
awesome food ! ! i keep going back ! ! great prices and byob . 
awesome bar ! ! ! service was great ! bartender ( steve ) was great . he had great beer recommendations , good restaurant suggestions and was totally business the entire night . he even had recommendations for a modern dance arts center in the w . village ( i ' m a dancer ) . awesome beer ! great vibe ! 
best restaurant in philadelphia . . . being there three times and every time i love it more . . chef plays with flavors and condiments in a very adventure and amazing way . this little byob is a philadelphia gem . we always paid around N- N per couple , which includes two appetizers , two entrees , and dessert . if you go to amada or zahav , you will end up paying the same and will leave the place starving . in kanella you will leave full and satisfy . we cannot get enough of this place . last week , we wanted to open one of the two bottles we have of N wine of the year , casa lapostolle clos apalta , and decided there were no better place to open this bottle than kanella . we were so right . service is awesome , love the touch of the owner chef always stopping by all the tables at the end of the night . very european , once you get a table it is yours for the night . no rush , just enjoy and bring a good bottle of wine because this place is worthy . 
i bought a groupon coupon for this restaurant to try it out . very glad i did . you never know what to expect when you try a new place but i highly recommend this place . very fresh flavorful food . tried the antipasto , calzone , and a meatball sub for my girlfriend . all were delicious , and full of flavor . will definitely go again ! ! ! i wanted to go the next day to get another calzone , but i ' ll wait until friday . 
i was really excited to try this place and join my fellow yelpers in its praises , but i left pies ' n ' thighs feeling confused and defeated confused because the food didn ' t knock my socks off , and defeated because i still hadn ' t found my perfect chicken waffles in ny . we came on a saturday night at around N N pm and were seated immediately in the middle of the restaurant , comprised of multiple little dining rooms . there was something kind of nice about sitting in this tiny shack room , which sat up to N people , and hearing the pitter patter of the rain on the roof . it took a while for our waiter to notice us i suspect that this has to do with the multiple small rooms that he had to tend to . the bf got the fried chicken box and a side of fries and i ordered the chicken waffles . don ' t get me wrong , the fried chicken was good and we were satisfied with the overall meal , but popeye ' s is good , too , and half the price . i found the waffles to be very dense , although i did appreciate the blueberries and cinnamon butter , and the biscuits just didn ' t wow me . we didn ' t finish our entr es , and opted instead to vary our meal with a banana cream pie to share per the recommendation of the waiter , which was definitely the highlight of the meal , but it alone will not be able to drag me out to williamsburg . there was really nothing bad about the experience it was decent , but i suppose i had gone in with too high expectations . 
i am amazed how many people decided to sign up for yelp just to give this brand new place N stars . we thought the food was ok . i do like places with " the " in their name - it gives them a sense of gravitas and exclusivity , so kudos for that . definitely a step up from other area bars . standard " rustic " chic that seems popular these days . " not just farm to table but actual farm table ! " 
order the falafel sandwhich w the hott sauce . 
the bloody marys here are the reason i get out of bed on sundays . 
good tacos
oh mundo , how i have missed you ! i ' m so incredibly happy to have you back and last night ' s dining experience made the N year wait worth it . the perfect , signature red sonya , the crazy delicious veggie wrap ( who knew something so seemingly simple could be that amazing ! ) , the ecclectic decor , and the attentive service will bring me back to mundo over and over again . though , admittedly , i should probably branch out and actually try some of the new things on the menu ) 
went to celebrate our son ' s birthday . there were N of us for dinner on sunday aug Nth . the staff was very friendly . we sat upstairs and we picked our table . the food was wonderful . we shared about N plates favorites were fried goat cheese , crispy brussel sprouts , lamb meatballs and octopus . the flavors were unique . pace yourselves- order a few plates , enjoy them then order a few more . . . . our waiter was friendly and attentive . we had vina ardanza with our plates . we all enjoyed something our waiter suggested it was like a spicey ravioli . oh so good . we will return ! 
i love cuban cuisine and had to try this place . the food was very good which i was pleased with , but unfortunately the service was slow and unattentive and that ruined my experience . i did sit out in their lounge area after dinner and that was nice . it ' s a very cozy and comfortable area to just sit and have a nice talk with friends . 
good cheesesteak fries ! had the meat been jucier it would have gotten N stars . very good fries . unique experience worth checking out . it was more expensive than i expected though . 
hands down favorite chinese spot in philadelphia . hot soup dumplings ! vegetable noodles ! could eat that every night of my life ! 
i thank the restaurant gods for fatty crab ' s new outpost in les . after the uws joint was closed , i just haven ' t been getting my fatty crab fill and i will do almost anything to avoid meat packing . food is delicious - in particular i was blown away by the mussels with fried chinese style buns and sweet chinese style sausage . as soon as they get their liquor license , they are going to blow up . one complaint they do not seem to have their kitchen vented properly yet - which creates a slight choke-effect in the dining area . i expect this will be righted shortly . 
based on other yelp reviews ( thanks ! ) i ordered the fabada which is a white bean stew with small bits of sausage and the pan catalan ( bread rubbed with tomato and garlic and topped with serrano ham ) . both were absolutely delicious and perfect for a cold , rainy winter night . if you like rose wine , the dry rioja rose was excellent . i saw many paella ' s passing by and they looked great . the place is not fancy and it is a bit noisy -you can hear your neighbors conversations loud and clear , but the prices are very good and the food is great . would like to see a few more tapas options on the menu but that is just a minor suggestion . when i go back , i will order exactly the same thing i had ! servers were busy but very nice ! 
don ' t believe the hype . food is ok . service . . . non existent . . . . . unless you are into that hipster get it yourself type of service . menu is overpriced . the lines to get into this place baffle me . i live in the neighborhood and the patrons that will stand in line to eat here are either masochistic or zagat readers . . . . this place reminds me a bit of the other tourist trap . . . . " serendipity " . there are so many amazing restaurants in the area . . . that to make a trip to eat here is like ordering the fish entree in a steak house . why ? 
the more i go to joe ' s shanghai , the more i like it . i don ' t even notice the neon diner lighting anymore . where else can you find such a variety of inexpensive , yet satisfying menu options ? the shrimp noodle soup is particularly good on cold days . i like the string bean szechuan style w pork , it goes well with rice . there ' s several other dishes i want to try such as shredded pork with pickled cabbage soup or ham winter melon soup . 
excellent pizza , good price . 
this place is a solid restaurant choice , but since it ' s the only restaurant on newkirk , it ' s packed every night . they have a great selection of classic americana dishes - it ' s a standard neighborhood spot with comfort food . they have a great brunch . 
i wish i could review the food but unfortunately i was never able to ! i made a reservation for a party of N and when i got here i was told that the restaurant had tried to call me to confirm the reservation , and since they had not been able to get a hold of me , they just cancelled it ( ? ) . i was only given the option of waiting for another table that would open up N minutes after my original reservation time . what the heck ? if you call a restaurant to make a reservation , then it is expected that they actually reserve a table for the time you make a reservation ? 
awesome brunch ! have been for brunch a few times , its great ! waiters are so nice and attentive , food is great , fun atmosphere . will go again and again . it is always packed which is a good sign . 
a diner by another name , with extremely authentic , extremely affordable and extremely simple puerto rican fare - done right . menu changes daily and if you ask nicely they ' re good about substitutions of sides , etc
i have to say , i only write reviews on yelp if something is terrible or amazing . spuntino to me , is amazing . i love the atmosphere . although there is a large dining area , it doesn ' t feel like a cafeteria . i was hesitant at first about the idea of italian tapas as it ' s hard to get italian food to taste authentic . this executive chef does it right . love , love , love the gorgonzola bruschetta , the mushroom risotto and the shrimp scampi . any dessert you choose is unreal . they have special gelato that they make and the chocolate mint is the best one . their service is very good and the great thing about this place is that you can order so many things and feel like you ' re spending a ton of money because of the amount of food you eat but the bill is so reasonable . i highly recommend spuntino . i don ' t live in nj but i come here to visit friends . we have gone to spuntino the past three times i ' ve visited because we crave some of the food there . 
great za . 
do not eat here ! ! ! ! horrible service ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the manager yelled at me as we were leaving ! first he pestered us multiple times to leave because he wanted to seat other people at our table ( i ' m sorry , is this a french restaurant ? ) , mind you , it ' s late on thursday night , there are N other tables open ( yes , i counted them ) . we said , " that ' s fine , can we have the check . " he then came back numerous times because he didn ' t think we were paying fast enough ! then as we were leaving he pulled me and a friend aside and demanded to know what i had said to my waitress ! he said , " if you have something to say , say it to me , i ' m the manager ! " i answered him , " i told her the tip was strictly for her , because you were rude " he then proceeds to scream at me in front of all his other customers , calling me rude and finally culminates in him yelling , " good riddance ! ! ! " at me as i am trying to get the door open and get away from this giant buffoon . needless to say , horrible experience and i would never recommend it . the pity too is that i was with a moma curator and we had been thinking about planning an after party at this restaurant . thankfully we were saved from any future embarrassment ! i can only imagine this giant asshole screaming at my poor mother , " drink your coffee faster ! ! " 
food was alright , their rice dishes don ' t have a lot of vegetable choices , other than that , can ' t complain . service is okay , they ' re very curt , and i can ' t even say it ' s due to a language barrier because i speak mandarin . it ' s a small place so i don ' t recommend big groups . 
i . love . cantina . i started coming here over N years ago when i was waitressing at a well know " opera " cafe in s . philly . we ' d come by after work for drinks and food . i love the atmosphere and the welcoming and extremely cool servers and bar tenders . their food is phenomenal - as is the fair at their dos segundos location , too . you can sit inside or outside , great margaritas ! ! ! when people ask me where to go for food and drinks in s . philly , i tell them cantina . by far my favorite in the city . 
amazing . obvi . best bloody mary in the city , and second best brunch ( sabrina ' s . . . . ) . as a g-ho resident , i get a little cranky about the outsiders driving over for weekend brunch and taking up the street parking . thanks for making me feel like a sour urban grandma , outsiders . 
my husband and i dined here last night . as always with a garces restaurant , the service was very good . the pecan " snack " was incredible . i enjoyed the tuna appetizer along with the crab gratin . my husband loved the iron chef pork ribs and the pumpkin croquettes . the redecorating of the space has softened the it as much as possible . the open kitchen was incredibly calm on what appeared to be a very busy sat night . 
went here for dinner with friends on a weeknight . very relaxed atmosphere and overall chill place . food was fantastic - super fresh veggies and salads and delicious ! they go a little heavy with the deep frying , but otherwise good . menu changes daily , so they tell you when you sit down , but don ' t mention the prices . my only gripe don ' t mind the changing menu , but would be nice if they put the menu on a dry-erase board or chalk board and wrote the prices down . 
best pizza i have ever had . so glad i live right around the corner . i will definitely be frequenting this place often--especially after it gets a liquor license . 
love this place ! ! ! who can beat the pre-fixe menu with appetizer and entree for only N . i had a delicious salad and fish entree . . . . was so yummy ! ! ! i couldn ' t get enough of this food , everything was simply delicious and so reasonably priced . the service was good too , they were very attentive and polite . overall i had a nice experience and would definitely recommend this tastefully decorated restaurant . just remember to bring cash , since they don ' t accept cards . 
simply put , if you like cambodian food ( and who doesn ' t ? ! ) this is the place to try . they have a wide variety of sandwiches which aren ' t outrageous in price and they ' re all really fresh tasting . the tiger shrimp sandwich is my favorite but my friend swears by the pork belly . check it out ! ! 
my family has bin going there ten years we love that place did not diver our oder and would not give a discount the boss said we don ' t give discount we have no oder and hung up the phone dont go there ever bad customer service
no idea why i took so long to warm to the idea of the N fixed price three course fabulous lunch brunch thing . everything was lovely , came around N Npm on saturday and had a lovely corner booth seat . had a clean and lovely arctic char sashimi followed by the housemade gravlax and things were just perfect perfect perfect . i will be back for sure . 
be prepared to wait a long time if you want to eat here . now that your body is ready , this place is a delightful brunch place . service is good , but busy . they take your phone number and will text you when your table is coming up ( best thing ever ) . i got the salmon benedict and it was delicious . coffee was good , and comes with orange juice . my friend just kept on getting her bellini refilled ( yay ? ) overall a great place for brunch . all the entries looked delicious ( except oatmeal eww ) . i would definitely come here again on a lazy weekend brunch . 
worse place in the city . food was bad . rather go to burger king or mcdonald than this slop house . 
two words avacado toast . 
i ' ve read both good and not so good reviews about this restaurant so i made it a mission to try it for myself ! i ' m a huge seafood lover and love cajun creole food , especially seafood boils . i went way out of the way to find this place and i was not disappointed ! it was so good that i had it N days in a row and i was only in ny for N days . i ordered the " boil special spicy " with crawfish , snow crab legs and clams . omg just writing this review is making me drool ! it delivered on all aspects . it was fatty buttery spicy goodness ! ! don ' t bother asking the locals where to find this place cuz no one seems to know that this restaurant even exists . . . not even the cops ! if you do find this place it kinda looks like it doesn ' t belong there . inside is a very cool vibe . dim lighting with limited seats . there were only a couple of quoms i had with this place . . . N is that they only take cash but they don ' t tell you on the phone when you place a take out order and N is that the prices on the their website ( or lack there of ) does not match what you actually pay - i think its been a long while since someone updated that site . all in all you have to try this place if you are a seafood lover ! 
i went back to mcladden ' s to see if my first good experience could be repeated . this is a fun place and has a great atmosphere . i ' ve read lots of the positive and less than positive reviews . i can understand the criticisms but i think those writers are unrealistic . this is a place that is really trying . the staff are all smiling and helpful and look pretty busy . the beer selection is great and the food is good . the french onion soup is delicious and the sandwiches were really good . ( once i had fish and chips that i wasn ' t crazy about - too soggy ) the personality of a restaurant is important for me - even more than the food . ( the kitchen is the lowest point in this pub . ) this feels like an irish pub where families , singles , and couples are all welcome and comfortable . whenever i am in the area , i am going to go here . 
the worst place to be in nyc . . . . the the guys ( or girls ) working at the door as host ( hostess ? ) had the biggest attitude i ' ve ever seen . . . they were dancing like to cranes on meth and have no respect at all with the customers . . . . . 
my boyfriend took me to kefi for my birthday so our expectations were high and we wanted to share a nice romantic meal . in terms of atmosphere and service i would only give kefi N-stars , below average . we got seated at a table with no privacy , in fact the table next to me had to get moved out just so that i could slide into my seat . the table itself was about N inches wide and N-N feet long for N people to dine , with about N inches on either side of us between tables . i don ' t think we could have even put more than one appetizer and our eating plates on the table . i understand that a restaurant is a business but this was absurd , there was no point talking to my boyfriend because we had the buzz of the conversations happening on either side of us directly in our ears . so we politely got up , or rather not so politely , because we had to make the people next to us get up and move their table out for the Nnd time , and went to the host stand and asked for a corner table . table N , a small but semi-private corner table . we waited about N minutes at the bar to be seated at our new table and from their we enjoyed a delicious and reasonably priced meal ( people do come here in masses for some reason after all ) . a few other no-no ' s our wine came out after a few of our dishes had been brought out and we had to remind our server . also , getting refills of water is no easy task . we order the grilled octopus , hanger steak , spread platter , sheepskin dumplings , and meatballs - all of it was very good in my opinion and well portioned . i rated kefi N star ' s because i enjoyed the food and the prices were fair . i would never go back to this place for a birthday , anniversary , etc . . . in fact , i think the best thing is to make reservations in advance for tables of N in the downstairs back room where you can get a larger table and a little bit more space . N person parties seem to get shoved wherever you can fit them . 
terrible service , and they changed the menu , which is now a shell of it ' s former self . what a shame , this place used to be great . 
even though they rush you in and out and seating is cramped , i ' ll look past these complaints and still give empanada mama N stars . why ? b c the food is that good . sure it ' s not haute cuisine but it ' s still damn good . the spicy chicken empanada and the cuban empanada are not to be missed . also , the fried yuca is tasty . i think N empanadas is probably the right amount . 
cute little east village spot with tasty food and friendly waitstaff . the pricing is very reasonable , and its the perfect little place to sit outside under the awning when it is raining . 
i ' ve been repeatedly disappointed by their everything . i will say there place is beautiful and very big . however they should spend more time on their food . the apple has fallen far from the tree with regard to their newark location . having multiple locations was a big mistake . the cakes tasted old and stale , pastries soggy . the bread was even mediocre . i thought they bake constantly ? i guess not . i much prefer sorrento bakery in east hanover . even if you like calandras , you will love sorrento . 
in my opinion this is the best cheesesteak out there period . i ' ve had cheesesteaks from all over the place and this is still the best ! 
i frequently eat lunch at mercato tomato pie and i love it ! ! ! the service is always great and the pizza is the best i have tasted in a while ! ! ! 
i don ' t tend to like upscale versions of poor mans food . cuban food is generally tasty and cheap . but i gotta say , the food was delicious , it had lovely ambience , and some great latin tunes played all night as our sangria flowed . our table ordered a lot of food and it was all delicious . most notably , the chilean sea bass special was to die for . 
amore ! amore ! what more can i say ? da marcella is a neighborhood italian place that one is apt to pass by ( as i have done many times ) . when i perused their menu , however , i knew i had to try it . coming out to reunite with a friend from my times in the eternal city , i found the place had that quintessential italian charm that entranced me two years ago . the intimate space has plenty of italian cum western movie posters from yesteryear hanging on the walls , black and white film classics playing on the screen by the bar , and communal bar tables flanking each side . the waiters , with their bon vivant attitude and neopolitan accents , really add to the authenticity of that palpable energy . enjoying this convivial environment , i figured i ' d likewise enjoy a bountiful meal with my glass of nero d ' avola . i decided to be adventurous by going with that night ' s special of tripe stew ! some would be disgusted , or even dry heave , at the mention of a stew consisting of stomach , chorizo , and blood sausage i salivated at the thought . this bowl might have been one of the most delicious plates of food i have had in my existence . there ' s no way to really explicate just how rich and amazing it was leave your gastronomic inhibitions behind and trust me on this one . it was one tough act to follow , but the pappardelle alla fiorentina fared pretty well with its thick and decadent pink-cognac sauce and smoked pancetta . equally rich , i think i might have overindulged that night . my stomach may have been bemoaning my sinful act of gluttony , but my soul was thoroughly pleased ( regardless of it ' s placement post-mortem ) . 
great food and drinks , and very nice ambiance - especially in warmer weather when you can sit outside
found this place totally by accident on our last trip to nyc . great drinks and food at a fair price for new york . the real treat of the visit was the partner of the owner who happened to be holding court at the end of the bar and greeted us as family we must have looked lost - ) they even have a pretty good oregon wine , so we felt at home . even if your not staying in the village , this place is worth the ride . 
just came back from a business meeting and needed a quick spot before heading on train . we stopped at empanada mama for a quick bite , and i tell you i was so impressed for this speedy spot - right up the path from busy katz ' s deli . the service was impeccable ! the set of plates and utensils set up for the small spot was a nice touch- if it were only bigger ! the plaintains servings were huge and the guacamole off the chain ! ! i had the brasil empanada , strong taste but nicely seasoned and fresh . my friend had the vegetarian empanada and she enjoyed the blend of flavors as well . very very nice and i will be back ! it ' s been in business for a month , so hopefully the service and quality doesn ' t change , as it ' s been known to happen for most ny spots . 
i ' ve been here a bunch of times since i went to drexel . their food is decent with a nice selection of pizza , panins , wraps , brunch items , etc . it is standard american italian food . i wouldn ' t rave about . the prices are decent . fortunately they ' re open til Nam or something awesome like that so go get your drunchies on people . 
we stopped here for after dinner drinks . i wanted a good pretzel and this place delivered ! the sauce was good , the beer was good , the service was good . if i lived in philly this place would be a regular spot . 
happened upon this cozy place happily while strolling the east village in search of a nice brunch spot . loved the sparkle of the chandeliers , decorative tin ceiling and the warm wood and brick textures . we slipped into a bench booth against the wall overlooking the elegant bar . sedate , local , but happening . we spied dishes had by other guests . . . the white bean dip with spiced pita chips looked spectacular . we started with the shitake mushroom tart with black truffel oil . . . amazing ! followed by the sauteed shrimp over grits ( i love buttery grits ! ) with a side of chicken fennel sausage , and " the francisco " a combination of scrambled eggs , squash , sundried tomatoes and basil with a side of sausage or bacon . unbelievable flavors ! topped with cold refreshing wine goblets of mimosas . we were so elated by our discovery , we called a couple of friends to join us on the spot . service , food , and atmosphere . . . . wonderful . 
came in for a quick brunch , got the burger with fried egg and was very happy with the entire meal . the food came out hot and everything teased fresh . my fianc got the breakfast burrito and loved it also . 
el rey has great happy hour specials . their N tacos are fresh , flavorful and come in a variety of choices , like fish , chicken , steak . . . i personally love the fish tacos , and their happy hour menu includes rotating appetizers in the N- N range . add a N margarita , and this makes it the perfect happy hour spot . 
one of the worst dining experiences i ' ve ever had . i ' m actually a very rational , reasonable person . there have been times , like anyone , when i ' ve had a disappointing meal . while i often intend to write a post about such a lackluster meal , i often forgive and forget and give an establishment the benefit of the doubt . for this experience , i feel like people need to be candidly forewarned . we had a reservation for two for N N but were kept waiting for N minutes . for couples who came in after us , the wait time ( likewise , with a reservation ) increased to an hour . everyone was kept waiting like cattle in a cramped area . all the while , the vapid glamazon host kept his back to everyone and simply threw up his hands whenever anyone would question the unreasonable wait . when we were finally seated , the host barely said a word never mind an apology . we had to wait another N minutes for a waitress to come over and open our wine and offer water . although it was only N N , they had run out of N of N entrees . they simply offered to make both dishes without the key ingredient ( lobster ) . on this night , they had a four course prix fixe menu . the first course didn ' t come out for half an hour . both selections ( risotto and a salad ) were very standard fare . the next course took approximately N minutes a salty mahi dish in some kind of frothy sauce that looked like spittle . our wait for our entrees was again over N minutes at this point , we had been there N hours and N minutes amidst inattentive and apathetic waitstaff who acted as though nothing was amiss . ( in the meantime , we watched N different couples leave one was an aforementioned couple with a reservation who were told they had an hour wait another who were seated at a dingy table virtually in a hallway leading to a kitchen and a third who simply got sick of the absurd wait . ) oh , and to top it off , there was a table for four sitting empty for N hour and N minutes while people who had reservations were pretty much told to deal with an hour wait . inexcusable . disgraceful . with all the great options in montclair , why would anyone subject themselves to this incompetence and ridiculousness ? 
i ' m actually inspired to write this review . this place rates a very strong experience on the restaurant scale . the food is superb . value is ridiculous . no need to pay and wait for locanda verde or gradisca . much ( ! ) better than malatesta . shrimp tomato risotto blew me away . my friend took a bite and did a freeze frame with her eyes shockingly widened . it has a depth of flavor that sticks to your palette . not sure how they did the stock but it hits your umami tastebud . like the kind of rich bone marrow beef broth that burrows into your tongue - but seafood style . the octopus salad was divine . it was different because the octopus was amazingly soft and sweet . they must have marinated it in a softening agent . that or they massaged it for N hours like N star michelin sushi chef jiro . the assortment of sauces was light but very flavorful . i am the type who would not miss wine if i never had another sip . i do not crave wine . however , my wine was absolutely delicious . the cannoneau . the nose is spectacular . i think it has grenache because it had the sophisticated perfume cologne smell that french blends have . i was afraid it would overpower like a merlot but it was a hybrid between a pinot noir and cabernet . perfection . a glass is N but would run you N in tribeca . the waiter automatically pours everyone a bump to try first . my friend had a great white wine . big sauvignon blanc fan . service is efficient , prompt , and lightning fast . i think it ' s one waiter and bartender duo . think casino dealer efficiency with a french accent . how they cook such wonderful food in that tiny little kitchen is unbeknownst to me . 
my favorite cheese steak place in philadelphia . real cheese instead of cheesewiz . dalessandro ' s is not stingy with their meat . there is plenty of meat inside the bread so it ' s not primarily bread . they take the time to melt the cheese on the meat instead of slapping slices of cheese on the bread and then meat on top . the meat is well cooked . and you can ask for toppings on top . you will get a healthy cheese steak just the way you like it . no matter how busy it gets , they are pretty quick with their service . 
the service is welcoming and speedy . the broth was delicately flavored with the miso peeking through . there ' s no denying that they use quality ingredients . ( to be honest i would ' ve preferred more miso , and thicker noodles ) . the braised pork i ordered as an extra was an unneeded distracted . that being said , this is a solid choice and hopefully will relieve some pressure from totto . 
just got home from my first meal at this brand new restaurant in west hartford ' s blue back square . tonight was it ' s official opening night so when the waiter announcing the N fresh pasta maker was broken came as a bit of a surprise . upon walking in , first impressions are impressive . a large , open space mixing metropolitan high ceilings and decor with tuscan warmth and rustic details . they also presented us immediately with complimentary wine and cheese meat tasting . very smart way to educate the customer to the italian only wine list and the overall traditional rustic cuisine concept of the restaurant . we did book a reservation , so waiting for a table was annoying , however the tasting was a distraction . after not super long we were walked to our table which was in the back room section of the restaurant . the decor felt more forced than the rest of the place . like it was an afterthought kind of room with a wine rack on one side , very tall ( drafty ) windows on the other and a photo mural of wine barrels covering the back wall . it felt a bit " chain " style . like a panera or something . ( ok not quite that bad ) on to the food . they brought bland room temperature bread to the table with a lovely herbed olive oil to dip it in . we were a table of N so the dipping bowl was awkward to deal with . we ended up each messily pouring the oil onto our bread plates . peppered and salted it was a decent starter , although as a whole the presentation was lackluster . tuscan bread should be an experience ! this felt like not a lot of care was put into it . there was more care in the folding of the napkin cradling the bread than the bread itself . and they need a better system for the oil . the quality of the olive oil is fantastic . amazing texture and lightness . but the added herbs did not make much of a flavor statement . salad greens were enjoyed by all , except the orange and fennel salad had a culinary school vibe . like the cook just discovered fennel and will treat everyone else like they have never tasted it . very amateurish . the quality of ingredients again was very high however . a friend said the salted cod mashed potatoes were fantastic , although not something he couldn ' t easily make at home . the entrees were eh on all accounts . it sucks when you don ' t feel like finishing your meal . i had the organic salmon with asparagus and farro . sounded simple to me ! again , quality was fantastic . the salmon was everything it should have been . the farro and asparagus obviously good quality but the combination of flavors missed the mark . was it too buttery ? i don ' t even know , it just wasn ' t awesome , and for N it should have been . also there were only a few slivers of asparagus . i ' m saying , load it up ! here ' s the overview pros nice decor friendly service good manager fresh ingredients simple menu cons untrained waitstaff ( non existent wine service ) mediocre food presentation over thought flavors to seemingly simple dishes borderline corporate ambiance bottom line if you ' re looking for amazing and creative italian , stick to bricco . if you have to take the suits out to a business dinner and they wont know the difference , it ' s perfect . if you love fresh ingredients and a metropolitan meets rustic farm fresh feel , check out firebox in hartford . much better food for you buck . hey it ' s brand new place so give it some time to warm up . maybe they can warm up their bread while they ' re at it . 
one of my favorite places to eat ramen . the only bad thing is a bad memory of my ex and it being his favorite places as well . ippudo . . you should make another location . ) maybe i may visit you more . the wait is kind of long as well . . . but worth it when the food is in my tummy ! the pork buns and the fried hot peppers are my favorite ! 
food - i was really looking forward to visiting pat ' s steaks for a really long time and finally had the time to come around to trying . but boyyy was i wrong and will never return again . the bread wasn ' t anything great , the meat was dry and overall the sandwich was dry . the only thing saving it was the condiments . however i do have to admit that the jalapeno was delicious - not what i even came there for though . price - honestly , i felt like i didn ' t get what i paid for . the portions weren ' t all that big and it didn ' t even taste great . service - the utmost worst service i have ever received . the lady at the window started with a stare that almost felt like she was staring down my soul and then proceed to have the most horrible attitude ever when asking us what we wanted our philly cheese steak . this is the main reason why this spot does not deserve anything more than a N star . not going to return ! 
it ' s a cold wintry day , they wind bites through your coat and all you can think of is warm , comforting relief . that ' s minca . i ' m sold on the ramen here . i love that you can taste the flavourful broth as opposed to salt . the herr noodles are great ! i ' d gladly cab it to minca from anywhere in the city . 
although i love the soup , i have to say that their business practices have turned me off for good . the server charged me twice ( once before tip , once after ) and i contacted them immediately for a refund of the pre-tip amount . the manager said it happens ( as i ' m sure it does everywhere ) , and they would have the bank revert the charge . two weeks later , i followed up because nothing had happened . several days later , the manager returned my call , acting very condescending and said they " don ' t give away free food . " i offered to bring my statement , but the manager said i needed to have the bank provide a slip with an invoice for both , which of course does not exist because they don ' t issue invoices for sales , they just process sales . not worth the trouble of N lunch buffet , but left a terrible taste in my mouth . 
went with N friends a few weeks ago . the staff was really friendly . they were a bit short-handed so the owners were waiting tables . they seemed a bit overwhelmed by it but it was charming . great location and excellent food . not fussy at all . great option for brunch in new haven when you ' re not in the mood to wait in line at the pantry or the like . 
a totally yummy experience with regard to food and ambiance . on my last visit , we came to get brunch . i know they have a set brunch time , we showed up a little after that . had a nice little appropriate-for-breakfast cocktail , tasty and refilled by the waitress as soon as she saw we were getting low . the crepes themselves were delicious . neither i nor my companion ordered from their menu of set crepes , although some looked good , i had one with goat cheese and greens and mushrooms which i thoroughly enjoyed . when we ordered , the waitress asked if we would like bacon for the table . bacon for the table ! what a brilliant idea ! so simple , so impossible to resist . of course we got some , crispy and salty bacony perfection . we split a sweet crepe for dessert , one something chocolaty and fruity with chestnut cream . we couldn ' t taste the chestnut cream at all , unfortunately , but this is completely forgivable . i finished my meal with some of the best espresso in philly . i am very picky about this . believe me when i say it was great . on past visits , i have enjoyed other crepes , wine , and their cheese and fruit plate , which has a collection of completely approachable and delicious cheeses . always a good experience . 
great sandwiches , fun salads , nice staff . it ' s about all i can say about this awesome little sandwich shop . several months ago , my boss bought the office lunch and i was to pick where to get it . i chose this place and the entire office are now chronic patrons . couldn ' t ask for a better quick lunch spot for the area - ) 
there sandwiches are very good , you really get your money worth . the service is fast and professional . just writing this makes me want a sandwich ! 
finally made it to this place and i will say that all the previous reviews are on the money as far as their ramen soups go . i had the special wasabi ramen soup . . . . it was incredible . . . my wife had the miso one and she loved it as well . i do have a couple of small negative things to say . . . for one the waiter was nice but a bit pushy . when we ordered two ramen soups because my daughter is only N and would share one with me or my wife , he kept insisting that we order one for her as well . now these are big portions and there is no way a small child could finish the whole thing . this bothered me a little . now from reading some of the other reviews . . . i ordered the pork steak in ginger sausce . i ofcourse asked the waiter what he thought and ofcourse i got the usual answer that it was his favorite . . ( for once i wish i could get an honest answer from a waiter . . . but will keep trying . . . lol ) . i must say i will never order that dish again . . . the pork had no taste and very fatty . we also ordered the the tuna and the buns . . . the buns are excellent . . the tuna was very good . as far as my rating goes . . . the ramen soups get N stars . . . but the place is very pricey . . . for two soups and three appetizers the bill was over N dollars . if you are in the mood for excellent soup this place rocks . . . if you order other things prepare to pay up . 
to say that this place has " long lines " is an understatement . if i were serious and actually time it , i ' d probably clock it at around a N-N-N minute wait , depending on the time of the night . but in reality , if i ' m here , it ' s probably N N Nam on a friday or saturday , with a bunch of half-drunk friends , and am not sober enough to notice that we ' ve been standing in the same line for the past hour , shivering in N degree weather . i don ' t understand this cart . there are carts at every street intersection selling the exact same thing , but whatever is in the white sauce ( which hopefully is legal ) has the whole city flocking over at ungodly times of the night . and what ' s more , i don ' t even eat meat . i just have them fill it up with rice , veggies , and whatever else they want - just give me some of that sauce ! ! 
great " good food " 
very disappointed with the drop in quality . three or four slices of meat on a grinder is ridiculous . all you can taste is bread . i bought my last grinder from there today . definitely not worth the price ! 
the wraps are pretty huge . a half wrap and fries should fill you up unless you are really really hungry . the fries are good , but i think it is the dipping sauce selection that makes it . . . . . although it is really hard to pick just one . they also have banana pudding ! 
turn around . there are N better diners ( topped diner and lyndhurst diner ) only N min drives away on the same road ! if you like food that sucks , eat here . 
yummy all around ! ! had the gyoza- not too doughy , a guacamole , cilantro , tuna roll , and the bbq short ribs as appetizer ! so goooood . then noodles as an entree . they were great with the pork belly , the broth is delicious . 
rating reflects that this location is a consistently above average bertucci ' s . this has been confirmed after being subjected to a few other bertucci ' s locations in nj and elsewhere over the years . as with any chain restaurant , more sophisticated entrees are hit or miss and the assumption is that you may be better off at your local neighborhood italian joint for that kind of meal . that said , we stick to the consistently good brick oven pizza ( portofino or the bella napoli ) , pannini , and salads . plus they have stella on tap . good for a group that includes kids and good for a quick bite before or after the movies ( N yards from regal cinemas ) . 
if you ' ve ever eaten portuguese food in a restaurant setting , you know you ' re gonna get a ridiculous amount of food . i underestimated this place when i ordered them for delivery one night . i ordered a full size boneless chicken in garlic sauce with red beans and rice thinking that i would get a big plate of food , nothing more . boy was i wrong . the driver showed up with a super heavy , super full aluminum container ( like the ones at cookouts ! ) ! i was amazed on sheer portion size alone . i ended up having leftovers for dayyyyyyyyyyyyysss . the taste is impeccable as well . the garlic sauce was so extremely buttery and delightful i wanted to get a big tub of it and sprinkle it over everything i eat for the rest of my life , kinda like reverse sensa . the rice was cooked to perfection and my chicken was juicy enough to collect the sauce but tough enough to make samira chew like big man . man oh man . my beans were yummy too . i had a similar experience when i ate at the actual restaurant about a week later . i was smarter this time and ordered the half-size portion , and even that i still had to take some home . prices here are very fair , especially considering the amount of food they ' re giving to you . the restaurant is cute and has a slight pizzeria feel , and it ' s also byob . very solid spot for authentic portuguese in spanktown . 
decided to pick up a sub on the way home from work tonight . one slice of meat and one slice of cheese . pathetic
love this place any time i want thai food in nyc ! their pad thai is the best around ! love the decor and atmosphere - very swanky but the food comes out wait too quickly that it feels like they are in a rush to get us the hell out of there . 
i had lunch there today very pleasant staff the waiter mike was great super friendly and great service ! food was good and there wasn ' t a long wait after we ordered . party of N we ate outside nice ambiance loved it ! 
had a terrible experience there with an african american worker tonika she was very rude , rolled here eyes and muttered fowl language i will never eat there again
and how long would you wait for noodles ? i whined . i like this place , but i am not completely head-over-heels in love . deciding on what star rating this place should get has precipitated lots of conflicted emotions inside of me because of all these new ramen places popping up left and right , all over the east village area . . . oh i love them all ! how to start comparing what to what ? is this what i deserve for being ramen-polyamorous ? so this place is a little bit more expensive than most of the ramen places in the area , excluding momofuku noodle bar . places that fall under the cheaper price range would be places like ramen setagaya , rai rai ken , may chan ramen and robatayaki , menkui tei , kambi ramen . . . you get the idea . so my logical expectation of ippudo would be that they have to have better ramen than them . they don ' t disappoint . their noodles are freshly made and there is a large variety of ramen to choose from . once seated , the ambiance is bustling , but very relaxing , which stems from the beautiful and unique japanese art pieces . and the service was very friendly and helpful . i like that the staff cheerfully greet the customers as they are getting seated . i try to come here before N N to avoid the long wait list , which can be anywhere from N minutes to N hours long . being the very impatient person that i am , i get frustrated when i have to wait more than an hour in order to get seated . i sit and pout and quietly complain , saying things like , " i mean , it better be the best place in the world to get such a long wait . . . and even the best places in the world don ' t necessarily get long waits ! there are no ' lines , ' in michigan , where i come from . " the bar does help alleviate some restless customers , which is nice because then you can complain while drinking . however , the front waiting area can get very crowded , loud , and unpleasantly uncomfortable . with this being said , i strongly feel that this place cannot get a five-star rating . they get good business , and i just feel that they can afford to get more seating or a larger space . but this space seating issue is ippudo ' s only major flaw . when i went here last , i got a wonderful bowl of ebi wonton ramen , which was just another example as to how ippudo makes great ramen with quality ingredients . i have also sampled the pork belly bits from the akamaru modern , which is very rich and tasty ( and different from momofuku ' s ramen pork belly ) . when venturing to the bathroom downstairs , i also noticed that they have their own noodle making room ( see pictures ) which you can see by peering into a very narrow and long set of windows in the hallway . the noodle making guy didn ' t seem to be in today , but you can sometimes spot him cheerfully drawing long strands of dough from a machine . there is no question that every ingredient is freshly made on premises , down to each strand of noodle . ippudo has their own style in their decor as well as in their cuisine . i love them for that . 
i came here on a friend ' s recommendation and i am glad we made the trip . true the wait is long and they only take cash but the pizza was delicious . we shared the lombardi ' s original and subsequently inhaled it . my friend raved about the dough and said it was one of the best he ' d ever had . 
average skirt steak and steak frites . the belgian fries were like any other fries , really . i liked the waffle dessert , but who doesn ' t like dessert that comes with ice cream and chocolate syrup on top ? the venue itself is a cute , narrow and long pathway with a dimly lit back room . there ' s little coat hooks everywhere and frosted windows to make the place seem more like home . 
hit this place for dinner last year when i was in town , and was looking forward to a return visit . the food is great and made with care . highlights include the orange salad , potatoes and empanadas . the only catch is that the place is super small , so it ' s tough to accommodate large groups ( meaning anything more than four people ) . 
a modernized indian place just off lex in curry hill . have been twice , and it ' s very solid northern indian with a few dishes i ' d never seen . standards ( chicken tikka , saag , chana ) all excellent , and they are not afraid of the chillies . nice enough for a date , too , which is honestly not always the case with cheaper places . . . 
i gave saint austere a Nnd chance after my Nst ' meh ' experience there , simply because fabrizio was so sweet the first time we were there , when we stopped in after a performance . he gave us some extra dishes with substitutions for my veggie needs , including N killer one ( polenta ) and encouraged us to give it another try , since we live in the neighbourhood . ooooooooffff - the man tricked me . returning was a bad move because this time , i didn ' t have the pleasure of his company to save the day . instead , i was with his less than charming sister , who would do better as a paralegal than a bartender server . hospitality is clearly not a family trait . deplorable disgusting ! ! there should be a star for that . as for the food the same bland bummer from the kitchen with a braised short ribs risotto ( N ) served in a bowl smaller than my cat ' s of course in square cubes that reminded me of beef dishes in india with a little cold temperature for effect . beet pasta was super boring harder than gnocchi supposed to filled with what they called cheese . to down this sad cuisine - we needed wine which came from a list selected by someone behind the delivery counter in a diner . the wine list the same unfortunate selection with only N mediocre italian reds by the glass . oy ! clearly , the smart thing to do for any customer at this point is to end this misery . but the kicker came when i asked for the bill , and the paralegal asked " what was wrong with the meal " . i started to answer , and she threw me out of the restaurant . yes , you read that right . the woman asked me to tell her what i didn ' t like , then said " i ' m going to have to ask you to leave now . " unreal . why ask if you don ' t want to know ? i didn ' t say a word until asked for my feedback which of course would ooze out of me after this killer experience at the bar - right ? fabrizio shows up just to hand the credit card that we left at the counter says " thank you " - my postscript to the paralegal don ' t fret , darling - i won ' t be back ensure no one from my neighborhood does either . my recommendation grand street has other options to offer if you need a paralegal there is one right round the corner . 
i cannot describe how upsetting my dining experience was after eating here . but , i ' ll do my best . now , i understand why poco , right across the street , was packed with people waiting outside , while this place was nearly empty on a sunday afternoon during labor day weekend . i will never come here again . it ' s a shame because there were some other desserts on their menu that i would have liked to try . i cannot fathom how a restaurant can provide such mediocre and slow service . there were a number of incidents that bothered me during my visit N ) it took N minutes after closing our menus before i had to flag down a waitress to come and take our table ' s order . N ) the guacamole and chips ( N ) came , but our entrees never made it to the table until , after a really long time before my friend and i realized that our food wasn ' t going to get to the table on its own , without us having to flag down a manager this time . we ordered a chicken salad ( the salad was N and adding chicken is N ) and a huevos rancheros . how long does it take to put together a salad and eggs with sauce ? apparently , it takes this restaurant N minutes . that ' s ridiculous . N ) my salad was served , and i realized the chicken was missing . i caught sight of the manager , and he had been carrying over a plate of sliced grilled chicken . he had been very apologetic for the management ' s shortcomings thus far . N ) dessert time we ordered a N tres leches . delicious . not too sweet . i also wanted to order the banana pudding , but my friend and i were too full . my friend also ordered a coffee with our dessert . halfway into our tres leches , her coffee was still nowhere to be found . final flag down with the manager . " please cancel our coffee order . we ' re done with dessert . " apparently , they serve an avocado cake during evening service . unfortunately , i won ' t be coming here to try it . had the manager not comped our dessert , i would have deducted a star . 
i have tried plenty of indian food in philly but karma is definitely the best . i suggest the samosas as an appetizer and the chicken tikka masala as a main dish ! the staff is friendly and the food is delicious ! 
we stop at this place to have a bite on our way to a john meyer concert in camden we decided to go with the goat cheese over figs for an app as it was totally disappointing we couldn ' t even finish a total of four pieces then we decided with the octopus ( two legs ) for N which tasted boiled with olive oil and vinegar the best dish was a bbq bronzino for N i could have bought it myself for N and put in on the bbq not worth the money and there wine list was weak we order a bottle of pinot which was a twist of top lol
possibly the best place to eat lobster south of providence . their lobster mac cheese is sublime . expect a long wait at any night . but it ' s worth it . despite the huge crowd inside the staff stayed cool warm . 
i start by saying the food we ate was very good . however , our overall experience was lacking to say the least . i went to eataly with a small group of friends last weekend . we planned to have wine and snack downstairs and then proceed to the rooftop for dinner . we had wine and cheese meat platters downstairs to the tune of N . the food and wine was good . we proceeded to the greeter to take the elevator upstairs . the " greeter " was less than friendly to say the least . we finally got upstairs and were informed we would need to wait N minutes for a table ( we had a reservation by the way for the time we arrived ) . we went to the bar and spent another N on wine for our group . when we got to the table and started to order dinner a couple of people only wanted a salad and were planning to also get dessert . our server promptly informed us we had to leave . what ? we were impolitely told everyone was required to order an entr e or we would need to leave . yet again , what ? she finally told us we had ordered enough food to stay . nice ! thank you for making us feel so welcome . the food was fine , but it couldn ' t get rid of the bad taste of being treated so poorly . when we finished dinner our server threw our check on the table and stomped off . needless to say we promptly paid and left . ( we had dessert at a lovely little place down the street . wow , i think they were happy we were there just to have cake and coffee . ) after dropping over N at eataly and leaving feeling unwelcome i ' ll never go back . it ' s obvious the owners think a little too highly of themselves . they need to remember they are in a service industry . 
this is the best sushi i have had in central nj . everything is very fresh and presented very well . even the salad with ginger dressing is amazing . highly recommended the volcano roll and the black ninja roll and the steamed shumai . they are also very open to suggestions - they even added ginger ice cream . biggest problem they are hidden away off the beaten path in the middle of a residential area off cozzens lane . 
i signed up for yelp just to write a review for them . i live on Nth and eat here frequently . i love this place from the environment , the staff who are lovely , and the food . 
best burger in town . small space but worth the wait . 
zio ' s is a good option for the workweek , but it isn ' t the best i ' ve had . their slices are admittedly huge , but the dough is really thick . i prefer a thinner and crispier crust like the place in my neighborhood but i can ' t complain when this is where my office orders from . i usually just cut off the crust and throw it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp it up . the place itself is very clean and they always have a good selection . i like their veggie pizza a lot and although heavy , tastes very fresh . i have also tried their greek salad and it is decent . pretty standard iceberg tomato olives but they pack on these big chunks of feta cheese and its delicious . 
excellent ! great food especially the fried oysters and duck breast . the menu is truly " without borders " as the website says . the atmosphere is beautiful and romantic , very open and simple with clean lines that go along with the well executed food . don ' t take a group , it is more of a date place . extensive wine list but we tried the cocktails and they were also very good . oh and you have to try the desert of N sorbets , the coconut and chocolate is amazing ! 
i ' m so glad the cavs crew took over this place . the dark horse was going to hell and it badly needed some fun ! great new food menu and happy hour is awesome . love playing darts and catching a monday night game here occasionally . 
as a huge fan of these guys first spot manhattan proper in tribeca i decided i had to come check out proper west their new location and i was not disappointed ! their downtown spot will always be my home as a fidi resident . but i will be sure to make it back whenever i find myself in midtown ! 
this restaurant remains one of the reasons why i love philly . delicious , wholesome , cheap eats . if you planted nan zhou hand drawn noodle house in another big city like dc , you ' d find exorbitant prices . but in the city of brotherly love , you can find your belly bulging out for less than N on a large bowl of noodle soup . lanzhou lamian , or pulled noodle , has so much history . in the old noodle house in philly , you could watch the chefs stretch and fold the noodle dough into thin , fiber-like strands . it was like having dinner and a show simultaneously as you watched them pull the dough with straight , quick tugs and every now and then , someone will slam the dough against their prep boards to ensure uniform thickness . i didn ' t see any chefs do this in their new location , which is a shame because the act of watching these artists is worth the trip as well . i ordered the sliced beef noodle soup . fragrant , delicious broth that is flavorful but not heavy and oily . fresh , thick noodles that are chewy and handmade . tender and savory slices of beef . and pickled vegetables on top that help balance everything out . the menu boasts of many choices such as beef brisket , ox tail , lamb , pork chop , roast duck , and much more . you can also opt for other dishes like shredded pork stir fried noodles or roast pork fried rice . my big bowl of beef noodle soup was N . N . inexpensive , but filling and mouthwatering . if you ' re in philly , you must stop by and try nan zhou hand drawn noodle house . 
there ' s a lot of pizza in the area , but zio ' s is my favorite for a quick slice and a soda . unlike some other places , they never skimp on reheating slices in the oven . their eggplant pizza is particularly nice . i also recommend the fried dough with powdered sugar . 
the good salsa verde , nachos , el caliente , pitchers of margaritas the not so good flavorless tacos unless you doctor them up with salsas , jalepenos , hot sauce , etc . . . great if you dont mind very loud places , disappointing if you want to hear your date talking . just read lips , drink your margarita , and take it for what it is . 
exquisite ! ! ! this place was simply amazing ! ! everything tasted delicious . oyster selection was incredible ! ! ! great wine selection too ! ! when you walk in the music was perfect , atmosphere a bit cozier than i ' d like but still everything is soo good it ' s stupid to care about that . very . very , very attentive waitstaff ! ! ! great place for a date ! ! great place to catch up with friends ! ! 
like the food ! but dont come to this place after happy hour ( Npm ) my friend and i each had a salad and N very small glasses of wine and the bill with tax ( and they take cash only ) N . . . please management dont charge N for a tiny glass of wine . your wine prices are not listed anywhere other wise i would have avoided paying N for wine . 
N dumplings for N ? ? yes , please ! dumpling was yummy and juicy . tiny tiny place , but i don ' t care because i don ' t eat in . sanitation wise , very questionable . -N star . it ' s N dumpling , so who cares . 
the pizza is excellent . truly a good representation of the greatness in pizza that new haven has established in it ' s reputation of great cuisines . they deliver in a timely manner . they are in the middle of the price range , spending around N for a large pizza with toppings and the only reason i don ' t give then N stars is because the pizza has been undercooked N out of N times we have ordered from them and they got our order wrong once . but this is not enough to stop us from ordering from them , great pizza ! 
the beef bulgogi is off the hook ! had better viet iced coffee though . still , this place did not disappoint ! 
my husband ( a chef ) and i decided to try this place out last night based on the good reviews here on yelp . we sat at the sushi bar , and were immediately greeted with a gorgeous complimentary sashimi dish with fried scallions and ponzu sauce . that was a sign that we were not in any ordinary sushi joint , and we felt immediately like we were going to be welcomed in to an amazing culinary experience . our waiter , eric , was extremely attentive as well as passionate about the various kinds of sakes and their origins and preparations , and he recommended a couple of the specials they were featuring that both sounded incredible . we both love when a place has passionate and knowledgeable service , and allowed them to take us on a bit of a " best of " journey . the sushi and sashimi was creatively presented , sensational and truly fresh . one of the specials was a clam sashimi dish that was truly one of the best sashimi dishes we have ever experienced . each clam slice was laid over a perfectly thin slice of lemon , layered over a huge bowl of shaved ice and kissed with finely diced scallion and tobiko . it came with an ponzu horseradish celery dipping sauce , and was decorated with an enormous clam shell and springs of reeds . we also enjoyed a beautiful special spicy tuna salmon roll wrapped in pink nori and served with four sauces that were beautifully designed along the plate like a dragon . the american sashimi ( tuna , salmon and yellowtail ) was incredibly fresh and melted on your tongue , and was prepared a bit like a tight-rope act of balanced bowls and glasses . eric offered us various tastes of other sakes to compliment our dishes as well , just improving upon the experience . the location is odd- in a desolate strip mall of the silas dean hwy . inside is small and dark though , so it could be somewhat romantic . it was very clean , including the bathroom . the presentation of the dishes was a tinge over-the-top , but the bells and whistles of massive tree branches and balanced martini glasses was overcome by the incredible freshness and gorgeous care and preparation . the sushi chef obviously took great creative pride in the preparation , and even though it is a bit showy , we embraced it . my husband and i feel we just found a little secret place to get an nyc-grade sushi meal without the hassle . it was delicious , and we will be back . highly recommended ! ! ! 
i stopped going to patsy ' s in midtown ( the high-priced sit down place in midtown , not the much better pizza place ) because the quality has slipped so much . a client who has a table at rao ' s brought me here and i discovered this fantastic treasure ! everything that patsy ' s falls short on is done to perfection at rao ' s . the sauce is as good as the homemade that my mother used to make . the veal cutlets , my favorite , are tender and fresh . the pasta is served hot , hot , hot and not lukewarm because i think they make it fresh to order . the atmosphere is home , not tacky and pretentious like patsy ' s and a few other highfalutin ' italian restaurants in midtown are . if you ever have the chance get into rao ' s . it ' s not easy but it ' s well worth the wait
fantastic lunch prices , even on weekends . lunch plates were less than N . most thai places in the area are very small but room service is very spacious so you can actually take your time enjoying your food and not be rushed out due to a line of people waiting for a table . everything we ordered was very good . is it the best thai food ever ? no , but for the price and the space , it ' s a gem in the neighborhood . would definitely go back . 
do not waste your time or money ! ! ! the place is dark and dingy , the food takes forever to be prepared , the owners are rude and snobby . customer service is terrible ! ! ! ! go somewhere else ! we ' ve given this place too many chances . . . . very very disappointed . 
this new cafe is most welcome to the neighborhood , which lacks a decent lunch spot . although the vibe is really nice , everyone is friendly , and the menu is decent , these guys could use a couple of tips with the food . i have two main problems N ) bacon fat . N ) portions . N ) i know there is a trend toward loving fat these days , but everything has a limit . bacon fat in your burger ? come on guys . bacon fat in your apple confit on the turkey sandwich ? why ? the reason we needed a new lunch spot was to have a lighter lunch . . . if i want lard , i ' ll go to one of the many mexican joints . please lighten up ! N ) the portions for many of their sandwiches are pretty tiny . if you get a salad side instead of potatoes you can count on being hungry in the next couple of hours . an exception is the tuna melt , which is really nice . the worst portion is the daily scramble . . . i ' m sad to say that this dish was really disappointing . portion was tiny , the potatoes were overcooked and had been sitting around . and i could have made much better eggs at home . ( sorry ! ) i ' ll probably keep going here because i ' m in the neighborhood and i want to support them , but i hope they read these reviews and take them to heart . they are great people , they have the right idea , and they are just starting out . i would definitely give them time to figure these things out and will continue to return , hoping for these improvements to take place . 
absolutely fabulous . my sister is vegetarian and they had a gnocchi appetizer special that night . i tasted it and it was great ! her entree was the black trumpet sheep ' s milk ricotta cannelloni . it was also very , very good . it took me two bites before i really appreciated her food . i mean cmon , it ' s vegetarian . hah . no really , perilla ' s veggie food is very good . the duck meatballs are a must for your first time . definitely get more than one appetizer because they are incredible . i ordered the grilled branzino and was surprised with each bite . the texture and taste was fabulous . until perilla i never had a kaffir lime leaf sauce - it was really cool how it was used with this dish . i ' m used to it being used in thai food mixed in with many other spices . the bold flavor really heightened the dish . we asked our server to pair wine with our entrees , the wine we had by the glass was outstanding . i ' m glad to have trusted the server ' s recommendation here . per yelp we also ordered the doughnuts . i knew they were going to be good but we had no idea about the filling and it was a pleasant and delightful surprise . the lightly flavored chocolate cream sauce on the side was also an excellent accompaniment . these dishes are very well thought out . if i were a local i ' d be eating here a lot . sadly i am an atlantan but one who plans on visiting perilla about every other trip to ny ! 
we ' ve been living in brooklyn for seven years now and have never had such a horrible experience anywhere in the city so far . it didn ' t look too bad first when we saw how many nice italian wines by the glass they had on the menu . but their drunk bartender meagan gave us the worst attitude the whole time we were there , give us looks and threw nasty comments like how much she hated all things foreign ( us not being from the states originally ) or how little she cared whether we enjoyed our wine or not . although there were a lot of people there besides us , meagan kept saying she had to close the bar and how late it was -- it was not even midnight . . . . a new customer walked in , she did serve him a drink but kept saying she was doing him a favor . we felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome there . and on top of that we saw a big well-fed roach searching the counter for leftover food . spend your money elsewhere ! ! ! 
love the food and the atmosphere ! definitely the place to go for a night out , margaritas are huge , delicious , and strong . free chips and salsa , but order the ranch to dip your chips in as well . the wait here can be very long , especially on the weekends , so come early , or be prepared to wait awhile ( on the plus side , you can always order margaritas while you wait ! ) . since they are usually so busy , it can get quite loud , so i wouldn ' t recommend for an intimate dinner for two , or to bring young children very late . they don ' t serve dessert , however , they do serve delicious cornbread which is just as good . if your meal doesn ' t already come with it , definitely order a side . staff is all very friendly and helpful . overall , great spot . too bad there aren ' t more jose tejas restaurants in the area ! 
hole in the wall with good food . plate portions are small but filling . if you ' re on the run and need a quick fix then this is def worth it . a bang for your buck ! 
it ' s not as though this place needs any more positive reviews , but i ' d love to just hop on the band-wagon and say this place is a must . definitely my favorite meal i have had in my four times visiting nyc . place has a great vibe , there will be a wait ( ours only took N minutes ) but the wait staff are friendly with great style and personalities , so you won ' t hate waiting . i know i should have gotten spicy pork , but my love for pesto is stronger than my love for meat , so i went with chicken . it was the effing best thing . i tried a bit of the spicy pork sando though , it was the business , too . 
we were so excited to have our sons rehearsal dinner for N people here ! unfortunately , it did not go well . we arrived on a cold march night and were told that the propane that heats the bow deck had not been delivered that week so there was no heat . we spent the evening in our coats . it was not until after my husband and son said they were going to home depot for propane did they bring in more heaters . my son got one heater to work . we had preordered for the group and the roasted pig was supposed to be plentiful according to christine the sales manager . it fed maybe N . when i went for dinner the salad bowls were empty and i had to ask for more lettuce . the meat was gone and i was told there was no more . after a long debate i was told they would bring something else out which they did . shredded pork ? about N minutes later . . . . at thiis point it had been last call . our pastor had been given a piece of skin and was told there was no more meat we brought a cake which was thrown on a table the coffee was served from the bar and when you asked for cream . . you were handed a container of heavy cream . embarrassing yes but the worst part is that after a discussion with the manger who stated he would . call me back . . . . i have received no response after N more phone calls do not trust these people ! there was no excuse for not having heat , not refilling a salad bowl , inadequate amounts of food and the worst customer service i have ever experienced . march N , N
this is place is the business . if you want something cheap and quick , this is that joint , my dude dudette . the waiters don ' t speak english very well and can come across as very rude to non-chinese customers , but the food is on point . get the duck over rice or any of the noodle dishes , and i guarantee you ' ll come back to this spot . ask any native chinese new yorker about this place , and he ' ll she ' ll tell you that it ' s a must-visit . the dishes are rich in flavors . just don ' t expect that N-star service . this is chinatown , homie . " service " isn ' t in our dictionary . 
sub-par brisket on the dry side . the sauce at the table was good , but you don ' t want to cover good brisket with sauce -- unfortunately i kept going for the sauce . the side of beans with burnt ends was too saucy , heavy on tomato . the side of mac n cheese with queso was solid . the lamb banh mi sandwich had a good taste but the proportion of bread to meat was too heavy on the bread . the space was really nice in a fixed-up-warehouse kind of way . there is a lot of room and a good bar . if you ' re at fairway it ' s decent for lunch . otherwise not worth the trek . 
great selection for a quick pick up . fast delivery . not the best pizza i have had but consistent and reasonably priced . 
great pasta ! 
what a find ! my boyfriend and i went there recently and had a lovely dinner . nice warm atmosphere and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful . we both had the tasting meal and for the price its the best in the city . the food was fantastic ! i can not wait to go back . 
peaches has been a neighborhood staple since the days of akwaaba for a weekend brunch . the table ordered the jim cade breakfast with granola crusted french toast fresh fruit crispy red potatoes and applewoood bacon and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and it seriously hit the spot leaving us all full and content . brunch wouldnt be complete with a cocktail so rounds of brooklyn brownstones were ordered . there had to be a new bartender mixing the batch as the cocktail was off this week-it was too bitter and not refreshing . the bartender just added more simple syrup and it made it tolerable but erased the idea of ordering a secind round . this is not a negative towards a great brunch option in bed-stuy as we will brunch again ! 
i really love the monk room . the caesar salad is heavenly with the whole anchovies and the maple dessert is super tasty . i ' ve sampled a few of their other dishes with nothing but happiness and indulged in a few yummy snowbird cocktails . it ' s probably the closest place i ' ve found in newark that ' s hipster ( ipa ' s on tap ! ) - which i sort of like - ) my only suggestion concern the prices are a bit high . if this was in hoboken or on grove street the prices would be fine . and the place is inexpensive compared to nyc . but for downtown newark , where there ' s a lot of gov ' t and non-profit workers , it ' s a bit much . the price definitely limits how often i go - especially with other places in the immediate area offering N drink specials and much cheaper salads . maybe have a half price lunch or dinner ? or offer happy hour specials that include food ? 
terrible policy ! we arrived for brunch , asked for a table , but there wasn ' t one available so we say at the bar . before our food arrived , several tables opened and no one was waiting , so we asked to move . we were told by the manager that it was policy never to allow a customer to move . our daughter left in disgust and our special family breakfast was ruined . we won ' t be back ! 
overall great experience great atmosphere enjoyed the food and service was good definitely will be back
you ' d think a restaurant with a lard-bucket owner would be sensitive to the seating needs of the " husky gentleman " , but this place is tiny , with tiny little chairs from the door store ' s keebler collection . i took a deep breath when i entered , and exhaled when i left . the food is alright . i liked the grilled sepia plate . 
it is the tail end of lunchtime on a friday , and there are throngs of people at both geno ' s and pat ' s , crowds creeping back out onto the road . we decide to hit geno ' s first . juliet volunteers to order , having boned up on proper etiquette . there is a window for cheese steaks , and another window for drinks and fries . while she waits in the longer line , i acquire a birch beer and some cheese fries . signs in the windows proclaim geno ' s support for trump in the next presidential race warnings if you don ' t speak english or you don ' t order correctly and plenty of star-spangled banners . it feels like i ' m at a tea party rally . with a bit of luck and patience , we secure a small picnic table and unveil the beast . we tear the foot long in half , then dig in . the bread is soft the shaved meat is juicy the onions are sweet , weeping and the cheese whiz is . . . well , cheese whiz . in the end , it is nothing special , just a somewhat thin sub with some anemic , salty , and overly-processed ingredients . the birch beer does wonders to wash it down . the cheese fries are pretty good , though . better than the sandwich . eager to work our way up the food chain , we cross the street and prepare for pat ' s . i step up this time to order , paying close attention to the instructions printed next to the window . i say , " one provolone wit " . translation " one cheesesteak with provolone cheese and with onions . " i feel like a local when the guy takes my money , hands back the change , and another guy shoves a sub at me . i ' m getting the hang of this ! unfortunately , there are no available seats . people are like scavengers , rushing to the nearest open picnic table and wolfing down their late lunches . we end up at one of the standing rails , clustered close together against the brisk wind . the sandwich tears apart easily . i take my first bite and prepare for the onslaught of meat and cheese . . . only to be met with nothing . nada . zip . bupkis . i don ' t taste bread , meat , onions , or cheese . what in tarnation ? i eat more slowly , rolling each bite around on my tongue , trying to tease the flavors out . still , it eludes me . the preparation is either too light a touch , or geno ' s has ruined me . maybe that ' s their secret weapon ruin your taste buds before you try the competition . but don ' t take my word for it . read what my better half has to say on our website ( linked in my profile ) . 
i attended a dual birthday celebration here and was well pleased with the quality of service . the decor and ambiance are delightful to the senses and very comfortable . our large group was able to unwind and enjoy ourselves easily . our arrangement was for Npp for passed appetizers and bottles of wine . apps were quite good , the wine not so much . i would return but be more discerning with the house delgated wine choice . 
very genuine korean food and the people running it were very korean . a bit pricey though . 
neat place with good food , cool staff , all in all , not a bad spot ) 
can i choose " N " stars ? this is not only a subpar cheesesteak , but add an unnecessary wait and horrible staff to the mix and you have hands-down one of the worst establishments in philadelphia . to think that people would actually wait for a cheesesteak in philly is crazy . to visitors of philadelphia , there are at least N other places right in this area where you wouldn ' t wait in line and have a better experience of a philly cheesesteak . though you may have nothing to compare against , good is still good , which pat ' s is not . 
myself and a few colleagues decided last minute we would work through lunch to complete a project we were working on so we ordered takeout at the new jg domestic located in the lobby . well , what a mistake , a few of us ordered burgers only to have them prepared all wrong and with only the bottom bun . i was the only one who decided to take my burger back and have it prepared the way it was ordered . it was prepared wrong again and the manager ' s short anwsers and negative body languge said it all . after waiting another half hour they finally got it right and the burger turned out to be excellent . however , when i checked the burger before leaving i asked the manger about the fries and he said if you think i need to change them then i will . this is the comment that cemented my experience and caused me to write this review . in closing , everybody else was professional and gracious , but the beauty about money is it doesn ' t go bad and they never have to worry about my patronage again ! ! ! ! ! 
huge portions , great sweet potato fries . just a bit pricey and takes a while to get your food . 
this place was amazing ! a little small but the food , and service was great ! very attentive staff . and jose was an amazing server ! the mimosas were delicious ! definitely a go to spot for brunch ! 
the crab roll was really but too small
we were back recently after N years and have to say the quality seems to have receded . the mussels in vinegar was much too salty , the deviled eggs were underwhelming , and the cheese wrapped in prosciutto wasn ' t good at all . the squid ink rice was the redeeming dish of the night , and the service was excellent . 
the menu recently changed to include non-americanized dishes . in contrast to the usual complacency of princeton restaurants , eps corner is actually improving at a fast rate ! best dishes are -string bean and tofu in garlic sauce ( the tofu is fried and puffy , the sauce appropriately tangy ) eggplant in garlic sauce -spicy pot ( can ' t find this flavor within N miles ) -crispy salt and pepper pork chops ( so tender and crisp ) -beef and pickle noodle soup ( hearty , generous , flavor is as it should be ) -dumplings ( better than the standard potsticker ) -crispy diced chicken in peppers ( popcorn chicken , sichuan style ) -cumin beef definitely the best chinese restaurant in princeton . 
beating a dead horse , writing about how good the sandwiches are , so i ' ll just add a few tips . sit at the bar and add a ton of the peppers , absolutely delicious . also , if you ' re taking one home and you live more than a block away , it ' ll get soggy . ask for takeout and they ' ll pack everything separate so you can reassemble when you get home . also , avoid on saturdays unless you love being smushed by huge crowds . 
love it . i heart the turkey burger with brie , and i don ' t feel like i have broken the bank after eating a meal there . it is a fun place to go for a trendier meal with friends , but it ' s true talent is the brunch . i ' m a huge fan of the tator tots and the mac ' n cheese is mean . i ' m also a fan of the Ns inspired decor . 
i was so excited to try this place and it did not disappoint . it was literally the best macarons i have ever tasted ! i got the raspberry and the blackberry current to try . the outside has a nice little crust while the inside was so soft . it is definitely delicate ! also , it isn ' t too sweet ! i loved the atmosphere here , it looks like a very cute french bakery shop . i wish i could go back and order more ! 
great place to eat . best mexican food in ct . good portions , service is good . never had a bad dish of the menu . visit and enjoy ! 
i do love this place ' s eccentric decor and intimate atmosphere . you can ' t find too many places like this in the area , so it ' s pretty unique . however , the food is mediocre at best and way too pricey for what they give you . i still recommend this place for its beverages and ambiance , though . 
was very excited to test out this place after all the ramen hype . was just at ippudo and was impressed . we did go a little early , around Np and still had to wait about N mins . the place is super tiny , very tokyo like , which was fine . but sitting at the bar with your legs dangling and no where to put your bag told you this is not a place to sit , take your time to hang out and chit chat . so we order couple of apps , the ika ( squide ) skewers . very dry and practically couldn ' t take it off the sticks without eating it like a caveman . then we got the avo tuna , very very well seasoned with the avocado , pleasantly surprised . now for the true test , spicy ramen . the ramen noodles were not the usual kind , more spaghetti like and not curly . stil , it was good . not great . the atmosphere is cool , with all workers prety much at arms reach . overall , it was good . i think there are better ramen places out there without the wait . back to ippudo . 
yummy , yummy i love italian pizza flavor is awesome
juniper was a lovely lunch haven during my recent trip to ny . a haven because while it ' s definitely small , it ' s also quaint and polite and i didn ' t feel at all as though i was being rushed in and out so that my table could be turned as many times as possible . perhaps the difference between eating lunch and eating dinner or maybe it ' s the difference between eating in manhattan and eating in brooklyn . i don ' t know . but , i do know that i enjoyed the fact that it felt like the restaurant wanted me there for as long as i wanted to be there . ( which , by the way was under an hour . i mean it ' s lunch time you know ? ) the exposed brick insides and chalk menus reminded me of some of my favorite spots in denver and the menu itself reminded me of my delicious childhood in the south with a fancy touch at times . things like the mac and cheese should be devoured . things like the burgers should be savored , especially if it ' s truffled . things like the waffles fries should be at all restaurants that serve any kind of fries . ( what is it about waffling that makes a fry so much better ? i may never know . . . ) this spot is cash only so be prepared for that . and when i say they didn ' t rush us i also mean they were slow to take our order or bring our check so don ' t go if you ' re in a hurry or an impatient person in general . or if you do go at least be prepared for this . all in all if i lived anywhere near this spot you ' d probably see my mug on the regulars check-in board here because it was a damn fine experience . 
worse service ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i went there with my family and we waited in the cold for over an hour , they kept telling us we will be next and the table we were waiting for finally cleared ! and ! ! ! they sat another group of ppl on that table which they came wayyyyyy after us ! just because those ppl know the staff over there ! ! ! speechless ! ! ! ! ! ! and the food werent so good anyway , not worth the wait and the hpassle ! we ended up just left that stupid place ! never going back again ! worse place i ' ve ever been to . . . . . . . 
the last time i was at fork i was lucky enough to go with a large enough party that we were seated in one of their spacious back rooms . . . otherwise , the dining room is a little too " cozy " for me , but i do love the space . the backroom was great as we were a group of friends from college significant others all catching up after not seeing each other for months , so we were pretty loud obnoxious , so the back room was perfect . the service at fork is friendly and the food is tasty . . . although its on the pricier side . i love their sunday champagne breakfast and am not afraid to admit that i have spent an entire afternoon here sipping mimosa ' s and wasting an entire day just eating and drinking . great for groups ! 
yawp . 
the pork belly was to die for and the wine was delicious . it is a must . 
excellent place , great place to share plates , although beware some plates are very small but their price may not reflect that . spicy rice cakes is a good plate to share and the pork buns are amazing . definately get one or two for your self . menu changes often , so good place that you may not get bored with . milk bar is next store and has great cookies . 
this isn ' t the Nst time i ' ve eaten at andrews , and won ' t be the last my favorite is his falafel sandwich which i can not have enough of . but today i ordered his vegetarian salad , which is out of this world . all fresh ingredients and very tasty . i would give this man a thumbs up for all the work he puts into all his cooking . his soups are excellent and all gluten free and creamy , again i have a favorite of his soups . butternut squash , and before i started eating at andrews , i never had this soup . it ' s simply delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! this item alone i would give a N star . i heard that he was bill clinton ' s private chef , i don ' t know how the man let this owner of this cafe go . i agree with riss h . he does deserve a nobel prize for his delicious gluten free healthy cooking . his ideas are fantastic ! ! ! 
excellent food , great service , fast , cozy and reasonable price , totally recommend it ! ! 
omg ! ! ! i loved this place . my wallet hated it . d the food was great , lamb was dry , but everything else was great . they have this strawberry thing in a glass . omg ! ! one of my favorite desserts . staff was friendly . felt a little stuffy though . tables too close together . very expensive . spent N a person there . i mean , that ' s not donald trump expensive , but damn , for me that ' s up there in price . N drink , food , dessert and tip . i ' d go again in a heart beat . been there a few times , loved it every time . lunch i cheaper , but less variety . dress to impress , but once you ' re in there , unbuckle the belt , it ' s time to stretch that stomach ! ! 
cant say anything except that this place is oneof the best ! 
cute little wine bar , came here with two friends . . got a bottle of wine , some cheese plate . . the pizza here looked good . if you ' re looking for a quiet and casual spot to go to up in this area , this is it ! 
if you come here for breakfast . three words . big boy breakfast ! for N buckaroos you can get a variety of dishes that will sure you make you full . my eyes are always bigger than my stomach . my big boy breakfast included standard scrambled eggs potatoes turkey sausages french toast each of the portion are huge and full orders of each , not just mini side orders . service was lovely . the food came out not too long after we ordered . the restaurant has a fancy and interesting kind of interior design . super clean . it is in a downtown district so transportation is not an issue . you can either take the train ( the train station is about a half a block away . after , you walk off your big boy breakfast by frolicking around the district . there are cute little shops from N-N block radius . 
i love mario batali ' s no pretense kind of places . casa mono and bar jamon are two of them . my initial plan was to go to bar jamon . but of course when we got there at N . Npm , the place is packed like there is no tomorrow and we were starving plus not wanting to wait outside in Nf weather . so we headed to casa mono . price tapas style , most plates cost about N- N . to share is the way to go at this place . ambience i love the open kitchen style . we opted to sit at the bar facing the kitchen and the entire night we had the chance to see the chef and kitchen crew in action . service is prompt . wine beer very lengthy . my friend is not a wine person so we didn ' t order any - can ' t opine . food presented very beautifully . mind you we were seating at the kitchen bar , so we saw the parade of food coming out . they all look so fantastic . we ordered N items duck egg with mojama over easy duck egg over potatoes tossed in truffle oill . beautiful and divine . use that bread to sucks up the runny egg yolk and truffle goodness . this is probably one of their most popular dishes . we saw at least N of them made during our N hrs there . and the chef mastered it well , not one broken egg the entire time . bravo ! pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas interesting concept and executed quite well . i wish they are a little bit more generous with the goat cheese . lamb chops with garbanzos and harissa perfectly medium rare . the garbanzo ( chickpeas ) are all coated with beautiful garlic harissa mixture . what i will try cause they looked so beautiful duck breast with roasted sunchokes and tomatoes pulpo with fennel and grapefruit calamares fritos till next time . 
looking for some sort of pizza , are you ? interested in observing the lifestyle of the hip in the wild ? and you want to learn about the history of pizza ? well , you ' ll get two out of three of them here . i was excited to check out pizza brain because i ' d heard it was great pizza and they had a pizza museum , one of the first of its ' kind ? at first glance , they place was packed on a friday evening , and i stood around asking others if we were in line to order . my friend and i each ordered one of the two slices they had available jane ( plain ) and leonard bookman ( mozzarella , fontina , ricotta , black pepper , garlic , fresh oregano ) . while waiting a few minutes for our pizza , we tried walking around the crowded place and viewing this ' museum ' i ' d heard of . all i found was a few trinkets on the wall and in the floor which i couldn ' t read due to people shuffling kegs around ( it ' s byo ? ) and a lack of space . next time i ' m not going on a friday evening . i was a little let down with the museum aspect of pizza brain , but i had pizza on the brain , and it was time to eat . we were called for our four slices , and due to lack of room inside , and the rain outdoors , we resorted to eating in the car . would have preferred indoors , obviously , but as i said , wasn ' t much space with the ice-cream shop connected next door ( i ' ll be back to try this ! ) . now , i am a firm believer that a plain slice of pizza is a great indicator of the quality of the pizza at any particular establishment . individual slices of pizza are a different cut than those from a whole pie , clearly . the jane slice was pretty damn good , the sauce was fresh tasting and had a great taste overall , and the crust and dough for the pizza was cooked just right . i ate the whole crust of all our slices . cooked to crispiness , but on the inside it was still nice and fluffy . the leonard slice was bangin ' . ricotta was cooked just right , and there were healthy portions of it on the slice . not too overpowering cheeses , and again , crust was cooked to taste great . the toppings mixed well and tasted great . overall , the slices were decently sized for the price , but i still think it was a bit overpriced . especially for the whole pie , you can get a similar priced pizza of greater stature down in south philly . if you don ' t know where i ' m talking about , check out my upcoming reviews . i ' ll be back to check out the ice cream shop and give it another shot , hopefully soon . 
i have been going to this place all my life ( i ' m N years old ) and i love there food ! ! ! its delicious ! ! ! can ' t get enough of their breaded chicken and black beans and rice . ropa vieja ( a shredded beef stew dish ) excellent ! ! ! 
best part about this cart is they are open late night and the food is awesome
after a recent visit to acacia on my birthday i was extremely underwhelmed . when we first read over the menu we thought " wow , we ' re in for a great meal ! everything sounds delicious ! " then they brought out the cold bread and olive oil ( not extra virgin . . . almost clear and tasteless olive oil and no butter ) and we began thinking " well , the first course has to be good ! " we were wrong . after what seemed like an eternity our appetizers arrived . the " chilled jumbo shrimp and lobster cocktail " should be called " N room temperature medium shrimp and minced lobster salad " . the cocktail sauce was squeezed on top of the shrimp with what looked like a tube of toothpaste . yummy ! the " thai vegetable spring rolls " were greasy and flavorless . the peanut sauce was ok but i ' ve had better out of a jar . next up was the " duck breast and confit " average at best and overcooked . . . also no duck confit . . just a sliced breast and duck leg with mushy risotto ! " spice rubbed tuna " was obviously frozen and not fresh . the color was light pink at best and the presentation was extremely sloppy . needless to say we will never return to this overpriced faux fine dining establishment . if you still want to try it out after reading this review i suggest you bring a lot of wine . 
the food was good , but that does not outweigh the fact that we were treated with rudeness by the manager , who asked us to leave while we were still enjoying our coffee . it had not been N minutes after we paid our bill when he told us there were people " waiting for our table . " when i mentioned how rude that was , he told me i could call back and complain if i wanted to . i have been going to bella ' s for N years and always took out-of-town guests there . but i will no longer patronize this restaurant . 
the best bagels around ! ! also good coffee and friendly service , it ' s a must when i visit home . 
amazing ! great service , wonderful food . though the place hasn ' t been open long , i ' ve been several times . the food is excellent , the servers are friendly and very knowledgable considering that they have only been open N short weeks . the cocktail list is wonderful and impressive . comfortable atmosphere , amazing food- i can ' t say enough positive things ! 
i hate that i love this place . it really could arguably deserve N stars but i ' m reserving that holy spot for difara . the pizza is bomb ass , worth whatever it costs and however long you wait . haven ' t had a calzone yet - but that will be my next adventure there . . . 
beware- they serve hige portions . . . ordered the famous chicken cutlet grinder- could not even fimish half of the half-grinder ) chicken cutlet was ok i would say- not the best of the sauce though . owners are very friendly and courteous . note- they do not accept cards here ! so , the next time you wanna check out this place , make sure you have enough cash on you . 
always enjoy the food and infused drinks . and the happy hour has free food . they could use a more thoughtful tap selection . a fancy bar like that needs some better quality beers to complement the extensive wine list . get on their facebook email list etc . this winter they offered some snow storm N for N specials , a rarity in wh center . 
the best queso fundido i ' ve ever had ! ! i love this mexican food hideaway their burritos quesadillas are delicious ! 
there isn ' t too much to say except best burger in staten island . it ' s a pub so expect this when you go . there isn ' t much in the way of seating and the the place is pretty packed on weekends . but if you go early enough on a friday or saturday night , you should be able to get a small table . i can ' t speak for much of the menu . i can tell you that the nachos and wings are decent , not disappointing but not anything special either . the burgers , on the other hand , are much more than you ' d expect from bar food and exactly what you want in a greasy-cheesy burger . in my opinion , stick with the cheeseburger on an english muffin with a side of waffle fries , a few drinks and enjoy ! 
there ' s always a line here so i decided to give it a try . the quantity , the speed and the price . they are good . so even with a long line , it goes fast . all have been prepared ahead of time . this vote is strictly for quality . i ' d spend a bit more for better quality chicken and beef . minced meats tend to mask good quality . but for a quick meal that will fill you up , this is a good option . 
wow ! wonderful soup ! this is the kinda soup ive been looking for ! the workers were so friendly , kind and let us sample as many soups as we wanted . everything we tried was just incredible ! it was really hard to decide . a in my book . 
we had dinner here and it was disgusting . the food tastes like it was microwaved , the drinks are seems like juice glasses ( small ) . service was so-so which means they are s l o w very slow . they put cone out in the street ( not legal ) which is against the law where are the police ? maybe they are eating for free or else bough commander might be getting a little something on the side , either way there is a law which says you cannot hold spots on a public street . so why are no summons being issued ? i would rather eat across the street at the elm park inn the portions are much bigger and the service is much quicker also the help is more friendly . 
went back for idli . for N . N you get N idli ' s with sambar and your choice of chutney . i feel like the entire purpose of idli is texture . it really doesn ' t have a taste . the rice and lentil flour made to use the idly was extremely fine , but the idli was almost too soft and lacked the chewyness that i ' ve had before . the idli fell apart , as if it were frozen and not reheated properly . the idli are big , though , and i was hungry so i ate it . ( not big on wasting food . ) sambar was mediocre . i ' ve had better i ' ve had worse . needs to have more kick . all in all , if you are desperately craving idli and sambar , then not a bad deal . i ' ll stick to curry hill or edison for my south indian treats . the potato dosa is still very good and i would give this review N . N stars if i could . 
my husband and i visited new york city this passed week for a few days . on friday night we stumbled upon district tap house for dinner in the garment district . it was a delightful experience . the food was great and so was the service . special thanks to christina , sophie , and shawn ! 
great local place . always quick , friendly service , food is consistently delicious . pizza has a nice thin crispy crust . my office gets lunch at least a couple days a week , everyone loves their aniello ' s salads with grilled chicken and the bacon and chicken pizza is another favorite of ours . 
pork buns , oh how i miss thee ! ! ! i ' m not a ramen lover so i really don ' t care about the ramen . . . meaning that i definitely don ' t go to ippudo for the noodles . what i do go for , however , are the friggin pork buns ! ! ! and you should too ! they are so good . i ' m craving some now and i wish i could eat it but i ' m on the west coast ( short story eat the pork buns . you will not be disappointed . 
stopped in for some take out . the staff was really nice . invited me to the bar and made suggestions for a good entree . the decor was really interesting with tree branches hanging from the ceiling . i ' d like to come back to eat in one day . i ordered the kao soy with chicken . it was a soup with curry broth . the broth was really great . it has coconut milk in it and was the perfect blend of sweet and savory flavors . the portion was a good size . i paid N even with N ' s worth of tax . i ' d come back again . 
yeah , it ' s small and cheap ! cheap ! cheap ! also very greasy , so be sure to have some good tea to wash it down . we only spent N and got N pot stickers and N deep fried dumplings with beef fillings . they tasted pretty normal and fresh . my throat was feeling a bit scratchy from eating them but i didn ' t get sick . that ' s a plus ! it ' s probably from all the oil that they used . 
traveling through new england it can be difficult at times to know where to turn for above average food . the distance between fine dinning establishments and the cold ( in winter ) can conspire to lock you into many a marginal place . keeper ' s if far from this . a warm , enviting location with the feel of a little bit of city style ( rather than overly new england ) makes this place a standout in southern central vermont . the food menu is varied and represents a number of fusion elements that make each dish intriguing and tasty . the service is superior , informed and friendly . the standout entrees the night we were there included the sirloin and the shrimp risotto . the beet salad and very unique tequilla infused gravlax were the stars of the apetizers . a special cheesecake made its way to our table and we can only hope it finds its way to the menu . 
i celebrated my birthday here this past saturday and it was such a blast ! we were running late for our table reservation so i was pleasantly surprised when i received a call from the gm , colby asking me if i was still on the way and letting me know our tables were ready for me . big kudos for that . our tables were right by the dj booth and the music was so good . a mix of everything from old school hip hop to top N ' s . drink prices were reasonable and the tapas were delicious ! the only con about this place is that it was kind of hot in there . . . turn up the ac please ! the rest of my night is a little hazy but all i remember is that i had a blast ! fat buddha , you happy me so . 
this bakery is great , especially since i have had a life-long affair with it . i ' ve tried innumerable cookies , cake slices , and cream puffs from here . admittedly , i have tried the savory foods , breads , or gelatos . my favorites are the cream puffs , chocolate mousse cake , and then italian cream fruit cake . the almond paste cookies are great as well . stop by to marvel at the giant cases of italian pastries and other baked goods . this place has been in business for decades for a reason . 
one if the best beer selections i ' ve seen . the food is also really good . a fun place to go but gets really crowded at times . 
great tuna tartar . delicious sangria and best pizza in brooklyn . . . . fantastic service " ill be back " 
walked in last night without a reservation with a girlfriend and since the tables are thisclose together , had a nice conversation with the couple next to us . who assumed we were on a date . because it ' s the gayborhood , yo ? we ' re not gay , not that there is anything wrong with that , you know . we started with the pig popcorn ( which was just okay ) and then moved onto the pizza with pear , gorgonzola , walnuts , arugula and pancetta . it was amazing . a smallish pizza , but hearty and filling . i ' m still thinking about it . we also shared the stuffed meatballs in red sauce . they were tasty but a little pricey , at N bucks for just two . what kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the wine . we ordered a bottle of the N garrida vinho tinto portuguese red , which at N was more than Nx you can find it for in the wine shop . ah , well . i still ordered it and drank it up like a big old boozebag . i guess beggars cannot be complainers , right ? four stars . 
the food is best . and nice family . fast delivery because they have three driver now . i order from them almost N years . they keep good business
great selection . delicious gin and cocktails . N N bottled wine on tuesdays- can ' t beat that bartender matt is wonderful and always carries a brilliant conversation with us . can get really crowded on the weekends- so get early . there ' s coat hooks everywhere . doormen are always kind . 
by far my Nnd favorite place for a scrumptious burger - dethrone by raoul ' s bar burger . the signature black label burger is as juicy as it gets . do yourself and the rest of humanity a favor and order it med . rare . i would order the steak for two with bone marrow , but i ' d prolly drop dead on the spot . 
i loved it . i am picky about my pizza and was a bit skeptical . i am not a fan of the famous new haven style ( read burned ) pizza , but this was wonderful . will definitely go back
best chicken ever . it ' s cooked to perfection . travels well too . i took it from manhattan to westchester county . 
extremely solid ramen in the west village for a great price ! i finally got a chance to try out this noodle joint after being recommended it a few weeks ago by a fellow yelper ( shoutout to joanna n . ! ) . the shop is in a space that looks like it used to be in an apartment , which gives it a homey feel . the menu is pretty straightforward , and i tried the shoyu tonkotsu ramen . the broth was good , not too salty , and well seasoned , but still falls into the same issue that most tonkotsu broths in the city face - it ' s rich , but not as thick and rich as it should be ( it tastes too clean ) . however , the chashu pork here is absolutely amazing , with the texture and flavor spot on . easily the best chashu pork i ' ve ever had . overall , the great service ( didn ' t feel rushed like most other ramen joints ) and the good food at a good value earns my recommendation if you ' re in the area ! i ' d definitely order extra chashu and try the gyoza next time . 
old school . . good food . can ' t miss
while i can definitely appreciate the use of fresh local produce , i also appreciate the use of salt and pepper . apparently these cooks do not . they provide you with ample salt and pepper at the table , and for good reason , because the food is severely lacking in flavor . fresh , local produce does not a good cook make . i could have gone around the corner to union market and prepared a better dish myself . i had the worst meze i have experienced in life - it tasted like bad baby food . apparently raw cuisine is key word for lazy . this is the kind of food that makes americans think that healthy nasty . two thumbs down . 
everything was delicious . . . . the fried chicken and wings , macaroni cheese , greens , cornbread , cobbler and sweet potatoes . yummy ! ! ! the portions are gigantic and everyone is very friendly . we love the food at cast iron soul and look forward trying some new things . . . . i ' ve got my eye on another type of wing and catfish and steve is thinking more of the same . . his faves . . . chicken and macaroni . 
atticus is a new haven classic . it has a great environment , excellent home-made soups , breads ( breads ! ! ) , sandwiches , and desserts , and a nice independent bookstore with a helpful and knowledgeable staff . bookstore employees have done a great job of recommending books for my son . he feels welcome and comfortable there and loves stopping by when we ' re downtown . new haven would not be new haven without atticus . oh , and their black bean soup is wonderful ! 
i was encouraged by the rave reviews on yelp , but i was extremely disappointed . . . not sure if three out of four of us just managed to order horribly wrong , or if everyone else is crazy . anyway , the service was good - the waitress was very nice . she did , however , steer me in a bad direction when she recommended i order some kind of rolled meat with cheese inside . the mashed potatoes were the saving grace . my boyfriend had this potato pancake dish that was sour and just bad . usually he ' s able to stomach just about anything and will try to eat as much as possible just to be polite , but he didn ' t even bother this time - he couldn ' t . it was that bad . my friend ordered a salad with steak - the pears were gigantic but not in a good way because they just weren ' t cut in an appropriate size for eating . her husband ' s meal looked good but was basic , just a steak with fries . all in all , i do not recommend this restaurant unless you are maybe wanting a steak and have no other options . 
 name ? 
i tried the prix-fixe lunch last week with my wife , and was very glad we did . appetizer ( soup ) , main course ( fried chicken ) and dessert ( carrot cake ) were all amazingly tasty . at N for the lunch , it seems like a great deal , considering the quality and level of the food . this place reminds me of market restaurant that used to be in montclair , back when it was still in the diner and was taking real care in making the food ( and before it moved and went slightly downhill before closing shop ) . very glad it ' s here , and can ' t wait to try it again . service and atmosphere seemed just right to us ( nice , casual feel ) , but there were only a few tables seated so we didn ' t want for attention . i ' m told they have a children ' s menu , so we may try bringing the kid next time to see what she thinks . a lot of the restaurants on bloomfield ave in montclair leave something to be desired , but this one met all my expectations . 
i was worried about trying carmines , as i heard they were always packed and pretty popular . well , it lives up to its name . the family style dishes are huge - like they seriously will serve a family of N or more . and everything i have tasted here so far is fantastic . the staff is fine , nothing to write home about . the bar is fine . the food is awesome and worth checking it out . make reservations in advance ( we ' ve waited over an hour at peak times ) and bring your appetite ! ! 
dirty ! ! filthy ! ! people don ' t understand english ! we have N . N worth of disgusting subs in our refrigerator which was their mistake . we order capacola and provolone with lettuce , tomato , vinegar peppers . we get thick slices of ham , some kind of smushy salami , capacola ( slime-y ) , cheese , and about N N cup of mayo on each piece of bread . they stopped answering their phone N minutes before they close so there was no way to tell them about the mistake . call the next day and the owner starts screaming then hangs up ! ! ! you want a sub ? go to someplace else . pizza and is open later but you have to be hard pressed to eat there . 
after searching for places to satisfy my bbq craving , decided to give this spot a try , based on the number of reviews and how highly it ' s rated . walked into a cozy space with semi dim lighting . the line was about N people deep but didn ' t wait more than Nmin . went with the bbq brisket sandwich ( with bread ) , a small side of burnt end baked beans , and a small side of sweet potato casserole . the workers were friendly and very helpful with recommendations . i split this order with a friend and it was filling for both of us . the brisket is cooked perfectly ! literally melts when you bite it . the baked beans with burnt ends is amazing . i ' m not normally a fan of beans but if they always tasted like this , i ' m sure i would be . the casserole was great as well . with pieces of pecan , the texture was nice . all three complemented each other really well . a filling meal for two in new york for only N ? not bad at all . i ' m originally from cali and i ' d definitely prefer this over phils ' . yep , i said it ! would love to come back ! 
excellent red sangria . the white , not so good . try the shrimp , bacon and avocado arepa ( la fresquita ) . the octopus one and the veggie are excellent too . stay away from the greasy empanadas . very friendly dominican waitress . 
decline and fall when the south side of williamsburg was still terra incognito this place was an outpost of quality . hipster creep has since caught up with south williamsburg ( despite the efforts of the orthodox hassidic community to keep the ' artists ' on the other side of broadway ) . it is now way overblown and the last two times we ' ve been there they can ' t seem to even do the simple things right any longer . last week i ordered one of their mainstays , the egg and cheese on a biscuit . after a twenty five minute wait it finally arrived . unfortunately it was not worth the wait . the egg cheese portion of the formula was salty to the point of wondering if the cap on the salt shaker had fallen off during preparation . the poached egg breakfast entre was ok , although sometimes the combinations of what you find under the eggs are quite inedible . for our money the best breakfast in williamsburg is actually in greenpoint at le gamin . 
so you know when you find something incredibly good on a menu at a certain place and you keep getting that one thing without trying anything else ? well , i ' ve been doing that here . the vegan chicken cheese steak ( with everything ) -so so good . last time i was in i did add the yellow split pea soup to my order last time since it was so chilly out and it was also deliciously yummy . staff is always friendly and work quickly to get orders out . i always seem to rolling out of this place , especially when i get desert ! so incredibly good . i could eat here everyday . 
food is delicious . . . not the prettiest place . . . but good eats
my employer always raves about this place , and he finally took me here for a business dinner . we arrived late for our reservation , but we were still greeted warmly and seated immediately . our server was very prompt and knowledgeable of the menu and specials . i started with the beet salad , while my companion had the lemongrass soup , both delicious . for entrees , we had the salmon and the nightly special , veal wienerschintzel . both were very tasty , prepared and seasoned perfectly all in all , ambiance was excellent , service was great , food very good . the only reason i am not giving five stars is because i think the menu could or should have some more options or edge . would return or recommend for a lovely dining experience . 
best pasta in town ! 
normally there is a huge wait . . . we got lucky and walked right in to the open minibar table by the front window ! considering the volume of customers , the service was speedy , and the chefs made a considerable effort to the plating of everything that left the kitchen ! we ordered one special brunch item and a tried true lunch staple . . . round one mandarin orange jigger ( ginger cane sugar orange fizzy soda ) and a fully ny state rootbeer float ( ithaca soda and brooklyn ice cream ! ) round two heaven in our mouths . . . . otherwise known as sugar cured bacon . round three jalape o chorizo eggs benedict ( the special ) and fried chicken , vanilla waffle with signature maple butter sauce ! great points about this place true foodie fun , bright airy atmosphere , think country kitchen friendly meets urban city nook , the perfect sunday brunch regardless of the week day . . . downside be prepared to wait , cash only , better suited to small parties and not super kid proof ! 
the restaurant is lovely . the bar has wonderful charm and is immaculate . we have sat at the bar about N times and haven ' t been back now for well over a year . this is a husband and wife owned business . the wife is the executive chef and the husband holds court over the bar . the husband and his sidekick bartenders are what we call " the bar nazis " who we find extremely strange and boorish . we have never seen anything like it . if one does not order their drink exactly as the recipe calls for you will be told about it . we have never sat at any bar and been lectured and drilled about the rules of the bar and the rules of making cocktails . we were speaking with a woman who was also seated at the bar and she told us they had actually refused to make her cocktail because she deviated from the original recipe . unbelievable . we are fairly knowledgeable about wine , but certainly are not familiar with every vineyard on the planet . we found that we couldn ' t even ask a question of the bartenders regarding wines listed without again , a lecture . the strangeness on the part of the bartenders took away from what could have been a wonderful experience as far as the cuisine . the wife should send the husband and his sidekicks over to the four seasons for training on how to act and how to treat customers . for that fact , they could be sent over to a number of bar taverns in the city , who i suspect they would never set foot in , who have the most wonderful bartenders . actually , they could start their training with the bartenders at for pete ' s sake who are outstanding . people go out to have conversation , not to be lectured . it makes no sense to aggravate and insult the customers when a large part of your pay comes from tips . 
the service and food where outstanding from the calamari to the chocolate cake . also the bubbling berries drink was good and exciting to see it bubble . 
i ' ve been going there for more than N years . i ' ve always wondered what the big deal was . perhaps if the employees would make you feel more welcome and realize that we the consumers put the food on their tables , they might have more business . i guess when you own the property and have built a reputation on a myth , you don ' t have to worry about repeat business . never mind going inside to sit , where they look at you as if you interrupted their slumber . this dive passes itself for a dump with no respect for sanitation and health concerns and it does a very good job at it . bulldoze it , fire the entire staff and start from scratch . 
great
my date and i arrived on a whim out of nostalgia for dinners with my family as a child . the outside is inviting as are the staff at the ordering welcoming kiosk . unfortunately that ' s about where the pleasantries stopped . the salad bar area they had what would be a good selection if it weren ' t for the hot options . all over cooked , old or both . and then the deliciously anticipated beef we ordered arrived at the table . i thought we were being punk ' d . what arrived on the plate was nothing short of a slab of cadaver flesh with grill marks brushed on . by sight and taste u can tell these are steamed or boiled and then if lucky , thrown onto an actual grill . the garlic bread was the same frozen and baked product i remember as a kid . the side of mushrooms and onions came in a pool of oil and grease . the one saving grace on the plate were the sweet potato fries . i ' d rather not write a bad review because eventually too many and it may drive those businesses out of business and aide in the growth of those unemployed . but when u have stiff steak competition down the street u have to step up your game . not drop the ball . score american steakhouse - N . any fast food competitor score ! ! 
does everyone in ct have a sweet tooth ? i just moved here a year ago , and have had a devil of a time finding thai food that is not too sweet . pad thai , for example , should be a blend of salty , sweet , sour and hot . while rice pot is an improvement from other new haven ( cheap ) thai spots i ' ve tried , in part because they aren ' t afraid to use a little chili , some of the dishes were almost cloyingly sweet . my husband and kids loved it- great service , ambience , and good food , but i ' ll stick to the spicier curry dishes that are less sweet . 
hands down N pizza ( tied with l b ' s ) in the world . i say " world " because new york has the best pizza in the world and i ' ve tried pizza everywhere ! come here when you have time and have a plan b just in case they ' re closed or making new bread . the man himself is going to take his time and cook with a lot of heart and care . don ' t order slices- better off getting a pie because it ' s way cheaper in the end and fresh out the oven . someone was complaining about board of health issues , etc . . . this is an old school hole in the wall joint ! think of it as going to your gramps crib for some good authentic cooking . . . 
i couldn ' t ask for much more . i came here last week , and even though the prices on the menu are on the high side , i think it ' s worth it . the pizza ' s , pastas , and appetizers we had were all delicious , and an extra star for a good selection of wine . 
love the little owl , great food , ambiance , highly recommend , great date night ! 
worst sushi i ' ve ever had . as others mentioned this isn ' t your average sushi , this is sushi made by someone who would clearly identify as a " foodie . " that said , the excessive ingredients proved detrimental to the sushi rather than making it better and more exciting . the sushi was hearty , wrapped in seemingly N types of rice and grain and all kinds of random stuff . i could barely get through one serving . also , the menu is a tedious read , it ' s like a j . peterman catalog , way too many pages and all the items have a silly little story attached to them . just tell me whats in it ! super slow service . would not eat here again . yuck ! 
i stop by on a sunday nite and the mg very attentive tools us to a nice both ( and we didn ' t have a rsvp ) . so nice of him ! ! ! plus it was before N pm so the waitress let us enjoy the happy hour menu ! ! ! ! it was one of the bests service we had ! ! ! tacos enchapulinados and the negrony . total recommend it ! ! ! i ' ll be back for brunch ! ! ! 
tried a range of tapas . . . pan tumaca , churrasco arriero , croquetas de jamon , empanadillas de carne , pimientos de piquillo rellenos . . . . they were ok , but nothing that i ' m craving to have again . red wine sangria was ok , not awesome . 
as a native new yorker , i am so disappointed by this attitude of the entitlement that some new yorkers may have . it really exhibits poor grace , and we live in such a phenomenal city where we have so many cultures . we are lucky to have the tourists that builds this city ' s economy . . . these immature and unreasonable opinions clearly displays that you do not travel and are not well rounded . also , the fact that balthazar cares for the well -being of their guests , it shows lots of class ! ! ! ! there are so many places that can care less about people and repercussions can happen . . . . just look at the news ! 
if you are ever stuck in traffic trying to get on the bqe at hamilton avenue , or if you have ever just had a particularly painful shopping experience due to poor customer service at home depot or loews on hamilton avenue ( as if the work that you plan to do with your purchases isn ' t punishment enough ) , and you begin to think that hamilton avenue is truly hell on earth , where all hellish traffic and shopping experiences await you . . . just drive N minutes and reward yourself with the best lobster roll in brooklyn . you will be confused how such a place of deliciousness and freshness can exist in such a barren wasteland of industrialism , but it does and you shouldn ' t miss it . reward yourself goddamn-it ! why rush home to paint or scrape the fence ? ? order a maine style lobster role and enjoy the big chunks of lobster , with just the small right amount of mayo on a buttery roll , sit on the picnic benches and pretend you ' re in maine by the beach . you deserve it , enjoy ! your sanity is worth N . fyi - there is no public restroom so if you were just stuck in traffic on the bqe , stop at the mcdonald ' s first . 
while i enjoyed the taste of the banh mi the bread here is all wrong . it tasted like a hoagie roll and not a flaky baguette . i want a banh mi that has a lot of texture to it . the whole thing was just very soft . few veggies with very little spice and with really really sweet pork . i ' m told that this is the more popular style of banh mi in nyc as opposed to northern va where the popular choice is a combination of cold cuts with mayo and pate . i definitely prefer the latter . i ' m not sure of suitable alternatives in the area , but for the money banh mi saigon will make an acceptable sandwich , just maybe not the best . 
great food but way too much going on here . we tried a few of their dumplings , steamed and soup . also had the scallion pancakes . these dishes were all delicious and worth the N minute wait . and that N mins is short compared to their usual wait . the problem is that you share tables with random people and are seated super close to them and the servers are working very fast to get you in and out . i love good and efficient service , but i ' m not a fan of being rushed . come for the food but be warned . i will probably be back . 
the fan sports bar is closed again . . . that ' s freakin sucks because that was the hot spot of tuesdays , and the weekends . beer was always good there and the food too . i wonder why they closed . . ? they been closed for a minute now . i actually drove by a few times . . it looks like they ' re closed permently , jeeze ! everyN was always so nice there ! the Nst time i heard rumors about the place , now these people ! . . . that place sounds cursed ! lol has anyone heard anything about this resturant ? 
the burgers here are not what they use to be . they taste frozen like any regular hamburger joint , and are not worth the ten dollar price tag anymore . customer service is horrible as well . the cashier caught an attitude when i asked her about replacing a burger i had ordered medium rare that arrived well done . got the replacement burger which arrived again well done again . i guess the chef was teaching me a lesson for complaining about the first burger . did not even dare to ask for another replacement . they also dumped my fries from the first burger i turned in and refused to give me another set . will not return here ever again . shitty service and shitty burger for ten dollars , not my idea of money well spent . 
amazing pizza
cheap , filling , and delicious . i had the pulled pork banh mi ( N ) , and it was ready in less than N minutes , no joke . i will be back here soon , and often . 
luckily , my experience at hearth was nothing less than a number of pleasant first impressions . some full disclosure - i ' ve been to hearth about four times already , and each time i ' ve been impressed with the food . i ' ve also been impressed with the extremely friendly and knowledgeable bartender , kelly ( i met her the last time i was there , and she ' s definitely a bartender i ' d want to share more food and drinks with ) . but i think this just set the bar super high when i decided to go there to try their famous chicken soup with farro and dumplings . . . read my entire review on my blog ! bit . ly aNkuyw
ippudo has finally come to mid town ! and there ' s no line ! ! N-hour totto waiting is now officially ended
the food here is some of the best being made in all of the brooklyn scene . the attentions to small details when plating , the mixture of texture , the willingness to pull from a variety of world palates to create unique fresh food with a seasonal focus and un-fussy feel are all commendable . the only thing that brings it down a bit for me is the level of pretense displayed by the bartender . it was really intense . i like the drinks , but dude , it ' s drinks not brain surgery . i wanted a decent bourbon with just a bit of ice . they had a really limited selection , and the hand cracked ice made it watery immediately . i just wanted a cube , the bartender seemed to think they knew better than me how i should drink my drink . 
the only diner i know to offer eggs benedict with crabmeat . really out of this world . and their waffles with strawberries and whipped cream ain ' t so bad either . milt and mike , the owners , are the nicest guys who really care for their customers . 
i came here tonight and i absolutely loved the whole experience ! inside it is all rustic , but sophisticated . the bartender was awesome . they played all classic motown , the stones , elvis ! i had the black white tagliatelle . . . homemade pasta , seafood . . . heaven ! cannot go wrong . the pasta was al dente , the seafood was cooked perfectly , the tomato sauce tasted like it was made from fresh tomatos . . . one of my friends got the same as me , the other got one of the specials which was a squash ravioli in duck confit ( i think ? ) . . . i gotta tell you , i had some and i was a little jealous . it was absolutely perfect -- a little sweet , but you could taste the duck fat and the savoury flavours blended perfectly with the sweet squash . we shared a pizza fresca . fresh mozzarella basil . again , fresh home made tomato sauce in the base . i love the traditional thin crust , wood fired pizza , i can ' t wait to come back and try some others . the wine was divine . should have ordered a bottle . i love places like this that serve great food , a lot of warmth and character , and can also pull of elegance without being pretentious . loved it . will be back again . 
went last night with friends from overseas . impeccable family style restaurant made a great impression at reasonable prices right in times square . highly recommend and will definitely be coming again . 
don ' t waste your money and time . this place is not worth it . have tried it twice and both times had a bad experience with both the food quality and service . there are many other s . indian places in north bruswick , franklin park that are better than this . 
i love this place too and all the food was delicious . it was definitely the highlight of my food adventures in nyc . they have all kinds of sake and the service was great . the best part about nyc is that even though we were extremely tipsy , we didn ' t have to drive home . just hopped on the subway . woohoo ! 
we sat at the bar - as we had the opportunity to find this place within the first week of them opening , they were slammed - and having a table with a grill wasn ' t an option without a reservation . i had been to one of their nyc locations though , and having liked what they do up there , felt like this would be great addition to the fairmont restaurant scene - it definitely is . however , that said , they are still perfecting things along the way - which their staff is quick to observe and correct . for instance , my friend ordered a rice based dish which at first came out a little cooler than it should have - but this wasn ' t based on their observation , but instead was the bar tender ' s and he proactively asked for a replacement entree and served that N minutes later acknowledging the first attempt wasn ' t spot on . i had a mix of appetizers as my dinner and enjoyed most of them - wings , salmon steamed shrimp dumplings . however , the volcano seafood appetizer was lacking in flavor and could ' ve been skipped . probably worth a shot going back for the bbq - but wish they were more choice-ful in the appetizers they ' re selling . 
super nice staff and the food was good , but it took forever until we got our order . 
visited with a work colleague a few weeks back ! if your looking for ambiance or great service , you wouldnt come here . . but the pho-od ! rare beef pho with all the trimmings was awesome with a spicy zinfandel ( yes , its byob ) . everything authentic , only english speakers in place . this detracted from our service since the waiter maitre ' d was chatting up the native customers . definitely a return visit ! 
i sat at the bar and had an appetizer ( grilled sardines ) and a main course ( a vegetable tagine or stew ) that were served piping hot and were eye-opening delicious . the spacious restaurant ' s decor is particularly handsome and was a welcome relief from the hot , crowded street . the only phoned-in thing was the bartenders , who seemed efficient enough , but lacked any apparent interest in engaging with the customers over the drinks or food . 
my husband and i eat dinner often at the restaurants bar since we rarely make advance reservations . we walked out of maialino last night after the " service " bartender poured half a glass pours for two martinis up and less than a N oz pour of wine and didn ' t even take our full order before walking away and taking care of another customer . there is nothing worse to a bar customer than to get half a drink . charge more and pour a N-N ounce glass of wine and a full martini . never even tasted the food and i wouldn ' t ever return . 
how did i not write a review about this place yet ? they have the best steak in all of nyc and i ' ve been to the usual suspects ( peter lugers , sparks , etc ) . the skirt steak with the chimichurri on the side sea salt , plus the mashed potatoes sprinkled with amazingness are soo good and if memory serves me correctly , only N . the avocado fries for appetizer are a must . they are always crunchy on the outside ( yay panko ! ) and smooth and creamy on the inside . the spicy ketchup-like dipping sauce is amazing . i ' ve also tried their fish tacos , calamari , side salad , rib eye , stuffed pepper and flan . all are soo good . you really can ' t go wrong with anything on the menu . when i can , i grab a seat at the bar , because table seating can be tight . there is also one waitress there that can be a little bitchy , but i ' m totally overlooking that because no amount of rudeness could keep me away from the amazing steaks ! ! also , as in other reviews . cash only
had a nice dinner planned with family on friday night - heard so much about the jazz night . went and was completely disappointed in the food and the service . the jazz was great but it stopped really early - it appeared as if management cut it short for some reason - needless to say we were extremely unhappy - if you ' re going to advertise live music , make sure you provide it ! 
meh . the service was not good , the food was slow and mediocre . i was in a table of two and felt like we were our waiter ' s afterthought , maybe larger tables get better service . i had the pulled pork entree , which wasn ' t anything special and it arrived rather cold and was served on a bed of mashed potatoes that tasted pretty insipid , think high school cafeteria potatoes . . . . the didn ' t add up either , aside from the nice N bottle wine list , i think this restaurant deserves another to its price range . i think it ' s definitely pricier than the description . . . the ambience was pretty lovely however . . . overall , i was disappointed and would not return . i don ' t relate to the stellar reviews here at all . 
while bobby flay isn ' t a personality i hold in the highest esteem N , there ' s no denying the fact that his latest opening has drawn in anything less than a barrage of positive reviews . after several months went by and the outlook only seemed to grow brighter , i finally gave in and made a dinner reservation at gato . naming conventions aside N , i had yet to find another spanish restaurant that could rival the caliber of casa mono , so i was hopeful when i arrived for dinner on an early friday evening . a rectangular bar area is juxtaposed next to the main dining room , and indeed , several peeks into the kitchen verified the fact that flay himself was behind the line . to begin the meal , we started with a trio of bar snacks . the lamb tenderloin was a modest starting bite , a somewhat bland pairing of rare lamb against a mild salsa verde . better received was the eleven layer potato , a cube of layered potato , caramelized shallots , and a crisp leaf of fried sage on top , as well as the eggplant manchego , which ingeniously paired silken eggplant with a creamy manchego , a tart balsamic , and oregano . to share , we also opted for the crab risotto , cooked to the perfect consistency , although a bit sparse on the crab . the use of the calabrian red chile was a smart touch , tinting the dish a firey red , and the generous amount of terragon added a noticeable edge to each spoonful . it was in the main courses that the dishes started to take a turn . the favorite of the following was probably the porterhouse pork chop , a well-seared cut of pork that was paired with a romesco-infused polenta and highlighted even further by the red wine and tomato pan juices . the charred beef was puzzling in flavor profile , combining strip-steak medallions against vandeon blue cheese , although the broccoli rabe and farro were a nice touch . the disappointment had to be in the kale and wild mushroom paella although impressively presented in an iron skillet , there was hardly any of the flavorful , crispy socarrat to be found . the flavor of each bite was one-dimensional and monotonous despite the presence of a poached egg in the center , the kale overtaking all other ingredients , and the artichokes were sliced in portions too unwieldy to comfortably chew . desserts are similarly a mixed bag . the tarte tatin is pleasant at first bite , the vanilla-black pepper gelato a unique offering compared to the traditional gelato flavors . the salted calvados caramel sauce on top soon becomes too cloying after a few more spoonfuls , however . and the meyer lemon tart appears impressive at first glance , but breaking into the outer shell reveals a filling that lacks any viscosity , a runny mess of meyer lemon that spills over the plate . and no , the complimentary biscotti and glasses of sherry at the end can ' t remediate the disappointment of the earlier plates . i ' m not sure what happened with our meal here did the numerous critics get served completely different plates than what we recieved ? or is my judgment of spanish and mediterranean cuisine completely flawed ? regardless , i am glad my curiosity , at the very least , was sated , but gato will not be one of my recommendations for potential diners . -- N my earliest memory of bobby flay was at the opening of bobby ' s burger palace at upenn in philadelphia , where he refused to acknowledge any of the students that tried to greet him . the burgers are , unsurprisingly , pretty lackluster . N gato is spanish for " cat " , perhaps a testament to flay ' s multiple lives . 
great spot near world trade center museum . great food . excellent service ! 
the best tasting menu deal in nyc period . excellent food and value . mezcal cocktails are also great . 
i ordered the classic spaghetti and meatballs . . . . . . . . . . . . . i wasn ' t blown away . . . the service was good , until the end . . . where i asked for the check like N times . . . a bit disappointing . 
maybe it was the day i decided to try pure fare or perhaps it was the hour at which i came , but i was not impressed with this place . i visited around Npm to grab a late take-out lunch . i had heard that there were pre-boxed items for purchase , which is exactly what i needed . when i walked into pure fare , most of the items had been sold - with the except of a few salads and some yogurt . i selected a kale salad with apples and bought a slice of their quinoa skillet bread and a cup of asparagus soup that were on display at the register . i only ended up eating the quinoa skillet bread and asparagus soup for lunch and saved the kale salad for dinner . the asparagus soup was super bland and to make matters worse , there were thin pieces of woody asparagus that had not successfully made it through the blender - not a nice surprise when you ' re expecting a homogenous puree . with the quantity of salt that i had to add to the soup to make it edible , i essentially bypassed their " healthy food " mantra . ( my blood pressure gladly took one for the team . ) the quinoa skillet bread is the reason why there are even two stars in this review . that shit was delicious . i honestly can ' t believe it ' s healthy . the kale salad was a big disappointment too . there was a minimal amount of dressing on the salad so i had to add a bit of my own to the dish to keep from having to choke down the kale . i can ' t say that the apples or chunks of chicken and cheese heightened this salad to any cosmic levels . it was just a tasteless fancy-sounding salad . i ' ll try this place again at some point because i need to see if i just came at a bad time on a bad day . 
my second time being here after my previous attempt to use my living social deal was turned down due to me not notifying the waitress beforehand . since the food is N stars , i decided to come back and finally redeem it . i ordered a coconut margarita on the rocks ( which i recommend along with the guava ) , a shrimp taco and two fried squid tacos , which were absolutely delectable . the food and drinks are a N while the service is a N . my sister ordered sour cream with her tacos and we did not receive it when the food came . not to mention , the server bringing out the food went to every table thinking it was their order until she finally figured we were the only ones left and came to us last . this place needs to get it together . the food and happy hour specials are great but their service is poor . 
i don ' t think harry ' s needs another review saying how awesome they are , so i ' ll keep this brief . they ' re awesome . love the flavor of the crust , just thin enough but sturdy enough to stand up to whatever toppings you want to put on it . toppings themselves are high quality , sauce and cheese are . . . well . . . awesome . only thing that ' s not awesome ? the price . you ' re absolutely paying for premium here . i got three large two topping pizzas for takeout . N bones . whoa . i ' m willing to pay for quality , just wish i could afford it . 
high expectations after reading the reviews here but . . . . went without a reservation on a wednesday evening and got seated in an elbow to elbow table not fit for european cloister phobics . after pleading , got our wish to be moved to the open table in front of the open window . ahhh . ordered wine - a bottle they also sell by the glass- a pino blanc from alsace and requested to have a taste before making the N decision ( one of the more bottom end priced bottles ) . not possible , the handsome , french accented waiter said . i stupidly accepted then he brought the bottle , opened it and proceeded to pour two full glasses - half the bottle without letting us taste it . it turned out to be luke warm and slightly sweet . when i remarked about this , he retrieved an ice bucket noting awkwardly it would get colder soon . it turned out the guy was in training , first day on the job . but that shouldn ' t be our problem . the more competent waitress who took over explained this to us and apologized , at least . but that was it . we ordered the mussels and clams as an app- our impression was they were slightly overlooked . the broth had flavor but was over salty . i had the saut ed halibut in lemon sauce- fresh tasting , nicely done - best with the good ratatouille we ordered as a side . the fries were not worth the N price or the calories- fat and mealy and tasteless despite the spice layer . husband ordered the steak which was perfectly fine . the best part of the meal was the warm mini baguettes with butter ! 
we were roti neophytes but after our first visit we were hooked . roy ' s guidance and friendly nature add to the experience of devouring boneless chicken roti ( with chana ) , doubles ( to die for ) , washed down with sorrel or peardrax . everything is fresh and clearly made with love . there are only a few tables and mostly a takeout crowd but we always stay and talk with roy . 
we had a rather terrible lunch here , but my husband and guests loved the chocolate cheesecake , raspberry coconut , and lemon curd " gooey bar " cake we were given as consolation prizes . the setting is cute and everyone in the restaurant was pleasant . the crowd was older folks , many retired , some about to reach there . i was with my N month old in a carrier and nearly N year old in a high chair . we were seated immediately , then waited . and waited . we got the bread basket and ordered medium rare steak for my daughter , mediterranean platter--a cold dish--for me . a single person sat in the table next to ours . she got her bread and butter . then after water , ordered . a table on the patio was seated . they ordered . the patio got their food . the single person got their food . we were waiting . amazingly , the kids were quiet for the first N minutes , enjoying the brioche and butter . lots of butter . they got bored of the bread and butter . i was annoyed that we were still waiting . eventually , i flagged down our waiter to ask if there was a problem with our meal--he decided to check on it ( same water as for the single person next to us , enjoying her crab cake sandwich ) . waiting , but we had more water . kids starting to lose it . food brought out . the steak was medium well . grey . when the server was nearby , i let him know that the steak was not medium rare , but we didn ' t have time to send it back due to a watershed commitment . my daughter ate the olives from my plate . the steak knife , given to my toddler , i used to saw through the steak . she liked the asparagus , and my olives . i did ask to see the manager . he apologised that they had no control over the timing--they wanted the steak to come out at the same time as the cold platter . i let him know that that was great , but that it didn ' t make sense that a ) N other tables seated ordered after us were served before us and b ) medium rare is not medium well , N ) a medium rare steak does not take half an hour to cook . i apologised that my kids got agitated ( loud ) for the middle section of our time there ( they were calm when i spoke to the manager ) , but seriously , don ' t serve tables out of order , particularly when it is so obvious . i asked that they teach the kitchen how to cook a steak . it ' s honestly not that difficult to get a cold platter and a steak out at the same time--that ' s kitchen N . i hated the babaganous , which was a very thin , unappetizing puree . my infant liked the hummus . the feta was good . the marinated peppers too tarte for my liking my daughter loved them . the toast was tasty . the bacon was pre-cooked in tiny little strips , cold , obviously prepared in advance . they offered to take off the steak , i said no , i ' ll pay for it , as my infant enjoyed it . the bill had mr next to the steak order . grey , with only a hint of pink , isn ' t medium rare . we do want to return , as it is a cute place and i ' d like to give them a second chance . i like the paint used on the walls , and would like to show it to jim so see if he agrees that it would be great for our bedroom . my guests , last night , loved the desserts . the experience reminded me of a recent conversation during which everyone crapped on princeton restaurants and extolled the virtues of restaurants in every other town--where every restaurant is good . to the N of the N restaurants in rocky hill i ' ve been to , sure . to the ones i ' ve been to in hopewell ? i can ' t say i ' ve been blown over by even one of them . N including tax tip for lunch . 
pio pio brings to mind countless tasty and fun meals with groups of friends . ny mag was right on to include this peruvian gem on its cheap eats list ( see nymag . com listings resta ) you can get a satisfying meal for four on the cheap if you stick to the chicken pio ( whole rotisserie chicken -- pio pio ' s famous dish -- for N ) and a couple of sides . in general , pio pio is a great place to share a family-style meal ( by default they serve individual entrees ) . i prefer family-style dining here because there is so many entrees to sample , all of which go well with the magical green sauce , which is spicy , savory , and tart . some highlights ( N ) matador combo an entire rotisserie chicken ( tender and delicious ) , rice and beans , fried tostones , avocado salad , and a huge mound of fries topped with sliced ( fried ) hot dogs . if you ' re more interested in the chicken , skip the combo and get the chicken pio , which is plenty of food . ( N ) parihuela fish shellfish stew cooked with rocoto hot peppers and peruvian beer . ( N ) jalea a large mound of assorted fried seafood , including calamari , shrimp , and fish ( N for the regular N for the larger side ) topped with an onion and tomato lime sauce . ( N ) fish entrees the corvina and chilean sea bass are tender and flavorful the salmon is only average , however . ( N ) desserts the flan and tres leches are satisfyingly sweet without weighing you down . i don ' t recommend the peruvian chinese dishes ( arroz chaufa lomo saltado -- the meat is a bit overcooked and soy sauce is the main flavoring ) . i do recommend the sangria , however it ' s got just the right amount of kick to complement its fruity goodness . you may have gathered that much of the food is heavy and oily , but the fish entrees offer good options for health conscious diners . pio pio takes reservations and has a large table that can accommodate about ten people . call a couple of days ahead and you should be good to go . 
hands down the only pizza place on the planet that can compare to the holy trinity in new haven ( sally ' s , modern , pepe ' s ) . first off , they have a real brick oven ( not a metal oven lined with bricks ) . secondly , one of the owners was a longtime cook at modern so he knows how to make perfect pies . thirdly , they are not afraid to cook the pies they way they ' re supposed to be cooked well done . i am a firm believer that if my hands are not black after eating a pie , then i didn ' t really have pizza . beautifully blackened around the edges , perfectly cooked , these pies are mini culinary masterworks . and one note to pizza eaters order small pies . always . there isn ' t a pizza joint in the world that can make a perfect large pizza . every connoisseur i know orders only smalls , otherwise you have no right to complain . just saying , you might thing you know pizza , but if i see you eating a large , i know you haven ' t a clue . 
very happy with our experience at tessera ! we had a baby shower here this past weekend and everything was great . the staff was extremely helpful and accommodated our every need . i ' m very picky want everything perfect and our over-the-top celebration turned out wonderful . the food was excellent which is usually hard to find when having a large party . we had chicken parm , penne vodka , marinated steak , and tilapia , all large portions . they allowed us to decorate the way we wanted . in a lot of the reviews i have read , people seem to think it caters more to an older crowd . i understand why they think that but we were a mixed age group and everyone loved it . the staff , especially mustafa , melissa , john , another waiter we had , were awesome . they were very helpful and anytime i asked for something they did it right away . would absolutely have another party in their private room again ! reasonable pricing , delicious food , very friendly helpful staff . thanks tessera for helping to make the shower perfect ! 
great food great family a winning combination
love the double cooked pork and the dry pepper chicken . thing to caution they ' re very generous on the salt , i always tell them no salt , and it comes out just right
casual girls ' night out - this place was the perfect spot for it . nice ambiance , good food , and great service . we had a reservation for two at N N on tuesday night . i ran N mins late but checked in right away at the front . my friend was N minutes late and i was starting to get worried about our table . . . did they still have it saved for us ? yes , they did and they sat us right away ! - so that was a great start . the waitress was very attentive and super nice accommodating . when she heard that we ' d be splitting the entrees she offered to bring them already split in half . when she heard we were deciding on what beers to get she got us little tasters . she gave us great recommendations on the menu and overall the service continued to be great throughout our meal . food was also surprisingly very tasty . we split the akaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos ( N ) and kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs ( N ) . the jalapenos in the cheeseburger gave it a little spicy punch at the end ( but the spiciness wasn ' t overwhelming , which was great ) . in contrast , the pasta had more of a mellow taste to it . both of the dishes were fantastic ! we also ordered two desserts almond cake ( N ) and sundae ( N ) . the almond cake was very light . . . or maybe we thought so because the sundae was very sweet with a strong caramel flavor . out of the two , i ' d say my favorite was the sundae which had salted caramel ice cream , candied peanuts popcorn , whipped cream , and chocolate sauce . split this with your friend if you can ! overall , i will definitely come back ! 
food was tasteless . service inattentive . overpriced . 
this place is located near all the museums . gf and i were visiting the met and wanted to find a bite to eat where we could sit down close by . found this place on yelp , and noticed all of the great reviews . there are actually two restaurants in the neue galarie museum which offer the same menu . the one upstairs had a longer line , so we opted to eat in the basement restaurant . we had about a N minute wait until we were seated . the menu is short and to the point . gf and i opted to split the bratwurst and the open faced salmon sandwich . both were delicious , standard austrian fare . i had a N N bottle of austrian wine which i can ' t remember the name of ( writer fail ) . service was ok . they took our order , brought our food , and then brought us the bill . at no point in time did anyone ask how we were doing , or if we wanted anything else . if you ' re looking for traditional german austrian food then this is a good place to go . 
so a block away from my house i realized i did not have my keys on me . i freaked out . i searched high and low on my person , in my bag to no avail . finally i decided to give my roomie a call who also happens to work with me . he was able to find them at my desk . thank god . however , it would take him a little while to get home . i decided to go for a walk and find a drink . as i was walking about i passed by several bars , first of which was not open . the second was too rustic for the mood i was in . the third , well i just didnt like the third . finally i found myself in front of le barricou . i stood out front checking out the take out menu wondering if there were any happy hour specials and decided to take the plunge . pushed the door to get in ( usually you pull , right ? ) i know . im weird i notice these things . and as soon as i got in . . . well i realized that it was the right choice . it had the right feel . plus i have an affinity for most things french . went ahead and hopped on the bar . an older woman came almost immediately filled a bottle of water , set me a glass and a small dish of olives . i took a look at the wine menu . and im new to this wine thing but i love it . the list looked pretty extensive , however , they only had three by the glass . i ended up going with a carafe of the red spanish wine which name i forget . it was a bit dark for my taste . earthy . i prefer my wine a bit sweeter and lighter . but after i was done with the first glass and my palette had adjusted , i enjoyed it . i talked with the guy that served my wine and found out he was the owner . real nice guy . got a little bit of his background and found out what his place is all about . not going to share with you but im sure if you go there and ask he ' d tell you . all the staff was very friendly . they almost forgot my change which i asked them to break , but its okay . they were nice and that means more to me than being forgetful . the decor , atmosphere and music was certainly something that i liked . lounge , un-presumptuous , not over bearing . the little glasses at the bar with fresh sunflowers and candles made me happy while drinking wine and eating olives . the wine lounge in the back was cute with the little piano back there . i definately want to make it back for food and am also happy that they deliver . might return to this entry to write more once i ' ve eaten . four stars for being a place i want to go back to after only a carafe of wine and some olives . 
can ' t say enough good things . this is the biggest reason why i come to new york . i have gotten the same thing every time i ' ve been there ( Nish ) because i can ' t get enough of it and don ' t even want to try something new . lunch , dinner , or late-night binging- it always hits the spot . 
trendy and the food is good . great place to have a mojito and some great food . been here a few times , never had a bad experience . the size of the plate and cost don ' t meet up well in my opinion . this also seems to be a city trend , give us less food at a higher price . hmmmm . . . 
careful , check the hours . the point of closing at five ? i just don ' t get it . 
delicious , authentic greek food . the moussaka and tzatziki are best-sellers and i understand why . amazing . also hear the spinach pie ( spanakopita ) is great . i can taste the flavors i grew up with ! 
i love seafood , and you can ' t beat fridays happy hour for a buck a oyster . the lobster roll is also a favorite . staff are friendly and always with good suggestions . def a favorite pit stop after a long week at work . 
i was visiting ny and i told my friend to pick a place that she ' d never been , and lucky for me , she chose snack . there are only about five tables in the entire restaurant - i actually couldn ' t believe we got a table without a reservation , but it all worked out . my friend is greek , and grew up eating greek foods , so she ordered our food . we had the most amazing cheese triangles and the eggplant spread - both amazing . we also shared the lamb dish which was fantastic . overall a perfect experience , and as an added bonus is was very inexpensive . 
the food is simply excellent . everything is as close to perfect as you can get . the atmosphere was also great and the service was great ! i highly recommend . 
i ' d been dying to come here for the longest time , except i never found the time , since it seemed so out of the way . who knew it was so close to the bqe ? ! i came here with two people at N N on a friday , and it wasn ' t packed yet , so luckily for us , we were seated right away . given the fact that past reviews have mentioned exceptionally long waits , i was really happy that we didn ' t have to wait ! this was my first time trying hush puppies , and prior to this experience i had no idea what they were . regardless , they were a good snack as i starved myself for this dinner . the butter lettuce salad was really good i mean , it ' s really just a bed of lettuce - you can ' t go wrong , but duck cracklings are delicious . i guess you can tell by now that i have a guiltless soft spot for fried foods . i didn ' t order the fried chicken if you predicted i would . i ordered the steak because we all wanted to order different things . the daily special was the lobstah from rhlp , and it was delicious from the bit that i tried . the steak was a little tough at medium , and a little bland - nothing spectacular . luckily for me , my friend who ordered the chicken wasn ' t too hungry and found it impossible too finish her dish - score . the chicken was good . it was juicy , and the batter was very crispy but not the type that would leave your palette feeling raw . and cheddar waffles ? great . i didn ' t get to try the cole slaw , as my friend finished it , but given the fact that she ' s not a big fan of cole slaw and finished it anyway , i would have to say that it must have been good . 
the perfect place to have thanksgiving dinner ! inviting comfortable , incredible staff , delicious food . what more could you want ? oh , and a view of the river . it was a real treat to eat at perry st . can ' t remember another restaurant with such an attentive accommodating staff . ( they must like their work . ) definitely a N . N stars . 
i ' ve been to rooftop twice and i was less than impressed each time . while the bar itself is nice the service was horrible . the waitress lost my credit card and when the manager came to look around our table for it- obviously we had already done that- he was clearly drunk and made no attempt to rectify the situation . he wrote my name down and said he would call me the next day but he never even apologized for the lost card and even told me i should wait to cancel the card until the next day . brilliant idea sir- let someone find the card and use it all night before i shut it off . this place is not worth it . 
not the best burger in the city but damn close . i really hate bad reviews . people bash this place because it gets such great reviews for the burgers . if you dint like them , so what other people do , a lot of other people . you dint like em , dint eat here . its a dive bar with great buggers . try it , you ll most likely love it . if you dint love it , its ok , go somewhere else . peace and love . 
 got the last pie of the night . so , soprano ' s . so much jersey love . the opening credits are a car trip many of us have made with tony leaving nyc from the lincoln tunnel and making his way to the north caldwell area . i was making my way back from fair lawn and needed a quick bite to eat and since we passed pizzaland on the way , i ' d figure let ' s stop in . i read about delicious N slices so i knew what i was expecting . well this place is a dive . we walk in and it is nearly N pm so may be closing time but , it definitely wasn ' t the most festive of ambiance . seinfeld playing on the one tv , i take a seat at the counter . this place is small , like barely N tables and a counter small . there is one other sketchy guy ( really not that sketchy ) waiting for his order . the guy gruffly asks what i want . i ' ll take N slices one regular one with pepperoni and sausage . he takes out this old looking pie , cuts off N slices adds toppings to one and throws it in the oven . well just seeing that made me realize this pizza experience was going to be N star or lower the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for days . however , both slices were N . N . definitely a penny saver . the slices are thin crust , like super thin crust and greasy . the toppings were decent and definitely added to the taste . the ' zas here are super cheap , a large comes with a free topping and runs you about N . but , when i say the pizza is thin crust , it ' s extremely thin crust . so my two slices actually equals one slice or , at least that ' s what i keep telling myself . and again , they were good . best pizza ever ? not quite but , whatev ' s . decent enough and i mean c ' mon it ' s in the soprano ' s opening credits . awesome . overall , pizzaland is a solid spot . definitely a destination for soprano ' s nostalgia rather than delightful customer service and amazing pizza ( though their fresh pizza may be legendary ! ) but , i ' d imagine tony s wouldn ' t have it any other way . 
N . N stars . i came here with a large group of friends on a sunday evening , and we had to wait for about N-N minutes to get a table . while the place is large ( it occupies both the first floor and mezzanine level of the building ) , i could tell that it ' s quite popular and gets filled up rather quickly . i got the pork soondoobu soup , a staple dish in korea . it was pretty good , although i was a bit disappointed with the lack of enough pork meat in the soup . i also enjoyed the nurungji ( scorched rice ) that was served afterward . one of my friends got their bibimbop , and he said it was okay but not anything impressive . overall , i liked the venue and service , and the quality of food is decent . i would say their soondoobu is on par with those at chodang-gol , another famous korean tofu place in the area . i feel it ' s a bit overpriced , but that is a problem shared by most places in k-town . 
this is a funky , friendly , oh so tasty little cafe . as such it is N stars in the funky , friendly cafe category , not something that i give easily . but the intangibles here - the sandwiches are inventive and delicisous , the wall-sized menu board so packed that it takes several visits to unravel , the vibe so friendly and welcoming - that nothing else makes sense . highly recommended . make a point of it . 
based on the very solid reviews , a friend and i went to bahche on saturday night . i am completely boggled by all of the four-star ratings . i had a chicken pesto panini that tasted off -- there ' s no other way to put it . i took home a spinach phyllo pastry to go , and it , too , tasted off . both featured a weird bitter taste and an odor i ' m going to refrain from characterizing . but i don ' t believe the food had gone bad -- i think this is how their food tastes . mediocre and unremarkable are two words that come to mind . i ' ve never actually written a negative review on yelp -- i don ' t feel good about doing it , and figure there are others out there who will . but after having a really disappointing dinner for two last night and knowing that N ( including a N tip ) could ' ve been much better spent , say , at cubana cafe on Nth ave , i really felt like i needed to . the menu is very brief , and some reviewers had noted that . they don ' t really serve " dinner , " per se , although they said they are testing one or two entres every night . maybe this is a better brunch place ? maybe they ' re better at catering ? as others mentioned , the space is huge . and looks it when empty -- there was only one other table occupied in the entire space on a saturday night when lots of people were out . you ' d think the service would ' ve been attentive , but i can ' t even say that was the case ! i will give the waitress the benefit of the doubt and presume she was new . when a table of two orders one dessert , isn ' t it customary to serve it with two utensils so it can be shared ? last , the street is not inviting at night . i ' ve lived in bklyn for N years and i get it -- this area is turning around , millennials are moving in , etc . it ' s gowanus , not park slope . but the street the restaurant is on is not one you ' d be inclined to walk down , and indeed no one was anywhere in sight when we left around Npm . there ' s at least one body shop on the block and many of the buildings are either still warehouses or they ' re not currently being used however , it was too dark to know for sure . so all that said , i just don ' t get it ! 
omgomgomgomg . . . hehe this seriously is one of my favorite restaurants on staten island , if it werent for bayou , it would be my number one . my boyfriend and i used to go there all the time , we havent had a chance to go in a while but it really is the best place , its small but the atmosphere is great . sometimes on weekends they have live music music while you eat as well . food is amazing , and you get a lot of it for the price . great beer selection too ! 
the marrow and oxtail marmalade with salt is really good . the salt and the marmalade elevate this dish to amazing . the fried chicken and the honey are great . and the calamari is surprisingly bright and delicious - possibly some of the best calamari i ' ve had . if you only order these dishes ( and maybe some others we didn ' t try ) , you ' ll think this place rocks . the lamb chops and fried catfish are good but nothing special . ( incidentally those two and the fried chicken come with mashed potatoes on the side - the fact that the three had the same side was just odd ) . the pierogi was only okay . for dessert we had a strawberry sundae which was okay and a chocolate dessert which was somehow special but again was only okay . possibly we were expecting too much ? but i ' d heard such good things . . . next time we should also probably get some salad too , because this was a really heavy meal . 
love this place , i always get the combo with extra white and hot sauce . the lines aren ' t as bad as they used to be , especially during the night . after a night of heavy drinking , i make it a mission to get here and eat a plate or two . ) 
went there with some friends after finals . got carded at the door . i asked for a blue moon . the bartender gave me a sam adams ? ! ? the bartender was hot , so i tried to drink it , but i couldn ' t choke it down . when i told the bartender he apologized and explained they didn ' t have blue moon . he then proceeded to give my friends and i sex on the beach shots for free . not a bad bar , kinda stinky and sticky . a half hour or so goes by and the bouncers needed to check my id again ? weird ! later the bar filled with college students and we had a really great time , drinking and dancing . 
hands down best chinese food in philadelphia . don ' t expect to order chow mein here . bravo for serving things as spicy as they should be . 
definitely go after the lunch rush because the wait is long . the service was good and the food was amazing . definitely try the mochi ! ! 
beautiful outdoor seating . great for families . huge selection , one of the biggest i ' ve seen . not really a place i ' d recommend for someone who wants to try thai but is a picky eater . 
our experience at ai fiori was the highlight of our girls weekend in nyc . we splurged and did the tasting menu with wine pairings . . . and yes it was expensive , but worth it . just what a tasting menu should be , an experience . having enjoyed tasting menus at some of the best restaurants in the country over the years i can say this ranked very well . there was nothing shocking or very new to me on the menu , but for the other N gals with me it allowed for the introduction of a few new menu items . the pasta was their favorite , and while it was perfectly prepared offering up just a little sweetness and serving the need of providing for some less adventurous diners , i personally think it was outdone by the first course including sashimi , caviar , and the Nnd course of sardine was perfect . the veal was great and offered just enough heartiness into the tasting selection . the wine recommendations were very well paired , and we thoroughly enjoyed all but one . my company made the night special and the experience at ai fiori added to a weekend of great memories created in nyc with the girls . 
nasty service , food just okay , and really cool space needs to be painted to make it fresh again . 
this is pretty much the worst place in the world , filled with the worst people in the world . if you ' re a khaki-clad douch from the burbs of pennsylvania or new jersey , you will love this place . if you live for cross-fit and or group obstacle-course runs , you will love this place . if you love waiting in lines because that proves you ' re at the " in " spot , you will love this place . if you would pay N for deep-fried dogshit because stephen starr ' s name is somehow attached to it , you will love this place . 
anything you order here is good . they have the most memorable customer experience . best to stop here for lunch because the prices are high for dinner . 
la sirene was my " i owe a good meal to myself " place . i was introduced to the place by my ex-boyfriend , and i claimed the place as my own . i would recommend the goat cheese tarts , and if you ' re really wanting to treat yourself- filet mignon . 
the best wooder ice in south philly ! ice tea flavor-yum ! 
i like maialino for the food and the ambiance . i don ' t know much about italian food , and so i can ' t say much , but i really liked the dishes i ' ve got here bucatini all ' amatriciana and fettuccine alla bolognese . the sauteed spinach was great too . i especially liked the bread basket--so soft ! i came during happy hour and it ' s very corporate . if you ' re into that scene and have some dollars to spare , definitely check out maialino . the place is high class yet cozy . 
i came back again last night . i had phenomenal service , the food was just as amazing and this time i tried the blood orange margarita . wow ! ! ! ! and i consider myself a frozen margarita snob . this tells me that this place is consistently great . me likey . d
what better way to celebrate mexico kicking cameroon ' s ass in the world cup than to go have some of my favorite mexican grub ! ! chips and guac , vegetarian burritos and cheese quesadillas oh my . si , i am vegetariano ) loved every bite , as per usual , and prices can ' t be beat . mexican comfort food at its best ! ! 
went here for brunch with a couple of close friends , honestly expected the grey dog ' s breakfast to be amazing , seeing all the great reviews but it was mediocre . the grey dog ' s breakfast consisted of challah french toast , home fries , scrambled eggs and sausage . however the nachos were fantastic ! iced mint tea was also very refreshing . 
our favorite place for brunch in the city so far . awesome selection of whiskey and good bartenders . the bacon is perfectly thick and juicy . the sausage is scrumptious . the pancakes are old school . a great artesian selection of food . the service is just fine and the atmosphere is classy casual . i highly recommend this place . 
why does everything taste better here ? is it the great service from the second you walk in ? maybe the homemade sauces for the sliders ? even the beer on draft tastes better here . . . great ambience . and a great deal . oh , and i don ' t usually eat bacon- but can ' t resist with the sliders . not gonna start with the shakes . could become a habit . 
love this place ! my husband and i go here several times a year and love it ! ! we have two children ages N and N and they do quite well with the staff and environment when we let them tag along . great food and a great atmosphere ! 
picked this place because of the yelp reviews . thank you everyone i loved it ! try the gnocci with sage mmmmmmmmm
sure , they don ' t take reservations and you may wait N minutes to be seated , but the food is worth it ! from the crostini ( i like ricotta and speck ) to basically any of the pasta dishes , you ' ll experience sensory overload in the best way . yes , the cavatelli is as good , if not better , than everyone says - and the gnocchi with marinara is underrated . if you ' re lucky enough to visit in good weather , eat in the garden ! it is quite charming . the reason for four stars whenever i ' ve gotten dessert ( most recently , italian cheesecake ) , it ' s not as fresh or creamy as it could be . that and it can get super loud - otherwise , great ambiance . a must visit , especially if you ' re in the area . 
dollar oysters are the only reason why this place is getting N stars instead of N . lobster roll was ok . overpriced for the portion and too much raw onion . and a lot of lobster shell pieces . fries were good . service . . . horrible . you will have to call the server to order food . . . or even to get water . don ' t recommend it if you are in a rush since it took over N minutes for us to get water . 
the smith promises a lot , and comes close to delivering . the space itself is almost cavernous , a big tiled room full of people . the result is a lot of noise , a little too much for this brunchsters liking . that said , i could happily sip at my cocktails in silence . . . the list is amazing and the execution perfect . such a nice balance of flavours , the people behind the drinks list really know their stuff . the food was good but not amazing , the rancheros was a little bland . the chicken sausage cornbread business was ok , but i wouldn ' t consider myself a connoisseur of american cornbread gravy ! weird breakfast combo in the eyes of an aussie but there were plenty of americans tucking in happily around me . would i return ? yes , but i probably wouldn ' t be one to suggest it for food . i would definitely stop in to test out a few more of those cocktails though ! 
one of the best places around to find pretty much everything . go on an empty stomach and you will probably find exactly what you want to satisfy yourself . from sweets to savory you really can ' t go wrong . forget the liberty bell or any of the other stuff , this is one place that has to be a stop for anyone who visits or lives in philly . 
wow ! i ' d walked past this place many times , and even tried to get a seat once or twice , but things never seemed to work out between us . finally , i was able to get a seat on a wednesday afternoon . this is one of those rare places where nothing on the menu really leaped out at me as a clear choice , because everything sounded so good ! i will definitely be back to eat up the rest of the menu that i didn ' t get a chance to try . on wednesday , i decided to go with the turkey wrap with bacon , avocado , pepper jack cheese and a chipotle mayo . disclaimer ex ante , this is the sandwich of my dreams . i guess this means that my expectations were probably pretty high . the actual food did not disappoint ! everything was clearly fresh , the flavors were clean , and everything went together perfectly . i also had a slice of lemon merengue pie , which was obviously delicious . my coffee was hot ( they made a fresh pot for me i was there at a slow time ) and delicious . moreover , our server was nice , and not over-attentive ( i like to eat at restaurants , not exchange platitudes ) . bottom line i will be back . my three words for this restaurant are fresh , classic , and clean . try to go off-peak hours if possible . 
great prices , awesome service , delicious food and a ridiculous beer menu . what more can you really ask for ? i would not hesitate to recommend anything we tried from my cream soda flavored beer ( yeah , you read that right ) to the basket of knishes , and finally the delicious grilled cheeses ( so far , my fave is the gouda with pickled jalape os ) . i only wish we saved room to try the desserts ! a true astoria gem . i think this one could stick around for a while . 
pho real is the best sandwich ever . i ' ve been to this spot twice in a week . the best part is that they are open N hours . it ' s cash only so make sure you take a trip to the atm before heading all the way over . if you forget they always have an atm machine but then again you ' d be paying a surcharge not to mention bank fees . so don ' t do it . yeah . . . you ' re welcome . jk . anyways , there are so many different sandwiches , all of which are tasty . the biden is solid . all the sandwiches are about N- N which for bodega prices is usually a bit steep but it ' s alphabet city and it ' s a specialty sandwich so don ' t complain . the pickles are horrendous but that ' s an easily forgivable offense . 
quite possibly the best pizza i have had in dumbo . the crust was cooked to perfection the pizza was crispy without being burned and the cheese and toppings had the perfect amount of snap to soft ratio . 
i ' ve been hearing about this place for ages and finally got to come in . such a cute little space . bartender was very helpful helping me choose my wine . i didn ' t eat anything , and no one seemed to be there for the food either , but will definitely be back for the ambiance ! 
stopped by here on a busy friday night and got a table outside which was nice . they have a pretty good drink selection so i got a white sangria which was tasty and my husband got a margarita which he loved ! we then had the bruschetta which i would definitely recommend not getting as it wasn ' t an impressive flavor combination but if you like olives perhaps you would enjoy . the complimentary rolls were tasty - crusty on the outside but soft on the inside , and the olive oil was nicely seasoned with fresh herbs . we then ordered the four cheese pizza to share which was pretty cheesy and cooked well but the pizza and toppings both lacked flavor . overall the food was okay and it was difficult to get our severs attention - perhaps he had too many tables ? not sure but probably won ' t be a headed back to this place in the near future unless we hear better things about their pasta options ! 
absolutely fantastic meal ! the rice bowls are delicious and the service was wonderful . the restaurant is geared towards smaller parties , but i went with a party of N and the wait was not long whatsoever . i am really impressed with the food coming from san francisco , home of many great yakitori places . i would highly recommend to any one looking for good quality , great tasting good . the atmosphere is great and the service was good ! 
i ' m sorry to every one who have the business of biscuit sandwich because i found an amazing place where i decided to go there and buy my biscuit sandwich all life . hold your heartbeat friends this place is cheeky sandwiches . let me tell that awesome awesome amazing this place . they have great sandwiches for an affordable price . good staff service , great and relaxing atmosphere , fresh items , awesome food quality . thank . 
my husband and i also came here for restaurant week N . had high hopes , as we ' ve always seen outstanding reviews . i ' m not going to talk about the food . . . it was delicious ! what i will share is what the experience was around the food , because i feel that when you ' re in an expensive restaurant , that is something that should not be overlooked . the first thing you ' ll notice is no table linens . . . well , ok i say to myself , no big deal . next , when the friendly waiter asked for our drink order , the two craft beers my husband asked for were out . okay , so he orders from what they have on hand . i order a glass of prosecco , and we decide on tap water . ( hint this is the wrong choice ) another waitress comes back with two glasses and room-temperature water in an old bottle . no ice . my husband just looks at it and says , " could they have made it any more obvious that they just ran this under the faucet ? we ask for a glass of ice , so again , no big deal . we order our appetizers , and they ' re delicious . as the waitress takes our empty plates , she puts our food-encrusted silverware back on the bare table . i was pretty surprised at that one . we then wait about N minutes for our entrees . obviously , the service is unpredictable . now keep in mind , there ' s no bread served at the table , so while you ' re waiting , you ' ve got nothing to nosh on . and you ' re getting pretty hungry seeing and smelling everyone else ' s food go by . we ' re by the window . . . wouldn ' t it be nice if the view didn ' t look like route N springfield with all the car lots ? anyway , it ' s almost comedic when the food did arrive , and my petit filet is about an inch wide and four inches long . seriously , this could be a scene from a movie ! well , in all fairness , there was an extremely artistic mashed potatoe swirl alongside the steak . it was at least a hearty tablespoonful , so what the heck am i complaining about ? again , no complaints about the flavor or quality of the food . we receive our dessert rather quickly my banana bread pudding was okay , my husband said his berry tart was overly tart . so , at this point , i ' m noticing how really warm it is in the restaurant . i ask the server about that . he says rather amusingly , " if you think it ' s hot out here , you should see what the kitchen feels like ! " . so glad that we cleared that up . . . btw , i work with a c contractors , and i can say w o a doubt that this equipment was incorrectly sized for the room . there ' s no reason for a restaurant with modern comfort equipment to feel as uncomfortable as this did . the price fixe dinner is N . pp the restaurant charges a N gratuity automatically . with our drinks , and gratuity the bill came to N . for the two of us . i handed the waiter my credit card on the non-itemized receipt that came back , there was the N charge and below that a line that read tip and a straight line next to it to add to the total . i did call the waitress over , just to verify i wasn ' t going crazy , that i had already paid the tip . she said , rather absentmindedly , " oh yeah , the machine is doing that . i don ' t know why " , and walked away . so she ' s aware of it , yet says nothing when she brings the check ? i think almost everyone out there can relate to this i know several years ago , my father tipped twice at an expensive family dinner in manhattan , because this exact same thing happened , and he had been drinking . we always had a bad feeling about that restaurant because of that , and never returned there . so all i can say is that i ' m glad we only spent N on our dinner . if we had spent twice that ( which would be the norm here ) i think i really would have been upset . and for the chef owner at a minimum , don ' t you think your customers deserve to be comfortable , and to get fresh silverware between courses ? or is this experience only about you and your food . . . 
my friends and i visited nyc last summer and my friend ' s cousin who is a local took us to malatesta and it was very good . such a nice restaurant , not touristy and is situated in a little corner . they only have a few things on the menu . i had the ravioli which was very good and my friend had the risotto . i don ' t normally like risotto but this was very good . the waiters were very nice . i really like this place and if i ' m ever in nyc i ' ll definitely come back . if i know people going to nyc i tell them about this place . great restaurant ! 
thank you for existing double windsor , i really mean that . i feel lucky to have dw as my local . the best thing for me about the bar is the staff , all the bartenders and kitchen staff are friendly and interesting ( and easy on the eyes , uncalled for i know ) . the owners seem like industry pros who know quality product as the beer selection is great and the food is also very good . i love the pub style food service and the open and warm decor and set up of the place . keep on truckin ' dw ! 
my boyfriend and i go here for brunch multiple times per month . it is delicious , has consistently good service , and the brunch special makes it cost-effective as well . we ' d definitely recommend it as a reliable and quality brunch spot in nyc . try the eggs benedict and the french toast , and make sure to get a side of home fries . 
preliminary note to the hipsters obstructing my path to the counter i am not afraid to bust ya heads . true , i may not look gangster , but when i wake up on a sunday morning , and grumpily head over to clinton st . baking company to pick up my takeout order in my shorts and sweater , i don ' t need dirty looks from you , and i certainly don ' t need you standing there , stupidly , gazing like a retarded walrus at me . yeah fools , i live nearby , and i can order this delicious food and take it to my home , where i will laugh at you for waiting N-N minutes for a pancake while i lick maple butter and sugar-cured bacon crumbs off my fingertips . onto the review yes , this place is all that and more when it comes to brunch . the pancakes are divine , and the spanish scramble is indeed an omelet par excellence . hell , even that weird biscuit sandwich thing is good . everything is good . if you come here for brunch and arbitrarily select N things from the menu , you will leave happy , guaranteed . i wish i could build a houdini-like torture apparatus of their sugar-cured bacon , and then proceed to eat my way out of it . but bring a lot of cash . it ' s expensive , and inexplicably , clinton st . leaves its credit card machine off during the day , so their breakfast brunch biz is a cash-only enterprise ( really inexcusable inconvenient for a place like this ) . dinner is pretty good ( and they take credit cards ) . the menu changes a bit , but the burgers , sandwiches , and shrimp and grits are all mainstays , and are all quite good . dinner is ( for obvious reasons ) a much less frantic experience than brunch . 
this place is so good from the service to the food i will definitely be going back to bayou
i really wanted to love this place based on the reviews but i was pretty disappointed . here ' s the scoop in a nut shell -great band performing on thursday nite- best part of the night ! -beautiful , cozy , great atmosphere -our apps beet salad and empanadas were good . -our main courses- the steak sandwich came with stale luke warm fries and the breaded chicken with fried sweet potatoes was not exciting at all . . . - service was bad , apps came out , no one asked how they were , main course arrived with empty app plates still on table and no one ever asked us how our main course was . . . . good thing we were busy listening to the band . . 
i came here with my family christmas eve day for a nice lunch . my family and i were seated immediately . the waitress was very nice and always around to refill our drinks . the only issue that we had was they didn ' t have the food my dad had ordered so they just made up a plate for him . he was not happy about that and he had every right to be . i think that the waitress could have told him that they were out of what he had ordered and should have asked if there was anything else on the menu that he wanted . my dad ended up giving the dish back and the manager was immediately at our table apologizing . he was so nice . he comped our appetizers which i thought was very nice to do . the food was good , nothing to brag about . i would definitely come back , but the customer service is one of the main reasons why i will be returning because the manager was so prompt to address any issues that we had . 
the drinks were outstanding . the spicy tuna rolls were better than any i ever had at sushi bars and the wasabi mashed potatoes blew my mind . i loved this place . my only concern is that it ' s so loud you can ' t have a decent conversation . it ' s ridiculous . everything else was amazing . 
an incredible selection of beers and whiskeys , bourbons , ryes - everything liquid ! i was not convinced by the food though ! burgers were a bit too dry , shrimp sliders extremely dry ( the shrimp was so deep fried there was hardly anything left that resembled a shrimp ) and both batches of the ipa fries we got were a bit cold-greasy . old rasputin imperial stout stood out with it ' s predictable good quality . i will not order food again , but will definitely grab some drinks the next time in the neighborhood . ( for the sweet-tooths , there ' s a hungarian pastry shop on the corner ! ) 
i genuinely wish i could give talk of the town even more stars ! N doesn ' t seem like enough for the food and service we received . my first time at talk of the town was when they first opened and it was relatively empty so the owner spent a great deal of time with us guiding us on our order . i just went for the second time this past weekend and i ' m happy to say that the owner still spent as much time with us and was just as charming and friendly as when the place first opened . the big difference was that this time the place was practically packed ! try the chole bhatura for sure . you know when you ' ve had it at other places and your fingers end up a greasy mess ? not with these bhaturas ! and the owner suggested a special dessert for us--raabdi--which had a delicious pudding-like consistency and was clearly homemade . also highly recommended--the aloo masala fries ( yum ! ) and the samosas ( classic ) . a sit down lunch for four with appetizers and dessert came out to just around N a person . . . you can ' t beat that ! ( of course , i had to add a few extra dollars to order a chole bhatura to go . . . yes it ' s that good ) . if you are within a half hour drive of this place , do it . it ' s totally worth it ! 
i ' m scared of the lower east side ( after dark ) but i gave this spot a try and really liked it . it ' s in a semi-awkward location , as i found myself in an alley unsure if i was entering the wrong way . but once i got inside , i met a girlfriend at the bar for a glass of wine while we waited for our table ( no rezzies . . . gotta wait at least N mins if its packed ) . when we got seated our waitress was very friendly and prompt . we got the artichoke dip as an app which was delicious . for our entrees , we both ordered the filet and loved it . overall great spot for a date or just a casual catch-up ! 
one of my favorite restaurants in this neighborhood . i can ' t believe it ' s taken me so long to post this review . my usual go to dishes are their hainanese chicken and rice along with the stir fried kangkung yummmmmmmers their roti canai is huge . their stir fried noodles were also good and so was their shredded chicken noodles except there wasn ' t much chicken . the noodles were nice and soft . also had their noodle soup with seafood which was better than the last noodle soup i tried . service is typical for any asian restaurant . . . they seat you , bring you water and food . you have to flag them down if you want anything else . i could honestly care less , as long as they continue to bring out consistently delicious dishes . wait get pretty crazy during peak dinner time though fyi . 
jizzes christ ! best sandwich i ever had . i like the pork , provolone , and brocoli rabe better than pork , provolone and spinach . but both are sublime
this place is pretty over-hipped . i ' ve waited N hours to get a table here and then N more hours to get my food . there are other great restaurants in new york that are a better deal for your wallet and your time . 
bueno , yerba buena . your delicious havana inspired meal had me singing your praises like ricky ricardo all night long . at first i felt ashamed to give this place five stars , because , let ' s face it . it ' s not N star michelin . there ' s no snooty foie gras with an overindulgent french accent on the side . but then i realized , this is yelp - or what i like to call , " the homeless man ' s new york times . " so , for all you homeless yelpers out there that are looking for a stellar dining experience without pretensions , just plain fine flavors and friendliness , please choose yerba buena . it was one of the most pleasant dining experiences i ' ve had from start to finish . the food , the drinks , the service , the atmosphere excellent . but to break it down . . . . i waited for my girlfriend at the bar and the friendly bartender sporting that sexy antonio banderas accent persuaded me to try the pisco guava- macchu pisco brandy , guava pur e , fresh lemon juice . what a great recommendation . later in the night i had the desert rose- but my heart belonged to the pisco guava . from the menu you must order this palmitos fritos- panko-ed hearts of palm with a smoky crust and aioli sauce . they were perfect . we ordered two . oops . i guess that ' s what happens when you ' re drunk on guava . fish taco appetizer- very good , but probably my least favorite of our choices . i found the taco to be a little too soggy- and there was a flavor in their jicama that was throwing me off . for entrees we split the cod and the short ribs . both incredible , beautifully cooked and the sides were very well matched . the waitstaff was lovely , attentive but not overwhelming , helpful , suggestive , friendly without going overboard . it ' s what all new york restaurant service should hope to aspire to . once they lowered the lights , the ambiance was also great . bathrooms are clean and beautiful . and we sat in the back corner . romance , romance . i ' ll pass on your fish , eric ripert . you can shove some more pasta in your stomach , mario battali . and hey ! i don ' t need your witchcraft , tom colicchio . i ' ve already been charmed by yerba buena . 
yum . just as a remember from my first ippudo visit . i came here for dinner before a show and luckily since i was by myself , i only had to wait about N minutes to sit at the bar table ! this place was packed on a sat night-i heard waits around N hours . this location is closer to times square but was just as busy . service here was fine , i informed my waitress i had a show to go to and she helped to expedite my service towards the end . i ordered the shiromaru hakata classic- savory and tasty broth and loved those thin ramen noodles , everything else went well with it also . i was hoping to order a side od the steamed buns as well but was too full ! would still recommend coming to ippudo if in ny . . . delicious ramen ! just be prepared to wait if in a large group . 
went here back in may twice in the same weekend - once on friday and once on saturday - because the first time we got food here it was amazing . both me and my boyfriend had chicken and waffles at around N in the morning , and we both agreed that it was perfect the first time we went . i ' d recommend anybody to get their chicken and waffles . 
my boyfriend took me there for dinner . it was amazing ! it was like being on the titanic . food was great and so was ambiance . 
oh gosh what a mess . my friend and i went here for cinco de mayo yesterday and it was a disaster . el camino is a mexican restaurant . therefore , it is not unreasonable to think that they should have been adequately prepared to handle the crowd may Nth brings to their establishment . i don ' t know , maybe i ' m asking too much . regardless , the entire staff looked stressed out , and understandably so . can ' t fault them for that . it was really crowded and ( most ) people were belligerently drunk . but the food . . . . . oh my goodness , the food was absolutely terrible . it has never been that bad there before . the pico de gallo was under-seasoned and missing any trace of cilantro . the chips were over-seasoned , but what else is new . the green salsa tasted like baby food puree . all things that are typically pre-made , yes ? yikes . our guacamole was underwhelming it was a paste-like consistency and also ( wait for it ! ) under-seasoned . our veggie wings were , i would assume , triple deep fried . my plate was swimming in wing sauce my friend ' s was bone dry . seitan jerky if you will . neither of us finished even half of our food , and no one on staff noticed . oh and the drinks . my friend got a margarita on the rocks with salt the bartender must have dumped salt into the drink because it tasted like the ocean . i had a mojito . it ' s lime mint ratio was way off and i took two sips . not to say i haven ' t had good meals here , because i have and , normally , i wouldn ' t base my entire opinion on one ( atrocious ) experience , but this particular instance was just soooo bad . everything failed service , atmosphere , food , and drinks . really disappointing . 
after another great experience , i decided i ' m not going to hate just because they use little olives in their martinis . i shouldn ' t be drinking martinis with pizza anyway , i should be drinking wine . lesson learned . on a saturday night when we were too exhausted to do any restaurant research , pietro ' s was a no-brainer for an easy , relaxing dinner spot . at around N , there were plenty of open tables and minimal distractions . our server was attentive and friendly , and both the salad and pizza we ordered came out perfect . in a city filled with fancy , well-acclaimed restaurants , the always dependable and wallet-friendly pietro ' s remains one of my favorites . 
the service was good . our waiter was very attentive . the food however was edible but sup par . they show really nice photos here as if they really care about presentation but our food was a little sloppily served . that would have been ok if the food tasted good . well it was ok , but i wouldn ' t go again unless i was invited by a friend . 
best pho in town , hands down . and i ' ve tried them all . their broth has that perfect mix if richness and spice . the noodles are always perfect , firm and not mushy . their meats are delicious , too . the place is not much to look at , but i ' ll take delicious food in a simple decor over restaurants who invest in look and forget to make good food . 
food , ambience and service is excellent ! chicken noodle soup is homemade and delicious . always order some to take home . pancakes , burgers , fries incl . sweet potato fries are delicious . chicken francaise melts in your mouth . have eaten here at all times of day and you can ' t go wrong . 
this little hole in the wall is the best . no liquor license but you can sit across the street at the local bar and have the hostess come over when your table is ready , what a treat . do not miss the grilled octopus it ' s the best i ever had and i ' ve had it just about everywhere . fabulous grilled whole fish , the pompano happens to be my favorite . and the greek salad is wonderful also . if you love fish , the bluefish , greek style will fit your bill . be patient . . . because the wait is worth it . enjoy ! ! ! 
luzzo ' s is all around fantastic . it ' s simply and tastefully decorated , the service has been consistently wonderful , and the truffle pie is out of control . i dream about it . a nice place to go on a casual date . one of my favorite pizza spots in nyc . i used to live across the street and miss it terribly . 
it makes me sad to write this review but there was no opportunity to get our point across at farm yesterday so i ' m left with no choice . farm on adderley has always been a favorite in my family-both for food and service . however yesterday ' s ( mother ' s day ) experience was unbelievable shocking . we arrived ( three adults , one two year old ) for brunch right when they opened . the restaurant filled quickly and clearly they were not at all prepared . we ordered two egg dishes , a burger and a side of scrambled eggs and toast-didn ' t seem complicated . the food took over one hour to come-that is no exaggeration . the waitress didn ' t even try to offer anything ( bread , some fruit for our child , water . . . ) and just kept blaming the kitchen . apparently " the burger takes longer . " we have a N grill at home and you can cook a burger in N minutes . we were not the only extremely dissatisfied customers ( some bordered irate and left , went to ct muffin , got coffee and muffins and came back and their food still was not out ) . i ' ve been a waitress-stuff happens in the kitchen you can ' t control but how about saying " let me warn you our burgers take a long time " when someone orders it . or at least make sure you keep their water glass full ! fyi-the food came out lukewarm at best , the eggs were runny and my husband ' s burger was sub-par at best , not even served on the english muffin that was advertised ! argh ! luckily it was a very happy mother ' s day despite the lousy food and service ! 
the pizza is not that great , frankly . it left a watery ' glop ' on the plate and didn ' t have much flavor . the middle was chewy as if undercooked . they serve iced tea in a bottle which i didn ' t expect . they charge N . N for each cup of coffee--no free refills here ! ( didn ' t occur to us to ask and got socked for N cups ! ) the parking is poor--only a few spaces allotted for the restaurant . i wouldn ' t go back unless they add more items to their menu since it ' s extremely limited right now . 
honestly , i was surprised at how good the food is . the long line outside was not deceiving . i ordered the fried green tomatoes , and corn cakes . literally the best corn cakes i ' ve ever had . they were so good ! i can taste them now . my friend ordered the hot chicken , she said it was delicious . it was a little out of the way , but i ' d definitely say check it out . 
fantastic , busy vibe with uncompromising food and service . had the tasting menu and was so pleased . . . . the portions were fair , all the dishes incredible ( especially the pasta ! ) and we left feeling full , but not overstuffed . great selection of reasonably priced italian wines , and the sommelier was full of good suggestions . highly recommended ! 
terrific new byob near kimmel center in center city for foodies ! four of us had dinner last evening . everything we ordered was delicious and flavorful ! all the starters were home runs and unusual , including the english pea sformato and cuttlefish ink farfalle . two of us had the zucchini raviolis that were so light , they melted in your mouth ! all four of our entrees were extremely well prepared and presented . it had been hard to choose ! my fresh fish in parchment with fennel , gold zucchini , and tarragon , released a heavenly herbal aroma as it was placed on the table . the lancaster duck , the pork , and the housemade sausage won rave reviews from my friends . sharing kristen ' s delicious light desserts was the perfect way to end a first visit to russet . highly recommend ! will be back for more great dining in a great space ! i almost forgot to mention what a charming dining room that added to the ambiance ! we loved meeting andrew the chef owner and his wife , co-owner and dessert chef extraordinaire ! reservations recommended . 
this is a perfectly acceptable italian restaurant with a wide variety of menu options . the food is fine and you can expect to always get food that is fine . i particularly enjoy the pappardella montrachet . the specials range more into exceptional - but they are also priced as exceptional . ( the specials generally revolve around seafood . ) the dining room is spacious and well kept sometimes a bit noisy . service is generally friendly and efficient . this is a byob . the pizza parlor is generally pretty busy and we have had both good and bad luck with pies to go . we have decided friday night is not the night to order out pizza , but saturday has been fine . not sure if that is a staff or volume issue , but this is our observation . 
this place is expensive . came to N for N and that was with living social discount . would have been N and really not worth it . the ambiance is too dark and the noise level loud . the tasting menu took about N hours to roll out and was variable in quality . the samozas were good but the salads were strange to say the least . there were too many items wit spinach . the onion rings sucked . the main course which were curries were average . our waiter was too talkative and patronising . the deserts were N of the same thing . 
never ate here but bar is expensive and waitresses were rude . 
went for brunch with a group and was really impressed with the food and service . the bulalo has is to die for , the broth and the garlic rice are just divine in and of themselves , but the marrow on the side just takes this over the top ! my wife got the chori burger , which was super amazing too . wish we had room in our bellies to try some other stuff . service was really great , helpful and knowledgeable the only downside is that the drinks are overpriced . good but overpriced
food and atmosphere are great . excellent service ! 
well it ' s definitely an experience . not sure an experience that i want to repeat . where to start ? well , let start with the fact that i get it , i understand what the owner ( s ) are trying to do , avoid the seafoods that are over fished and unsustainable but it doesn ' t excuse poor service and average tasting sushi . if you ' re into trendy , hip and can excuse the previously mentioned , this is the place for you . if you want decent service and great food , you may want to think twice . seating apparently if you ' re less than a party of N , you can ' t get a reservation but when we asked how long the wait was going to be ( N minutes before we arrived ) we were told it was going to be a Nmin wait , N hour later we were finally seated in the middle of a walkway . N minutes later we were then acknowledged by our waitress . but the positive is that it gave us almost enough time to digest the war and peace size menu . wait staff let ' s talk about the wait staff , our waitress seemed nice and positive but unfortunately she suffers from a lack of attentiveness as her co-workers suffers from a lack of professionalism . one even was trying to be " efficient " by carrying more dirty dishes than he should by hand , dropped one and splattered food all over my jacket , that was hanging on the back of my seat , at first i didn ' t notice but when i did ( N minutes later ) , the waiter then asked if he " got me " . he was very apologetic and took care of it by getting some soda water and N worth of gift cards but would any of that happened if i didn ' t check my jacket ? i honestly don ' t think so , i understand accidents happen but it would have been nice if he had just asked me to check if he may have splattered my jacket . another decided to use a dining room chair as a step stool to lean over the sushi bar to hand a drink to the sushi chefs . strange behavior during business hours but the more disturbing part , he didn ' t clean off the seat so a customer would ultimately sit on whatever was on the bottom of his shoes . and the finale , one waiter was doing shots with a couple of , apparent , college girls . the food the appetizers were the best of the meal . once we had the " sushi " , it was just average . the rice , just didn ' t taste like sushi rice , more like a bland brown rice . some of the rolls just lacked flavor , even with the over compensation of added cheese in the rolls . the dessert , we had the seven deadly sushi ( pretty good ) and i ' m must have missed that it was only N bite per N . N , so we got a N shock . bottomline as i mentioned before , if you want hip and trendy , give it a try . if you want more , like great service and food . . . well you have been warned . who knows you may love it , there are plenty of people on yelp that do . 
great atmosphere , fresh delicious food and best beer selection in the area ! 
this place definitely lives up to all the hype imho . it was a freezing late december afternoon and we arrived at ippudo right before they opened before dinner . thankfully they let all the many , many people waiting for them to open to do so in their from entrance by the bar . it was very chaotic when the girl finally came out with the notepad to take everyone ' s name down for the waitlist . so when they finally opened , we were part of the first large group to be sat . we ordered the tori tatsutage and it was so freaking good ! even the lotus root chips were good ! for my ramen i ordered the akamaru ramen w kakuni . first of all , the black garlic oil is so freaking good ! the kakuni was so soft and tasty . the bf went with shiromaru ramen and it was good , but definitely not as good as the akamaru ramen . i with they sold that garlic oil stuff . i ' d buy a whole case of it ! aside from the food being so freaking good ( ! ! ! ) , i absolutely love the decor . perfect for a date or a group of friends wanting really great ramen . pricey ? yeah . worth every penny ? hell yeah ! 
this place has some great sushi , great rolls , amazing chicken teriyaki , although it is way overpriced . go to nori in wayne instead , same great food for less money . our waitress was cold and pushy , as if we were bothering her by walking in for lunch . 
awesome banh mi . vietnamese hoagies are near and dear to my heart , because while traditional hoagies use lettuce and tomatoes as a nutritional balance to the junkie meat , the veggies in banh mi actually has a flavor . oh and what flavor ! i got two bbq beef banh mi and two iced coffees . the total ? N . N ( no tip bc i was just taking out sandwiches ) if that ' s not value , i don ' t know what it is . yes , it ' s on a sketchy block in a sketchy place of the hood , but once you go into the restaurant , you realize what looks like a crack ring from the outside is actually a well-lit , active , and incredibly busy shopping center ( connected to nam son ) . word of advice - don ' t buy the prepared food that are on the counter we got summer rolls , and yes , they were fresh , but lacked flavor and the shrimp was a bit iffy . 
way overpriced . poor service . i miss the previous grant sucuan on the same spot
foh staff excellent . probably best in town . our water glasses were refilled many times . our server checked in on us appropriately . the hostesses did not forget about us while we were waiting and notified us as the status of our table a couple of times . first impressions - the salsa they give you is the smallest portion of salsa ever . . . my guess is its N-N tablesppons at most . i definitely don ' t mind a long wait if the food is worth it ( like at sushihana ) however , the food at villalobos was lack luster at best . i ordered N tacos - al pastor , tinga , and camarones . the chicken in the tinga taco tasted like it was simmered in campbell ' s tomato soup and was weirdly dry . all of the tacos were dry . perhaps if they gave you a tiny bit more salsa we could have used that to . i wont be back . casa piquin blows this place out of the water ( even with that strange smell ) . 
good customer service , always friendly . food is delicious . what more can you ask for ? at time the waiting is long , but its worth it . 
i think this restaurant is definitely worth a try . i love the peaceful decor , the service was so friendly from the hostess to the server , and the food concept of market to table , organic , locally grown is my favorite . however , a big warning , lots of the appetizer dishes are fried and the menu description doesn ' t mention it . ask first " is this dish fried " for any dish you want . i think from a health standpoint , it was not a good meal for me . the flavors were good , but again , heavy oiled . i will go back and carefully ask about each dish . the goat cheese pizza with spinach was very good and the wild striped bass was also good . wine selection is very good . they offered a truffle pizza for N which is over the top in my opinion but i hope someone who tries it will write a review . 
this was my first time trying this place and boy did i like it . very fulling dishes although it may not seem much but their noodles will stuff you up like a balloon . loving their kimchi , pork and chicken as well . 
we came to this bar to see the final world cup match . the poor service was compounded by a nasty manager . the manager walked around yelling at everyone that if they didn ' t order more drinks he would shut the tv off , a challenging task at a bar with such poor service . the manager told the bouncer to throw out another patron if he didn ' t order another drink . in a neighborhood with plenty of bar options , there no need to subject oneself to rattle n hum . 
we were introduced to joseph leonard a few years ago by a good friend . since that first introduction , we have frequented often . . . nearly once a month ( which is a feat for people who don ' t live very close by ) . j . leonard it has become our favorite restaurant in nyc . our service tonight just solidified our feelings toward this place . the wait . . . which is always long ! . . . was an hour , but lacy ( the maitre ' d ) helped us navigate a nook to have a drink while we waited . the manager came by to thank us for waiting , and had a good laugh about how busy it was on such a miserable winter night . we then got lucky enough to get the " chef table " - where aaron , the chef , was a wonderful host dinner guest . our food - the pork hock dish , salmon , amazing brussels sprouts , brocollini , and the macaroni - was amazing , as always . and our drinks were phenomenal as well ! overall , it was yet another a great experience . absolutely love this place ! 
i think this may have become one of my favorite places in philly . the services was great and it has a great bottle beer list . my friend and i tried the thanksgiving balls and they were incredible . the menu is funky and offers many different dishes . i cannot wait to go back ! 
love the tomato pie here , but get put off when fat slob customers feel the need to shake or fist bump the guys making the pies . i ' m sitting down eating , fat slob comes out of the bathroom and needs to shake the hands of the pie maker . hey guys , please tell these slobs and everyone to keep their hands to themselves . you ' re touching my food , keep your hands sanitary . it didn ' t happen once , it was like six times . i don ' t care if he ' s your goomba from the old neighborhood , keep your hands away from them . 
the major world religions agree ( in practicality ) on very few things . the one thing they do agree on is that ishkabibble ' s is the mecca of cheesesteaks . they come up big in everyway , taste , freshness , and overall satisfaction . besides , this is the only philly steak place in a meek mill rap . if you can experience only one philly cheesesteak make it this one- fries are awesome . from waffle fries to sweet potato you can ' t go wrong . . . been coming here for over N years , there is no other go . . . . . . . . 
best burgers around yes they are ! great fries tioo , the vegan shake is great its just real pricy to go there
the beer list is out of this world . delicious ( but expensive ) food . long wait , but the beer room downstairs made up for it
i love this place ! i go to hell ' s kitchen all the time . it ' s my comfort place because it ' s always reliable and consistent . great bar food excellent shows ! the best part of this place is their shows are incredible and free ! where can you go to see live bands , sideshow and burlesque for free now of days ? i think it ' s incredible that this venue is able to do that and the drinks are affordable . best bar , hands down . 
underwhelming in every respect . mediocre service , food , and decor . impressive open kitchen with many " chefs " . expensive , but not worth it . we ended up tossing the leftovers . surprised it has received good reviews in local magazine ' s . not a restaurant i would go to again . 
jon ur crazy . they get alot of business so , they are busy . thats why it took long ass ole . we moved to branford form east haven and they drive all the way to us promptly enough for us and we ' re a town away . so jon cause shut his mouth and go somewhere else . keep doin ur thing china star u got our vote ! ! ! 
inexpensive and delicious ! 
umm , eww . this pizza is disgusting . the crust was like cardboard - tasteless and extremely chewy ! it actually hurt my teeth to bite it ! i got delivery and the pizza actually arrived almost cold . it ' s N degrees out , there is no excuse for that ! on a better note , the sauce is tangy and tasty , just the way i like it . but a girl can not live by sauce alone ! i will not be eating this " famous " pizza ever again . lombardi ' s is the tila tequila of pizza restaurants - you might take it to dinner once but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and you ' d never introduce it to your friends . 
okay i heard about this place in philly mag and thought i would give it a shot so one night me and my husband went to try it we got a small buffalo chicken thin square pie it was amazing but thats not why we gave them one star the following week we took some friends there and we wanted to try the pasta i got the pasta pescatora my husband got the linguine and clams , my two friends got the baked ziti with broccoli and the other got the penne rosa everything was okay but i thought the best part was the salad the pasta was way too bland and the garlic needs to be saut ed more . the garlic knots need to have more garlic as well . another thing that bothered me was the fountain sodas they had black mold floating in them i think you guys need to get people who know how to clean . the other thing that made all of us upset that night was the owner all he did while we where eating is how was everything ? and insisted to continue talking to us about stuff we really do not care about . im the type of person when im sitting there with people to eat and stuff please leave me alone . thank you other than those things i would definitely recommend trios for pizza only ! ! ! ! ! a few helpful tips hire people who know how to cook hire people who clean better and pay attention for detail stop talking about yourself so much design a better more inviting environment
food was good -- but i guess as it should be expected for southern cuisine -- it was quite heavy . i must say their biscuit is delicious , and they also offer some great fresh juices , which i didnt expect . not a million things to chose from , but they ' re known for every dish on their menus . atmosphere is nice , but expect a heavy smell of frying oil when you enter ( we were at the very back of the restaurant , much more enjoyable in my opinion ) . 
best pizza in bayonne . guy was a little " cold " when we first started going . turns out he ' s a really a nice guy once he sees you more than once . if you want pizza done the right way you should give this place a try . 
ahhh i love this area ! we were too early for dinner at barbuto , so figured we could grab a good cocktail before heading over to dinner . on the outside , it looks like a physic reading place , but look carefully , it ' s employees only ! this place open at Npm on saturday , we walked in around N Npm , and viola , there was a bar full of people . we were lucky enough to snag the last N bar stools . right off the bat , we ordered N yummy drinks westside ( lemon-lime ish ) , amelia ( berry-ish ) and billionaire cocktail ( that ' s right , that ' s how i roll ) . the drinks are quite strong and definitely worth the N drink . i like the ambiance a lot , but given we were here when they opened , i can ' t comment for what this place becomes when it gets later . i do know that our bartender was very attentive and professional with his drinks ! love mixologists ! ! 
very cool hip spot with a great selection of gourmet burgers and cocktails ! very cool ! 
get get get the pancakes . the regular buttermilk pancakes are some of the best i ' ve had . 
i came here for dinner with two of my friends . bianca is a fairly small restaurant and can be easily missed if passed by . the interior design was homy and comfy , but i feel the distance between tables are a bit too narrow . we ordered the mussels , gnocchi with cheese and tagliolini with bolognese sauce all together . all three dishes were pretty decent . the mussels were juicy and healthy , except the soup were a little too salty for me . the gnocchi was really cheesy and filling . the tagliolini was nice but not super impressive . we ordered a slice of tiramisu for dessert and i enjoyed it a lot . this is not a standard tiramisu but i liked the chocolate chip with the every bite i took . i would come back for other plates , especially their desserts . 
if i could give negative stars i would . i asked for a grey goose dirty martini and when they didn ' t have it and i was hesitant to accept a vodka brand i hadn ' t heard of i was told , " grey goose use to cost N a bottle , its not even a good vodka . " i responded that its more about if i like the taste ( i dont like kettle one ) , and i don ' t appreciate the insulting comment . the way the bartender spoke to me was completely insulting and im not sure why . did not order a drink and wont be back . 
this is my favorite italian market in ny . you can find most anything and it has restaurants in it . check out the rooftop beer garden and restaurant ! 
had charcoal chicken with a cup of cappuccino for lunch . the meat is on the lighter side , the taste is sweet . i also like the little heart on my cappuccino . i know it was lunch time , all of the stuffs were very serious , no smile at all . i don ' t feel the " completely at home " experience . 
good for vegans good ethiopian food place is very small
miso ramen was the only thing i tried and it was definitely yummy ! have to go back soon ) 
i ordered a barbecue chicken pizza from alpha delta . it was alright . . . nothing really special , but not bad at all . the prices seemed a little lower than most other places in the area , so all things considered it was a good value . 
pricey . . . . . great atmosphere . 
i tried zahav for the first time with my bf during restaurant week and so glad i did ! i am a big fan of middle eastern mediterranean cuisine and this is as good as it gets ! first of all , i must say i was impressed with the service . all the staff were very friendly and accomodating . water was always filled and plates and utensils were changed after each course . the starters included hummus-tehina with fresh baked laffa bread and salatim ( N salads ) . the hummus was creamy , smooth and so good with the light and fluffy laffa . all of the N salads in the salatim were so yummy and flavorful tabouli ( parsley salad ) , cucumber tomato salad , spaghetti squash , fennel salad , spiced carrots , spicy okra , pickled cauliflower , and twice cooked eggplant . based on the reviews here i had to try the crispy haloumi and fried cauliflower . the crispy and salty of the cheese paired so well with the sweetness of the date jam . i also really enjoyed the chive , dill , mint and garlic sauce that went with the cauliflower . next was the balkan pastel , which had tender shredded lamb inside a warm flaky pastry crust , and chraime , tender moroccan fish stew in a tangy broth of tomatoes and peppers . for the main courses , we had the romanian ( tender chunks of steak with eggplant and yummy red sauce ) and the jaffa ( branzino fish served with crispy salted skin and bulgur pilaf ) . by the time these came , we were already on the verge of full , despite the small size of the dishes . our two desserts were amazing too ! the labaneh panna cotta was soft , sweet and creamy served with a tart passionfruit sherbet and a mildly sweet pistachio baklava . the chocolate semifreddo was like a combination of chocolate mousse and ice cream together . everything was so delicious and we walked away quite full , along with our bonus baggies of cookies , zatar seasoning and coupons ! definitely will be coming back to try more dishes ! 
the waitress came over and asked for more tip . what . the . f . oh did i mention hair in food ? " usually people give N tip , this isn ' t enough " " are you asking for more tip ? " " yes " " you don ' t ask for more tip . " " . . . " 
great decor , good food , wine very , very over priced . will not rush back . 
hi ! stopped in by myself one night after work for a nice meal . i felt welcomed , it wasn ' t over crowded and the service was nice . bread came with my meal , ordered a diet coke , and had penne arrabbiata tomato , basil , roasted garlic and spicy red pepper . it was truly delicious . . . i had to finish it and didn ' t take any home ! good prices , for the quality of food that you get , the attentive and welcoming service , peaceful atmosphere , and bread . . . etc . there was a family with toddlers next to me , and another family with teenagers . so , seems welcoming to all ages . could also be a nice data , romantic place . casual enough for nothing over the top , but romantic enough w good food for something special . enjoy ! 
after reading such rave reviews about this vendor ' s falafel , i was excited to try it for myself . i was very disappointed after the first bite . the falafel were soggy and overly salty . the onion slices were very thick and any bite with it had an overpowering onion-y flavor to it . the white sauce had no taste to it . also , i ' m not a fan of pickles and was surprised to find them in my wrap . the pita was the best part of the wrap to be honest- it was soft but not chewy . the fact that i did not eat the wrap right away or the very hot weather might have played a role in my sub par eating experience , but i also suspect that the falafels i was served were not fresh ( i was told to wait a few minutes for falafels and saw one worker putting more in the oil and just a second later , my wrap was ready , before the freshly dropped ones were fetched from the oil ) . seeing that this vendor has so many followers , i may give it another shot in the future , but not any time soon . 
great lunch spot if you work in the area - lots of space . the food actually tastes quite good and they comes fairly quickly . the spinich dip is delicious ! ! ! just wish the restaurant had a little more personality . . . 
i love atticus . i really do . it ' s right near two museums and is the perfect place to go for a delicious sandwich or to search for a new read . in atticus you can always find something unique to make you think . so why , you might ask , has such a frequent customer given it a lackluster N star rating ? -the bookstore might be good to browse , but finding anything specific requires a degree in something that i just have not studied . if you know what you want walk a few blocks down to the yale bookstore . -the service isn ' t very good . the waiters waitresses tend to talk to a spot right over your left ear rather than talking to you , and the food is pretty pricey considering they make all their own breads and desserts . 
i ' ve been wanting to try this place for quite some time given the stellar yelp reviews . after finally squeaking through the door last night just before N pm , i can now say i agree with its good reputation ! it is truly a gem in the neighborhood . i love that it is byob . at N . N a plate , sky cafe boasts street food prices , but the dining area is nicer than i expected given the cheap prices it ' s clean , comfortable , and well-decorated . although my friend had to take my order over the phone at N N as i rushed there before closing , the waiter was patient and excellent at recommending a vegetarian dish i would enjoy . he was very helpful and polite and he never made us feel rushed . now , on to the food . everything was fresh and arrived speedily to the table . my friends both got the mie kepiting ( homemade egg noodles with crab meat ) . the noodles were phenomenal a delightful and unique combination of texture and flavor . the noodles and crab meat are in one bowl , and the broth is served on the side , so you can pour it in to suit your ideal ratio of noodles broth . i got the nasi urap with what were described to me as " stinky beans " ( i did not find them very stinky at all , which is a good thing ) . the beans came in a rich , spicy , coconutty sauce that i absolutely adored . the plate came with a nest of assorted crispy fried vegetables , which complimented the texture of the beans and rice perfectly . i was a little disappointed there were not more vegetarian items on the menu , considering the many vegan options available at other indonesian restaurants in the area , but apparently they can make several dishes to order , so i would love to come back and try a vegetarian version of the noodles if they have it . i ' m so glad i finally tried this place ! i ' ll be back for sure . 
i found egan sons on the internet when i searched for restaurants in the west orange area that serve sticky toffee pudding . my husband and i went for the first time tonight . he ordered the salmon - medium - and said it was perfect ( although done which is what he likes ) . it was a large portion of salmon which made him very happy . he said the spinach was garlicky and awesome and the sweet potato fries were great and he wants to go back again and again . i ordered the " toasties - reuben " which were N toasted reuben sandwiches and were also quite good . however , i was very disappointed in the sticky toffee pudding which was not very moist tonight . i admit to being spoiled having it in scotland many times . tonight ' s didn ' t even really taste like it did before . so i would go back again and again , but i probably won ' t order the sticky toffee pudding again . 
we were taken here by a family member who lives in nyc . it was busy and we waited N minutes . the owner personally greeted us and the service was excellent . i have never had ethiopian food and really enjoyed it . we ordered chicken combination dishes and beef combination dishes . we were able to try all the vegetarian dishes as different sides . after the great food , we tried two desserts the apple tart and a mocha chocolate bake . i was blown away and hope that they stay busy and open . there were very yummy and quality ! i highly recommend this place ! 
what a hidden gem ! it ' s located right next to the famous grimaldi ' s but what most people don ' t know is that this place is owned by patsy grimaldi . thus , you can skip the long lines at grimaldi ' s and come here . i went on a sunday at N pm and there was no wait , unlike grimaldi ' s which had about N people lined up on the sidewalk . our server was extremely friendly and attentive . we ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious . although they should technically be the same , i enjoyed it a lot better than when i ate at grimaldi ' s , which is still good also . 
service was horrible . worst i have ever experienced . 
love the caribbean flounder - amazing . consistently good , fun place to go , especially in the warmer months - can eat outside . 
i ' ve been a long-time customer at this restaurant , and it seems they still don ' t find it important to value customer loyalty . my last two visits prompted me to create this account just so i can write this review . waiting N minutes for my meal wasn ' t bad enough but receiving the meal with a hair in it being charged a crazy amount ( as much as a beer ) for refills of soft-drinks ( which were topped off with ice ) and the server admitted that our order was mixed up with a take-out order , they didn ' t show the least bit of empathy for us having waited on their mistake not even a verbal apology . this left us feeling unappreciated as customers , and especially as ones that have been going to this restaurant for half a dozen years ! ! ! i ' ve brought so many friends to this restaurant , because yes , they do make good food . but treating your customers as purely cash-cows , you could be serving the best caviar and most expensive campaigns for free , and i still wouldn ' t come . 
wow . . they ' ve really gone down . . not impressed with the new chefs or wait staff at all . chefs eating the food ( . with their hands ) as they ' re cooking . chefs are touching each others faces with their hands in the middle of cooking food . ok maybe this happens at other places but we just don ' t get to see it . . . but i can see you here ok ? chefs are checking their dirty germ-covered phones in between cooking in front of people and touching the food they ' re going to cook for people too . ugh really ? ? ? skeeved no thanks . if i ' m in the area again will prob check out pure good and wine next door . . . geez . . . also food wasnt that good and neither was service . even bathroom was smelled like pee . really disappointed . will come back in N months . hopefully things will change . 
best pizza ever ! love going here with the kids on sundays
love this place ! wonderful food and drinks ! 
we tried multple delivery places when we moved to west hartford and this is our favorite . they give you the best food and largest portions for the price . they are also connected to i love sushi . i ' m not a sushi fan , but my wife is . they allow you to order from both places for delivery , so it works out well . the sushi is a little underwhelming , but it ' s a great bonus if you are already ordering standard chinese . 
my second visit was every bit as good as my first . plain and simply this is foodie nirvana . 
just as great as the other locations . i love greenpoint east williamsburg and am stoked that xi ' an is out here killing it . 
love this place
i just happened to look for a restaurant to go to prior to the entertainment of the robin hood foundation ' s benefit last week , and came across scarpetta , and their N year anniversary menu . at first , i thought i wouldn ' t get a reservation , since the original N N seating i saw was gone within N minutes , but after refreshing the page several times , it came back up , and of course i had to take it , since there wasn ' t an opening again until the end of the week . it was a little difficult to find , mainly because we were walking on the opposite side of the street , and the sign saying " scarpetta " can really only be seen on the same side . however , they did have large numbers for the street address , which made it easier to find from the opposite side , after i had to look up the address . we came in and sat at the bar , and glanced at their drink menu . i wasn ' t really feeling a drink , but my bf got a captain and ginger , and i just got a soda , which ended up being about N . we were seated in one of the booth chair set ups . i didn ' t think the booth would be as comfortable as it was , since it appeared to be at a N degree angle , but it wasn ' t too bad . the decor was really nice and home-y very comfortable to sit in . the best part was the sunroofs that were open , allowing fresh air and sunshine in . we chose from the N year anniversary menu , because we were able to try many items all at once . i had the creamy polenta , spaghetti , duck breast , and chocolate cake . he had the yellowtail , short rib and bone marrow agnolotti , black cod , and mango and white chocolate napoleon . everything was absolutely amazing . the creamy polenta was served separately from the mushrooms , which was nice because i was able to add as i ate , rather than mix all at once . the spaghetti was to die for . . . simple , but very tasty . the duck was cooked perfectly , and the chocolate cake was very rich too . i had a cup of coffee , which helped wash it down . the yellowtail was very nice , the salt on top gave a nice texture and taste contrast . the agnolotti was very smooth and rich in flavor . the black cod was great crispy skin with a moist , tender texture to the fish . i saved the best for last . i think the napoleon was impeccable . the mango mousse was full of mango flavor , and they provided thin sheets of white chocolate , which balanced with the mango . i appreciated the fact that despite being a prix fixe menu , they did not mess up the quality of the food that came out . everything was excellent . it was pretty quiet , even when the dining room was N N full , which was nice , so we didn ' t have to yell across the table . it was also cool to see bob tuschman , from the food network , also in the restaurant . to me , it said that this restaurant is good , if he enjoys going there too . all in all , we will definitely be back . i cannot wait for the spaghetti and napoleon again ! 
it is good ambiance in good neighborhod . food is good but not great . i would advise you to go there if you want something cool in the neighborhood , with good food and good lights
this is my favorite restaurant in the city . let me explain why . first , the maialino al forno , which they have every night as a special is the most delicious thing i have ever put in my mouth . ever . i dream about it at night . the pork is so tender and flavorful and literally melts in your mouth . it ' s enough to split with a few people , and an absolute must . the service is fantastic . we had a large party with no reservations , and they had a waitress serve us wine and champagne while we waited . so unnecessary , but so sweet ! it made us feel wanted and special , and made the wait ( which was only an hour ) seem like nothing . the meat appetizers we had were wonderful , and the waitress brought our islamic friend olives for free since he could not eat the pork -- again , so sweet and accomodating ! we split the pork special i love and mentioned above , and the rabbit cacciatore , which was delicious , although a little tough ( which is normal for rabbit ) . we finished off our meal with gelato , most of us getting the tiramisu , which actually tasted and was served like tiramisu . i asked the waitress to spike my coffee with bailey ' s , and she did with pleasure . the management and service here make the food taste even better than it already does . this is my go-to restaurant now because it feels like going to a family member ' s home for a meal . 
i love this joint ! i think it ' s a great sandwich spot and love that it ' s owner operated , not a chain . the owners are cheery , and have very busy hands . we ate lunch here yesterday and a steady stream of people came in while we were there . it ' s clearly popular , and it ' s popular because everything is fresh , the people behind the counter are fabulous and it ' s a great deal ! as an aside , i especially like that they actually close for a short period of time to go on vacation each year . just further underscores that the owners are committed to their business , but also know the value of taking a break to refresh and rejuvenate . 
sushi house N is a wonderful dining experience . the restaurant is beautiful and the service is flawless . i highly recommend the scallop rosette as an appetizer and the chocolate peanut butter dessert . we were thrilled when the restaurant presented us with an extra special dessert to acknowledge our anniversary . thank you . 
taste good malaysian cuisine is the best ! ! ! ! i ' ve been trying a few malaysian ' s restaurant both in manhattan chinatown and queens . this is the only place i go for authentic malaysian food after i have checked in the hotel in the city . most customer are locals and not many tourist know about this place . love their hainanese chicken rice , curry noodles , char kuey teow , kangkung belacan , bubur cha cha , pulut hitam and homemade herbal drink . their price is reasonable too ! service is a lot better than the rest of the malaysian restaurant in town . i can ' t wait for my next trip to new york ) 
great new addition to the south slope -- it ' s rare that a restaurant offers risotto on their menu , this place has over half a dozen risottos to choose from ! the seafood risotto is perfect . the grilled calamari were sublime the first time and unfortunately rubbery the next . . . pastas are fantastic too , done in true italian fashion . the place is cute and small , possibly a bit too noisy for an intimate dinner when it gets busy weekend nights . definitely check this one out . 
all the previously wonderful experiences i ' ve had at gt aside , i went this evening for dinner at the bar and didn ' t make it past the first drink . i came in around N Np tonight and was pleasantly acknowledged by the host . i told him i was going to have a drink at the bar and he said ' welcome . ' so far so good . i found a spot right away where two guys had been eating and drinking . in front of me , two empty wine glasses , two empty water glasses , two place mats and two used napkins . in other words , the bar needed to be cleared and wiped down of crumbs . i waited . and i waited some more . ten minutes passed and not a single server approached me much less cleaned up the dirty debris . a woman sitting two seats over leaned over and commented on the lack of service she noticed the oversight who wouldn ' t have ? i was being snubbed . there were two bartenders making drinks , chatting it up with customers and a manager-type hanging back there too . i was curious how long it would take before someone took notice that i was waiting for a little attention in what has always been , in my experience , a very well run restaurant . i resolved not to raise my hand , voice or make some sort of visual plea for service . at the point that i was about to bolt , a woman bartender came over and started removing some of the dirty glassware and asked if i knew what i wanted . no warmth , no apology no personality . i told her i ' d like to see a drink menu and she handed one over . i should have left but after flipping through the binder of offerings settled on one of their N house cocktails . it was okay . i had planned to spend a couple of hours here N-N drinks , dinner , etc . i left after one drink . 
delicious ! ! we ordered mussels , cheese dish and potato latke for appetzers . it was all good but the potato latke with salmon tartar was a real standout . the duck breast we got was also yammi , it melted in your mouth . i really wanted to try their bread pudding since i heard it was also good , but didn ' t have enough space in my belly . highly recommend this place , also very romantic . 
this place is my new favorite ! the food is so delicious and fresh . great choices to choose from . everything had such great flavor . i can see that this will be my lunch spot at least N times a week if not more . staff was friendly and nice , even giving me suggestions when i was undecided because of all the choices available . can ' t wait to go back and try some more things i missed out on . the steak taboon was so good , as was the eggplant . hummus and israeli salad . to top it off , the place was spotless ! did i mention freshly baked pitas ? ! ? soooo good ! don ' t forget the baklava for dessert ! yummmmmmmyyyyyyyy ! ! ! 
hello everyone ) yes , this is didier , the chef owner of la sirene . . . . for the Nst time , i go public to say that we are not perfect and mistakes happens ! c ' est la vie . . . and if you are not listed on my opentable electronic book . . . then , it ' s impossible to fit in this tiny little modest beyond modest hole in the wall . . . . ! ! ! this kind of situation is happening twice since may N and is my worst nightmare . the customer is always right , but in the case of mr chattaram he didn ' t have time to become a customer and his party responded to me from a different name ! well , i am french after all and may not understand all about it . sure it ' s my fault anyway ! but his review is not to be taken as reference ! thanks for taking the time to read the blogs ( lol ) by the way , you will excuse my napoleonic modesty but i rate myself N stars if you don ' t mind ) ) ) love to you all . didier . 
your standard neighborhood joint . you ' ll fine people dressed up and in jeans . the roasted chicken is delicious and the vegetables that accompany it are always in season . brunch is great , but can get crowded . try the steal cut oats with vanilla infused milk and dried fruit . it is like desert for breakfast , but healthier . their omelets are also great and with a side of sausage , it is even tastier . friendly service , but can get loud because a lot of families with children eat here . 
wanted to go to the italian restaraunt next door ( with a very similar name ) but it was closed . came here instead and glad we did ! they have a large menu , and the food is excellent . i had the chicken devanto ( chicken murphy ) and was very happy with it . the only item i think was less than stellar was the tiramisu , which has too much cream and not enough lady fingers , but otherwise everything was great . 
good for what it is , a casual pizza spot with a good selection of tasty pizzas and a bar . the remainder of the menu is pretty limited . how places still manage to get a liquor license in wayne is beyond me but i was thankful for their N peroni " game day " drafts on the sunday we went . they also have N N price craft beers on mondays tuesdays . outdoor seating in wayne is a bonus , even if it ' s right on the parking lot . we sat outside on a cool , clear early september night and we enjoyed it . we watched the sun set over party city across the other side of route N . . . romantic . we had a N N broccoli sausage and N N white pie . both were tasty and satisfying . we tried a small order of their famous meatballs - they were good , but not as good as my homemade balls ) the inside dining room seems really loud , based on the acoustics of the room give it a try , especially on a night they have drink specials . the wings looked good , will try them next time . 
i still love this spot , but its so out of my way . . west philly . . but parking -when you get there is easy , all around-since its residential . parked right in front . meeting my brunch buddy . they serve le columbe coffee-which is always a plus , she got us on list for dining area , finally we got seated . we ordered the croissant french toast with strawberry compoteand aside crispy bacon . . the owners waiters are still not as attentive , still slow . took couple trys to get my coffee refilled . like the place , the dining area , puts up paintings of local artists which you can purchase so they change every so often . love the eclectic feel . getting there is pain , unless your local . . nice spot to run in get your coffee or tea quick bite . . 
vitae ' s inviting , relaxed downtown feel stands out amongst the typical unapproachable , chaotic environs of midtown manhattan . the food is exceptional in both execution and flavor . standout dishes include the signature scallops w curry , octopus carpaccio , chestnut agnolotti , foie gras with plums , fried oysters , and duck breast . in short , almost everything we ordered . albeit not an inexpensive meal , vitae is a welcome departure from midtown mediocrity , and the quality of the meal merits the pricetag . 
this was first time for at luca ' s . the food was excellent . many of the pastas were freshly made . the portions were huge . the appetizers and salads are large enough for two people . this place is an excellent value given the quality of food and the excellent portions . 
i ' ll definitely go back here ! the food is great , and the couple that owns it is lovely and take good care of their customers . 
first of all , i ordered takeout and was told it would be N minutes . i arrived when they told me to pick up and i had to wait another N minutes just to get N bland boring rolls . they didn ' t even apologize for making me wait Nh N minutes and i got it on a slow tuesday night . there was no special sauces and the specialty rolls literally looked exactly the same as all the others but with a higher pricetag . i ' ve had much better sushi ( sumo sushi fat salmon ) within the same price range and will not be going here ever again . 
way overpriced for food that was good but wasn ' t great . party of N came out to close to N dollars . N of the ones in that party were children . i mean come on , N dollars for chicken alfredo and a little over N dollars for cheese ravioli ? it ' s a disgrace to charge that much for something so very simple . if you look at the money signs it states there are N when clearly it should be marked N because of their prices . don ' t try and drum up your business by charging outrageous prices but by offering great food at reasonable prices and you ' ll get more than enough business . 
oh ippudo , the third time is truly a charm . my first two attempts were a fail . N mins wait for one person during lunch and dinner ? no thanks . decor N . N N -holy crap this place is huge . i always thought it seated N people max but the dining area can def fit over N people service N . N N -very good at refilling water -they are very stern with people standing in the " high traffic " areas food N N -hirata chicken wings ( N pieces ) N , fried chicken wings glazed with ippudo special black pepper sauce was quite delicious but would reconsider trying a second time because N for N wings is a bit ridiculous but the sauce is yummy . at least try it once ! ( N N ) - pork hirata buns ( N pieces ) N was definitely the hype everyone has said . the sauce was just right but i felt like there was a tad bit too much mayo . i ' ll see if they can make it without mayo next time . ( N N ) -akamaru modern ( N ) came with thin noodles and two fatty pork chashu . the broth was not as creamy as i had expected but still flavorful enough for me to drink most of the broth . i was disappointed that a boiled egg was additional N where most ramen places include it and far cheaper . ippudo is a place to def try ramen if you ' ve never been but i do not get the craving to try it a second time . ( N N ) 
one of my fav byo sushi spot in the city ! only has a few tables so make a rezzi . 
half-price burger on wednesday was icing ! i would have paid full price for their burger . it was a rainy , cold night on N dec and the place was packed at Npm . the wait was enjoyable with a guinness . . . the wait staff was friendly and extremely helpful . 
i love this restaurant for its unique and tasty food and friendly owner and chef . if i had to label it i guess i ' d call the food " nouveau-haitian " . this is one of the area ' s very few non-asian places which cater to vegetarians without going off-menu . alternatively , the goat is great ! bon app tit . 
not sure how to review eataly as a whole . i can only say it is a must destination for food lovers and offers a variety of ways to enjoy it . where else can one grocery shop with a glass of red wine in your hand ? even if you don ' t eat there ( and warning - exceedingly popular and crowded ) , wandering through is a treat . 
what ' s not to love about this place ? i ' ve been coming for almost N years and it really never once disappointed . the menu is not extensive and yet i try new dishes here and there so not only are " my mainstays " so good that i almost never want to deviate but when i do i am pleasantly surprised ! apps you cannot go wrong with any of the crostini . my fav is the cannellini beans . meatballs are superb , as well the three salads they have on menu . pastas . look no further than the faiccos hot sausage and cavatelli . actually my fav pasta dish in nyc . sandwiches are also very good . italian tuna is aces and the eggplant with pecorino is as good as it gets . great wine list at very reasonable prices it ' s a five star restaurant that can also double as your " goto " neighborhood place . 
the artichoke tastes like campbells soup on a pizza . 
hypity hype hype ! with the over Nk reviews on yelp and everyone wanting to try this place- i had to give it a go as i was saying in east village for the weekend came in by myself and was seated right away ( score ) versus a twosome before me asked for wait time and it was over N hours ( yikes ) was seated at a table of N with other people in N somes enjoying their meal . lots of different selections of ramen , meat , etc got the highly recommended akamaru modern with the egg and pork . it was yummy and i ate all of it but living in the bay area its not anything more special than something i can get here . i still prefer katana-ya in union square in sf to this . i probably would have been disappointed if i waited super long but since i didn ' t then its all good . N bucks for a bowl of ramen ( N plus tip ) is def too pricey . 
this place is amazing ! seriously . the crowd is always really cool and kind . there ' s no assholes here . the food is moderately priced for the neighborhood but it tastes amazing . this is a gem in a neighborhood that ' s becoming what it never was . it ' s my new neighborhood favorite . 
i am eating as i write this . i only order delivery from kansai , which is way better than mizu or nara , and i have had the shrimp tempura roll , godzilla roll , spider roll and spicy tuna roll . the rolls are sloppy . the gozilla roll started to come a part as i ate it . the one cool this about kansai is their desert . i ordered their mochi ice cream and the fried cheesecake . the ice cream was interesting in a good way , the fried cheesecake was not . it was mushy and warm . ick
we went for restaurant week . the menu looked good , but unfortunately the food was not . the fried risotto balls with smoked cheddar tasted like the oil was almost rancid . the grilled chicken was dry and tasteless . the carrots along side the dish were so hard you couldn ' t cut them with a knife , and they were cooked ! the beef short ribs had a weird tasting sauce . and the desserts were bad too ! very disappointing . we will not go there again . 
i love this place . in spite of a recommendation from a trusted friend , i originally went with some trepidation . i ' d been to other all-you-can eat sushi places ( generally more expensive than this place ' s N ( N on weeknights ) and , as others have said here , those other places are typically very mediocre or else they made you wait a very long time to get a second helping ( one place even counted up your left-overs and charged you if you had too many pieces uneaten ! ) . since my first visit to sushi palace about N months ago , i ' ve been going here about N-N times per month ( alone , with my wife , with friends ) and the food has been consistently good . is it up to par with the very best sushi bars in ny ? no . but it also costs about a third ( or less ) of what those places charge and sp certainly hold its own against nearby stalwarts kanoko and shogun N ( and again , for significantly less money ) . the wait staff is not always on top of things ( although the manager ( and , i believe , owner ) jason is an absolute delight . . . always charming and helpful no matter how busy it is ) . about the only complaint i have about service is that , especially on a busy night , it ' s not uncommon for them to make small mistakes on your order . . . a wrong number of pieces , a missed handroll , on one occasion , something i hadn ' t asked for . this is no big deal , if you ' re really dying for the item they missed , let jason ( or , if you ' re sitting at the sushi bar , one of the sushi chefs know ) and they ' ll make sure you get the missing item post-haste . by the way , the assortment of fish is very large . this is not a place where you just get a choice of tuna , salmon , shrimp and yellowtail . you get those but also several other kinds of fish , almost all of it available as nigiri , sashimi , maki or handrolls . there ' s also a selection of almost a dozen specialty rolls ( don ' t miss the lobster mango roll with sweet chili sauce as a fabulous dessert sushi ! ) , most of which i ' ve found delicious . and don ' t forget that the " all-you-can-eat-sushi " price includes sashimi , small orders of tempura , teriyaki , various seaweed salads , dumplings , croquettes and more and i wonder how these guys keep going at this price ( not that i ' m complaining ! ) . there is a substantial menu of fixed price items to order from as well . i ' ve only ever done the all-you-can-eat thing ( which has it ' s own menu ) so i can ' t speak to the quality of the other dishes but i would expect it to be quite high . sushi palace does not serve alcohol so if you want wine ( or something else ) with your meal , bring your own and they ' ll gladly supply the corkscrews , glasses and even wine buckets . as for a couple of people here complaining " these reviews must be fake because the person hasn ' t written any other reviews . " that ' s just nonsense ! i did register for this site just to write this review but it ' s not because i ' ve got any vested interest in the restaurant . . . it ' s because i ' m so impressed with the place that i wanted to tell people about the place . and if you think they ' re fake , show up at sushi palace at N N or N N any friday or saturday night and see the people overflowing on to the sidewalk waiting as much as N-N hours to get in and ask yourself if fake reviews were doing that ! 
this has been my go to bar for the last few years . so i think i can give an honest review . i usually go for happy hour . the beer price and selection are excellent . the waitresses are for the most part extremely friendly and attentive . the food is typical bar food but better than average . i wish they didn ' t charge cover on the weekends but i guess they have to pay for the band . the cover bands are not really my thing . they have several themed nights ( trivia on tuesdays ) that i ' ve attended . they have a ton of tv ' s with basically every worthwhile game on . in the summer time , you can drink on the patio and eat food ( something that egan ' s prohibits for some reason ) . i prefer jakes to egan ' s because the beer selection price is better and the bar dimensions are more spacious . all around , probably the best bar in montclair . 
this place is on par for an italian joint . while the food was pretty good ( not overly amazing ) , the service was just okay . the portion size of the pasta primavera was ample , but the spaghetti with sausage was mostly just angel hair ( very little sauce ) . great ambiance , despite the photos of tragedies that befell hartford , which line the walls . 
N . N star . started with a caesar salad and pumpkin scallops which was average . for the entree ordered the black label burger which was one of the best ( if not the best ) burgers i ever had . it was great and just melted in your mouth . the service was great too . the only negative is the tables are small so it can feel a little cramped . 
i went to london grill the other night with a friend . we arrived around Npm and the place was relatively busy , but we were promptly seated . this is my second time to lg ( i ' ve previously been here for brunch with the parents ) . honestly , i ' ve had no problem with the service . our particular server seemed overwhelmed , so another waiter stepped in to help her . our meals were served fairly quickly - within N minutes of ordering . after a N hour shift at work , i had the best meal of the day at lg . i ordered the roast bbq pork which came with collard greens and macaroni and cheese . it ' s easy to screw up collard greens , but these were tender with a spicy vinegar punch . the pork was cooked to perfection - moist with no hint of gristle . the barbecue sauce was equally tasty and didn ' t evoke the flavors of bottles sauces one bit . the macaroni was also delicious . they smartly avoiding " dressing " it up and stuck with ooey-gooey cheese and tender elbow noodles . my friend was equally pleased with his fish and chips . their selection of beer is pretty impressive and this is one of the few places that seems to carry strongbow cider ( which they serve in a huge glass ) . needless to say , we had a great time . the atmosphere is inviting and the atrium is a great place to sit even in the winter . jeff is a great bartender and i was glad to have john and brighid as our servers . i ' ve definitely had no problems with service here . 
very decent pizza even the slice that slid to the side of the box . and super fast delivery . 
its just the best food cart in the city
we made a reservation for dinner on christmas day back in november for our party of N . the restaurant cancelled our reservation N days in advance ( december Nrd ) because they decided to close the place for the holidays all of a sudden . they probably didn ' t get enough reservations or something . . . they tried to reach us by phone , but my phone didn ' t work properly in the us . so we got a cancellation email from open table . it didn ' t really matter that they could ' t reach us by phone , as they were cancelling on us anyway . we were very dissapointed . being belgians ourselves , we were looking forward to having our christmas dinner here . . . 
what a fantastic place . great ambiance . amazing food . nice drinks . service is great too . i keep going there again and again to eat the matador combo . prices are reasonable too . 
i love this place . seriously . sooo much better than chipotle , qdoba , and moes . the ingredients are fresh and the food takes me right back to california . the steak burrito is a must have . 
best philadelphia cheese steak hands down ! the others are good but in my opinion genos is at the top of the top . not only do they have the best cheese steaks but there cherry peppers in the condiment section are the best i have ever tasted ! i wish i lived closer i would eat there everyday ! 
i went to jake ' s sandwich board the other day and left completely satisfied . while i was looking at their menu my mouth was watering because it all sounded so good . i ended up ordering their signature sandwich jake and got the combo with fries and a coke . they definitely don ' t cheat you on the portion and you even get refills on the coke ' s . i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great philly cheese steak or just a good sandwich in general . i know i will be going back . 
whether you are looking for something on the healthier side or some comfort food this place seems to have something for everyone . the menu is very extensive and adaptable to your taste and dietary restrictions whether you are vegetarian or in need of celiac options . they offer rice penne as well as rice linguine for the pasta dishes for gluten-free diets as well as whole wheat pasta if you are just trying to eat on the healthier side . although all the dishes are great , make sure you try the ants on a tree and the j . k . ' s pasta . also be prepared for left overs , which can ' t possibly be a bad thing . 
well , firstly the best veggie burger that you can imagine , where you can create your own toppings etc it ' s absolutely yummy . . . my waitress alyssa was not only super friendly but made me feel like a superstar vip and not just like a guest . . . i ' m going to go as far as to say that she is the best waitress i ' ve had . . . super cool . cody the bartender is outstanding and could put tom cruise to shame in ' cocktail ' what a great bloke ! this place is amazing and i will certainly be coming back on a regular basis . if you don ' t check this place out , then shame on you ! 
just horrible ! service was ok but the food was just awful . the couvert , antipasti , main dish . went there looking for a good italian food and it was a big disappointment . 
i really don ' t get all the hype about this place . yes , it ' s cheap , and yes , the food is decent , but i definitely would not go out of my way to come here again . had spicy beef noodle soup and the shredded pork and pickled mustard tuber soups . the broth in the spicy beef was pretty good , the pork broth less so , but the noodles in both were overcooked and lacked the springy chewiness of good noodles . i would give this place fewer stars , but the dumplings ! o the dumplings . absolutely delicious-- silky and luscious , slightly sweet and mysteriously spiced . N for a plate of N and the tastiest morsel the shop produces . 
we ate here for the first time and had a great experience . the food was great - we had the trout salad , duck salad , lamb with red beans and rice and chicken wings . the spicy beef jerky was also really tasty and just spicy enough . recommended ! the wait staff were great and attentive in just the right way . 
mixed feelings , the food was ok . several people with our party tried the dozer challenge . that was disappointing . one person was able to finish but the restaurant didn ' t have any t-shirts on hand that they advertise . your name is supposed to go on a placque but they say they wait until the end of the year to add names . however i didn ' t even see a placque with any names on it from previous years ? ? ? ? 
so delicious . i was beyond excited to hear an actual food truck was coming to northern liberties . . . because we ' re seriously lacking in that area . the guys that are working are really funny and relaxed and the dogs they ' re serving are sooo good ! i got the coney island express and my boyfriend got two of the specials from today and we were both very happy with our selections . i honestly look forward to being supremely drunk in the future and ordering ' whatever on a roll ' past Nam . ! 
found hair in the salad and half cooked " fully cooked " dish ! would never go again . tricked by other reviews here . i believe the other reviewers are somehow associated with the restaurant . 
good authentic thai restaurant . 
bxl zoute is a great place to have lunch or dinner and i surely enjoyed a good belgian beer here . they have a wide selection of draft beer and good knowledge of each one which they happily share . they even stored my luggage during the day and gave me a good and fast lunch before heading to the airport . service was excellent . when i ' m back in nyc , i ' ll go back for sure , love it there ! 
i ' ve been to a lot of pubs . i ' ve been here N times over the course of a decade . this is not a pub . it ' s more like a frankenstein mix of a charlie browns steakhouse and dive bar . while the place a appears clean the dive bar atmosphere comes more into play when you encounter the staff which have an " i don ' t want to be here " attitude . maybe some of them have papers to write ( due to its proximity to msu ) . perhaps they are having baby-momma drama and that ' s why they can ' t be bothered to refill your drink or get you ketchup for your burger . the food is not bad but not worth feeling like an inconvenience . the reason why this place and a lot of crappy establishments in montclair stay open is because montclair state university is a dry campus . thus , desperate stressed out university staff , faculty and students go there to drink . if msu had a bar on campus , there would be for lease signs on the windows . 
my friends and i had just come back from the beach on a rainy day in jeans and wet clothes and walked into scarpetta . oh shit . i just tagged along not knowing it was a ' you better look good or else we ' re going to seat you in the back ' kind of restaurant . well , we got put into the back of the restaurant . but that doesn ' t mean that we weren ' t treated like everyone else . the service was good . the place was beautiful . the food was pretty good , but it didn ' t amaze me . we had five dishes split between us branzino with winter truffles spaghetti with tomato and basil roasted sirloin moist-roasted capretto roasted chicken i ' m not a pasta fan . i ' m not a fan of plain pasta either . i was appalled of paying N for spaghetti , but i ' m not going to lie , it was really good . the pasta was fresh and al dente and the sauce was really good . it was a bit salty , but i felt like it matched the texture of the spaghetti really well . i would pay for it again ! d the other dishes were nothing notable - i felt like they were expensive dishes that you could get elsewhere . and . . . the branzino was just downright gross . it tasted a bit like bleach as andrew c . has previously noted . 
i went to this restaurant on tuesday with my cousin , and it was amazing ! we ordered the ' thai iced tea ' which was yummy ( must have ) , and had some wonderful thai dishes which were bursting with flavour . it is a little crowded , but its certainly worth the visit , and we didn ' t have to wait to get a table . the restaurant has a gothic chic decor , and we had no idea there was so much more room at the back ! service was courteous and prompt , and i would definitely go back there again ! 
ok , so this place had me at biscuits and gravy . let me add that the smothered eggs biscuits and gravy is very good . the cajun bloody mary is a nice spicy twist on this classic brunch cocktail . we will be back for brunch again . 
place is great for a quick burger on the go . has excellent shakes and the amount of soda choices is incredible . 
worst service ever ! i arrived with a party of N for a corporate dinner . we over estimated and told the hostess to seat N . they don ' t take reservations so we had to wait for a bit . no problem there we were waiting for N in our party to come in from the parking lot . we tell the hostess our party is there and we sit at our tables ( our party was too large for one table , so they set up a table of N and a table of N . ) so then she says that she ' d like to consolidate the tables which is impossible because the table of N is a tight fit and she had told us previously , when we asked , that she could not add another table because there was no room . ( so you can extra chairs to an already small table ? ! ) needless to say we told her that we ' d be fine with the two tables . now that we ' re seated the waitress says to us that our entire party isn ' t here because we have open seats . i tell her that two went to the bathroom and another colleague mentions that we have a party of N and not N . well then she says we ' ve been " misled " and that their policy is to seat " whole " parties only . she said that because everyone wasn ' t together we would have to get up and go back to the waiting area until they are done in the bathroom before we can be seated again . you can imagine the reactions to that statement seeing as how we had already done our waiting and were already seated . some of us were already eating chips and salsa as well ! of course we said surely you can let us slide for two people and consider the fact that N of us are already seated . but this woman just wouldn ' t budge ! another colleague of mine suggested to her that we would take our business elsewhere . she told us to go right ahead ! she was sooo rude ! needless to say this was my first and last time at this place ! 
at grand opening and they are giving free samples of dessert and kimchi . kimchi isn ' t my thing . . but biminbap is my thing . the ingredients are fresh and it looks delightful . but we were a little disappointed the hot stone version is not available during lunch . otherwise , it was an interesting experience . . prices were a little high . . . otherwise , i ' d come back more often . 
ordered late at night , it took N minutes to bring me a couple of slices which looked like they had been sitting around since noon . burned around the edges , dried up , tasteless . i took three bites and threw everything in the trash . they need to just say " no , we don ' t deliver late at night " . 
awesome place for seafood lovers ! came here with a big group reservations are a must . ordered a bit of everything on the seafood side by pound . we also got the wings which was okay some us said it was salty . the chicken finger basket was actually better than the wings . don ' t get the catfish was kinda soggy when it came out . 
N dumplings for N . it doesn ' t get any better than that . i ordered that with a won ton soup . . . and i was full for N . N . ridiculous ! and i thought eating cheap and well in ny doesn ' t exist . the place is so freaking small , lots of yelling and chaos going on , but the cashier seems to know what ' s going on amidst the havoc . they should have a better ordering system because it just gets so confusing . the people working in the back are like robots ! i don ' t think they ever get a break ! 
best cambodian sandwich place ive ever been too ! ! ! 
almost didn ' t go for valentine ' s eve , but we wound up here with a Npm reservation . of course it was packed but our table was waiting for us , and even though the place is quite smaller than i thought , they held our table . at first it was a little uncomfortable , but then the crowd began to thin out and we had more elbow room . the staff was very very nice . . . . on to the food , we ordered caipirinias , i particularly do not like them but was pushed by my date , and wow , turned out to be the best drink ever ! we ordered N appetizers , the sausage and yuca fries with aioli , to die for ! and the mussels , omg , so fresh , and no sand ! ! ! ! delicious ! our entrees were picanha -grilled sliced top sirloin . served with rice , beans , vinaigrette and farofa ( yuca flour seasoned with bacon . ) and feijoada completa-the brazilian national dish black bean stew with dried meat , pork , ribs , sausage and bacon . served with rice , farofa and sauteed collard greens . the picanha was so tender and juicy , couldn ' t have asked for more ! the feijoada , was excellent , if you like pork and beans , go for this , its awesome ! now on to the best part of the night , the maracuya ( passion fruit ) mousse . i swear if i weren ' t so full , i would have ordered another , omg its amazing , yes it is very sweet , but its dessert ! if you like passion fruit and dulce de leche , go for this ! so N appetizers , N drinks , N entrees and N dessert N , not bad for a great night ! i highly recommend this place if you find yourself in astoria . can ' t wait to go back ! ! ! ! ! 
if your in a hurry and starving , look no further--this is the best korean ' fast-food ' in nyc ! they also have instant pre-packed take out ! 
the smell of fresh bread when you walk in is amazing . they offer free samples of bread cut at least N " thick . try the cinnamon bread . ordered a chocolate brownie it must weigh N pound . 
ate hear for a quick snack around Npm the day before new years eve N ! i stumbled in after seeing grimaldi ' s had a line around the block . i had the pizza with arugula and prosciutto , it was amazing ! ! ! ! the staff was very friendly . i must have got there right on time as i was leaving it was packed and also started forming their line around the block . get there early or be prepared to wait . worth it , these people know pizza ! ! 
very good sushi , and an excellent value . wait service could be a little better , and the parking lot sometimes doesn ' t have any empty spaces . 
i like this place . the decor is ultra modern , even sleek , the service is good , and the cooking is above average . i understand they own a second place in chinatown and this is the offshoot . with szechuan cooking and some interesting fusion items , i ' m curious to see where things go . both times there , we had some problems with the food that was delivered , and then a friendly , helpful reaction from the manager but no movement to comp anything . the first time , we got a different appetizer than we ordered , ate most of it , then realized it was not what we ordered . we talked to the server and then received the correct one but were still charged for the first one . my friend wrote a yelp review and was offered a discount on her next visit , which was nice , but why charge us initially ? yesterday at lunch , we got there when it wasn ' t crowded and then it got really busy . our order went in before the rush and then took a very long time to come . i flagged the server and the food was delivered . the entree was lukewarm and the rice was cold . my friend ( N months pregnant ) ate hers , when she ' s hungry , she goes for it . i sent mine back with the request for them to pack it " to go " . we had already been there N minutes and i was due back at work for a meeting . the waiter was apologetic and i asked him to take my entree off the bill . he sent the manager over , who was nice , friendly , and who explained that their food lamp warmer had broken on monday and he indicated that they had taken care of me by giving my food as takeout . there was no offer to comp anything . i felt like he was playing a game to see if i would actually insist on a comp . i explained , again , that we had waited a long time , received cold food , that i didn ' t get to eat w . my friend . i said , " i don ' t want to pay for this takeout entree . " he agreed , without a fuss , but why did i have to push for this ? they had messed up in a big way . come on , guy , step it up ! ! i eat out all the time and i ' m a customer worth keeping . you have a great space and very good food , but you need to take care of customers , esp . when the delivery of the food falls short . might give it one more visit . 
came here last night for the last night of restaurant week with some friends . we were seated promptly , even though we came late . we did not order any drinks , but our server brought us a sample of some cocktail that was being featured , which was actually the only thing i did not like ( the taste of the cocktail ) . we ordered N different apps and i thought all of them were quite tasty , especially the cauliflower ! i will probably order the cauliflower next time i come here because i have never had cauliflower i enjoyed so much ! for my main i had the gnocchi , it was very unique and flavorful . i loved how all the different elements of the dish ( the cheese , the orange zest , the pine nuts , and the gnocchi ) work together so well . as per the recommendation of our serves , since there were four of us she suggested we get all four of the dessert choices and share them , and we did . my favorites were the cheesecake and the ashta as i love anything with rose water in it ! overall great dinning experience , and i will definitely come back here to try items from the regular menu . 
wow do these guys know how to make a good pizza . i heard about this place from a friend of mine that lives in dumbo . i came by their last friday and ordered a pie of pizza for me and my girl - the pizza was amazing , very well done , fresh and crispy . i will defiantly come back to this spot . ummmmmy . 
we were greeted warmly , and being early expected to have a drink at the bar . instead we were taken directly to our table . the restaurant is charming with a warm homey yet trendy earthy decor . all of the front windows of the restaurant open up to let in the warm summer air , which almost as good as sitting out side on the front porch dining area . our waitress was friendly and attentive , and service moved quickly . the food was awesome , and the flavor pairings interesting and flavorful . we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine that was good and not over priced . i was actually shocked there was any on the menu we could afford , there were dozens ! there was nothing to complain about , and i would love to go back . 
it ' s good yakitori but it ' s just funny how serious the chef takes it ( which is a good thing ) , the way they artfully turn the meat on a stick as if performing a tough act
came here for brunch . nice ambience , classy which i liked . with the class comes the higher prices . eggs benedict was alright . still searching for the perfect eggs benedict . if you know any , please message me ! ) 
great place . . . buffet is awesome and reasonable price . . . all indian food are good ( south or north ) . . . must go place . 
um , i ' m having trouble understanding how someone can say this is the best chinese food . got takeout from there , and everything was drenched in the same brown sauce . super greasy , no flavor whatsoever . i have a lot of leftovers from this place and plan on tossing them , as i have no desire to eat food from this place ever again . 
after several attempts i finally made it into penelope ' s cafe , and by making it in , i mean arriving at Nam on saturday and sitting at the end of the bar . i sat down with a big appetite for a hearty and delicious breakfast , but the only thing my stomach felt upon leaving was a feeling of dissapointment . 
we came here this morning around Nam . really small shop . the seats are right next to each other you could pick food off someone else ' s plate . but no matter , it was cozy . once we walked right in , we were told that they only served the full breakfast menu at Nam . at the moment , only croissants and such from their mini bakery display . we decided to sit around first , told them we would be ordering from the prix fixe N . N menu that includes oj and tea or coffee . they were ok that we waited another half hour and served us our oj and tea coffee first while we waited . service was prompt and polite , we like . he had the croque monsieur - home baked brioche , ham swiss cheese sandwich i had the eggs norwegian - poached egg , gravlox , english muffin hollandaise sauce he liked his sandwich which was crispy and yummy . i took only N bite so i can ' t really comment further . i liked my smoked salmon with poached eggs . when my dish came , i initially poked the english muffin - my standard routine when there is one served . it was rock hard when i poked it with the knife . i was disappointed . but but but , when i placed it in my mouth and chewed , it wasn ' t all that hard ! i ' ve had english muffins that were literally rock hard and when chewed , hurt your gums ! i was wary of this , but it proved that my poking doesn ' t reveal all ! the english muffin became chewy and yet crisp and held up well even though i soaked it with the yolk of the poached egg . most would break apart under the yolk , but this didn ' t . couldn ' t quite taste the smoked salmon , really , as it was very thin and just one slice placed beneath the egg . plus , i drenched the salmon and muffin in the egg yolk . . . and with the hollandaise sauce , the smoked salmon really had no chance at all . there was roasted potatoes as sides . we both thought it was a tad too salty . it wasn ' t that good either because it was a little mushy . all in all a very filling and satisfying breakfast . would return for more ! 
after a terrible experience at N olde , i came here and got great bar service . 
so damn good , i had to eat there a second time before i caught my flight . if you arrive there hungry , order the guacamole and chips . presentation and taste are very good . as for the empanadas , you can ' t go wrong . tasted so fresh , hot and delicious ( no need for a dipping sauce ) . the only difficult part was which ones to order . or just play it safe and order one of each . if you like a little spice try the reggaeton empanada . next was a chicken stew ( pollo guisado ) that was to die for . the meat was cooked to perfection and practically fell of the bone . the second time around i ordered more empanadas and tried a pork chop dish . again , cook to perfection being moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside . 
solid place . love that the food is grilled on a charcoal grill in the back of the dining room , beyond the bar . smells great , looks great and you can see your steak grilled while enjoying some wine ) 
i really liked the food , i will be back for sure . very welcoming ! 
i just used this venue for a work event for N people and couldn ' t be happier with the result ! being in california , i was nervous to choose a location in ny without visiting it first . i was drawn to bea because of the great location and the lovely pictures online . when i reached out to the owner , he was extremely helpful and accommodating . he even forwarded additional pictures for me to look at . leading up to the event , the owner answered all of my questions quickly and provided me with any additional support that i needed ( someone to work the door and check ids , slideshow capabilities , appropriate signs and a registration table for check-in ) . during the event , we had open bar and passed appetizers . all of the appetizers were amazing ! they were so delicious and i never once had to ask for more food to be passed . the entire staff was really on top of it and made sure every guest had food and drinks . the event was going so well that we decided to extend it for an extra N minutes and the owner made sure to accommodate us . after the party was over , my friends and i stayed to have a few drinks and try a few other items from the menu . ( i definitely recommend the mac and cheese , it ' s delicious . ) not only was this a great place for a large party , it was also had a great atmosphere for a smaller group . i would definitely recommend this place for any sort of party , big or small , or even for a quiet dinner . this was my second time in new york and i ' ve explored several different restaurants each time . this was by far the best location atmosphere food service i ' ve had in ny . i will definitely use this venue again in the future . 
i went saturday night and the food was fantastic . sevice was good . the place was definitely loud but the food was so good that you didn ' t even mind . great salad . great fish . 
i was visiting ny and was meeting a group of friends for dinner . i wasn ' t sure from the reviews if this was going to be a tourist hell hole or what ? because of the location . but the food was fantastic . every dish was got was awesome and huge . a must try while in ny . very busy . 
a comida realmente muito boa e e os pratos deste restaurante chegam a servir N pessoas ! isso mesmo N pessoas ! extremamente fartos e bem preparados . a carta de vinhos tima tamb m . os " appetizers " tamb m s o gigantes e sugiro que pe a para dividir com a mesa toda . o ponto negativo o atendimento . sei que nos eua a pressa de atender grande , mas neste local especificamente passaram dos limites . enquanto ainda n o t nhamos acabado de comer , tiraram os nossos pratos . o gar om que nos atendeu foi extremamente grosso e tudo que ele ia trazendo na mesa , ele jogava . quando trouxe a conta e pagamos em dinheiro , ele n o voltava nunca com o troco e havia presumido que ir amos deixar tudo de gorjeta pra ele . est vamos em N pessoas e ningu m da mesa achou justo deixar mais do que N devido ao p ssimo atendimento que tivemos . a comida valeu muito a pena e o atendimento na parte do bar , enquanto aguard vamos a mesa , foi excelente ! 
boves rules ! sort of like eating at a dinner because of the funny environment , but i love it there . it is cozy , quick and delicious ! the food is so good and they do no skimp out on the sauce ! 
i can ' t say enough positive things about my experience at ngam . i was planning a large birthday party for N people and was nervous about finding a restaurant that would accommodate our needs while still keeping costs reasonable . ngam went above and beyond all of my expectations . first , chef hong took the time out to design a one of a kind menu including many vegetarian options as well as a signature cocktail for all the guests . the sheer variety of food was unbelievable given the price point including N kinds of appetizers ( the pomelo salad is surprising and unique , the spring rolls are crunchy and delicious , to name a few ) . the main courses started coming and it felt as though they never stopped . from roasted chickens to lobster in coconut milk to mussel stew to steak , pad thai and beyond , the menu was thoughtful , abundant and delicious . everyone walked away beyond satiated and we even wrapped up food to go ( not able to bear the thought of any of it going to waste ) . for dessert , we were only meant to have one chocolate fondue to share in honor of the birthday celebrations , but again , hong went beyond our agreement and also brought out smaller plates of fondue for people to share as well as a second round of drinks for everyone . service wise , the communication with the restaurant was incredibly friendly and flexible . when i had to add or subtract numbers from the guest list or let them know that some people would be arriving late , there were no arguments are haggling . the hostess event coordinator stayed in constant communication with me via email in the days leading up to the party . also , while the long table in the center is meant for a party of N , hong was nice enough to give us the entire table so even though there were other diners , it felt like a private party . servers were buzzing around our table , but gave us ample time to enjoy all the food and also walk around the space and chat . chef hong even came out several times to check in on us . finally , hong staff were sweet enough to give me a birthday card thanking me for choosing their restaurant for my party and offering me a complimentary bottle of wine for the next time i dine there . all in all , i have never experienced a restaurant in ny such as ngam . oftentimes organizing a large party can be stressful and frustrating , but this was the most pain-free , if not exciting experience i had . the level of creativity and execution made it clear that they were excited to put out a great meal for us which is a rare quality to find these days in new york . thank you to everyone at ngam for making it a memorable event ! ! 
bunch of retarded posts about this restaurant from people who hasn ' t eaten enough real sushi to know . let me lay some truth in the table . sitting here with gf after a disgusting order of N sashimi pieces ( N eN on menu ) . tuna was absolutely rotten i had to spit it out , not that it wasn ' t fresh , just straight up old sushi . the white tuna was harder than rubber . unbelievable that they can get away with this . i ' m considering calling for an inspection on this place . we informed the asian waitress and she muttered ' oh ' and walked away . no followup . it ' s inconceivable how anyone has given this place a positive rating . my best advice is to go to kazumi across the street . you get free sake too and sushi that won ' t give you food poisoning . absolutely a joke for a japanese sushi joint . 
bibou was the most wonderful experience i have had in a philly restaurant . the food is absolutely amazing . the ambiance is great - it has such a nice feel - you can laugh and have a great time , not stuffy at all . from the moment we walked in the door we felt at home . the bone marrow is not to be missed - we had this for the table and i believe it was the best thing on the menu . we went at N N and they were already buzzing with a dinner crowd . 
every sandwich i ' ve had here was the best ! the signature red onion sandwich is out of this world ! ! --hot turkey , apple slices , tomato mayo , smoked gruyre red onion on homemade bread-- outstanding ! 
cute atmosphere with pretty good coffee and food . it does get crowded , and is expensive , which is why i ' m giving it N stars as it isn ' t always the most relaxing place to get brunch . but , in this area , it is the best place to go out for a good cup of coffee and a little breakfast . 
i luuuuuurve this spot ! living in stuytown , taverna kyclades is located just a short few blocks away . so happy that they expanded into the east village , because i wouldn ' t have wanted to travel all the way to astoria for fantastic greek food . i ' ve come here a few times , and each time the food was amazing and filled me up way faster than i expected . as mentioned , the grilled octopus is clutch - so tender and juicy and delicious , and even my cheap arse thinks it ' s worth the N price tag ! another app that i crave is the crab stuffed clams . it ' s very savory and fun to eat , and i always want more once i ' ve slurped up all the shell fillings N if you ' re in the mood for something rich and home-style , i really recommend the shrimp santorini . it ' s very comforting and umami rich , and you ' re left with plenty of delicious soupy goodness to dip leftover carbs into . i ' ve sampled almost all of their market priced fish from others ' plates , and they really let the individual flavors of the fish stand out through a seemingly universal preparation of grilling with sea salt , lemon juice , and olive oil . out of all the fish , the dorata had the most stand out flavor . the texture was smooth and buttery , and the flesh had a lot of umami to the taste . another stand out " fish " is their grilled baby shark ( sorry bb shark for eating you d ) . the meat is super buttery and tender and inoffensively non-fishy . and that thick garlicky dip that comes with can be paired with any fish that your friends will order . what else can i say ? i always end up stuffed and drowsily nearing food coma when i leave tarverna kyclades . they really are generous with the entree portions , especially keeping in mind you ' re getting a pretty huge side veggie dish as well . an advice i ' ll give is that you can always have your entree boxed up for later before you are on your last possible bite before stomach explosion , because when the dessert comes , you ' re going to want that custardy goodness . one time they ran out of galaktoboureko , and served a thick greek yogurt drenched in honey and nuts instead , which was also delicious ) also , talk loud and open up your ears . it ' s super " ambient " here , so less whisperings of sweet nothings to your hot dN and return to chowing down your food . 
tasty , coal-oven-style , napolitan pizza . thin crust that is nicely burned . tangy , sweet sauce . and while you eat , enjoy listening to the italian pop radio . 
you can find my boyfriend and i here on almost every holiday- i have nothing but good things to say about this place ! it was heartbreaking that they were out of alligator bites when we had gone the last time , but where one appetizer isn ' t , another is there to make up for it . have a meal with a pitcher of sangria , and you ' re good to go ! ! ! 
the pretzels are divine . the food is completely out of this world and made here on site . i love the ambiance and the people who work here are so helpful . it ' s on the very chicest block of the lower east side right across from pilgrim ( best vintage chanel in nyc ) so i call this my pilgrimmage -- i go look at chanel and then come here to eat and then go back after thinking if i can afford a chanel bag or not and on and on it goes . i know it ' s a bit crazy but the food is good and after a few drinks , sometimes i walk back over across the street to pilgrim and score some fashion or a great chanel bag ( if i ' m really drinking ! ha ! ) 
having great results at their east village location , ippudo has opened up a new location on the west side . though it is a tad smaller than their first restaurant in new york , the quality and service is quite exceptional . it was pack as soon it was noon and we were given a ten minute wait . the hostess made sure the watch for seats being cleared so we could have been seated as soon as possible which was great . as we were being seated , i contemplated to myself to make sure we got the same thing we had the first time we had ippudo in the east village so we can test their quality control . suprisingly , food came out very quickly even with the endless amount of people . the hirata pork buns were beyond delicious as the first time . their ramen , both the akamaru modern and the shiromaru hakata were just fine like it is , nothing new . i also had their ramen with the lunch set ( that cost a N surcharge ) which included a rice bowl with fried chicken pieces and a side salad the bowl had three little " popcorn chicken " sized pieces and they were also difficult to chew , having that tough texture . though they did not execute one small aspect , the overall experience was enjoyable . now if i ever need a place for food in the area , no need to look any further ! oh yeah , points for the cute waiter in the rolled up jeans ! 
service is ok . food and wine is average . the place is unique ( better excuse for no or poor designed space ) . i went there with my two female friends after happy hour near by . heard that they are famous for the artichoke dip . . . . hum . . . i guess why it tastes better than our other dish , pate with cherry mustard . the price is a bit too high for more of tapas style plates as well as the main dishes ( for which i didn ' t order ! ) but i did get a peek at the main dishes as the table next to us ( they ordered steak and fish ) , and they really not very appealing to me . p conclusion i probably won ' t go back unless a pretty girl insist ! 
stopped in for a late lunch ( or was it an early dinner ? ) with my girlfriend . she ordered the hoisin glazed mahi mahi and i got the yellowfin tuna . both dishes were phenomenal . the host and server we ' re both wonderful as well . we will definitely be regular visitors from now on . 
in response to elle w , i think uptight and discriminatory is unfair . first , you weren ' t there and are unsure exactly what went on , what they were wearing or how they were behaving . right off , them saying they went to the bar and were refused is ridiculous . they don ' t have a bar . there is a service bar but it is obviously a service bar , there are no seats . i think you should reconsider your review , an accusation of discrimination is very serious , especially when you are making without any firsthand knowledge . if your friends had an issue , they should have asked for the manager . 
after getting food poisoning a few times at memphis taproom i finally did the prudent thing and checked their health department report . memphis taproom failed their health inspection , they had N major health issue problems . no wonder i got so sick . any good lawyers out there who want to help me sue ? here is their terrible health inspection report . pa . state . gegov . com penns 
take me back to brookyln for some scratch bread . . . holy shit this was the food highlight of my trip . . i came here everyday while i was in ny to get some of their grits . . no lie , i was addicted ! ! this place is amazing amazing amazing , literally its a hole in the wall , but this place produces some of the most delicious foods i have ever put in my life . oh and did i mention this place is dirt cheap ? ? ? ? ? 
yelp is a scam . . . if you don ' t advertise with them they hide your positive reviews
great experience to visit scott i never forget this visit in my life , lovely place for visit . 
if your looking for authentic mexican cuisine in the greater new haven area then this is the place to be ! it ' s a quaint little place with patio seating and full of love ! the food . . . . there aren ' t words to describe how yummy it is ! ! ! the service excellent ! price excellent ! heaven . . . is understatement ! your missing something in life if you don ' t indulge yourself with this fine mexican food ! love love love this place ! 
it ' s been three weeks since i ' ve had breakfast here and i still can ' t get those ricotta pancakes out of my head . i ' m talking three fluffy , generously-stuffed with ricotta pancakes accompanied by a platter with warm fruit , butter , and syrup to add if you ' re feeling crazy . honestly , none of the accoutrements were even necessary . these were cakes of heaven . i also ordered a side of the pancetta , which was a true , thick-cut peppered pork belly . this was totally unnecessary , as my attention stayed with the pancakes the entire time . the restaurant is beautiful , the servers are courteous , and the coffee is fresh and delicious . it ' s the perfect place to have a bite before a stroll around gramercy park . 
experience " N of N stars reviewed february N , N new we had reservations for saturday feb Nst N i believe for N N pm . its an " ok " atmosphere , but with a lot of background noise . starting with our waitress who very nicely putting it was an absolute " snot " . i told her that i wanted one of the heartier items on the menu . . she " recommended the steak " , when it came it was literally not more than N ounces . . i was very disappointed to say the least when i told her that she recommended this entr e and it was by no means hearty she said she would gladly get me more but charge it for another full price entr e , i asked to speak to someone , a very nice gentleman came out i believe who said he was the chef and i told him of my plight he said it was a N oz portion ' but i felt it was not , he kindly offered to get me another one i said no , but one of my fellow diners had the " short ribs " , and even though that was also small it was a heck of lot bigger than my entr e . so they brought me out a mini portion of that . . we like fine dining but i also like to have some food with my dinner . . . the portions were terrible as well as the service . . we will not go back . by service we mean the rude waitress that we had not worth it by any means i believe our waitress ' s name was " alex " as previously mentioned in other reviews . you would think management would deal with someone like her with her poor service and " attitude " if they want to stay in business thank you visited february N
excellent noodles in a broth . soup was very tasty and fully of bountiful meaty flavor . super great to recover from a serious hangover or in need of a quick bite to quell the hunger pains . i ordered the spicy totto ramen topped with seasoned avocado . the addition of the toppings was worth the additonal charge . we also ordered some sake which was also very nice , smoth , crisp and refreshing . 
i loved this place i went for an early bday dinner with my girls the service was great from the bar to desert even in the rest room . . . the food was great which i cant say for much places nowadays and the frozen sangria ? ! yes ! ! im definatly coming back shout out to alexis
food is tasty , a bit rich . drinks are quite excellent . there is a bit of an air of snoot , but no place is perfect . the bartenders certainly keep busy , so i am not surprised they don ' t always wear a smile . it can get a bit tough to get a table later in the week , but credit goes to them for filling the place ! i like the little pieces of bread they provide before the food arrives especially . 
seriously ? ! ugh ! after reading all the good reviews , i decided to give this place a try . obviously , greenwich village hillbillies don ' t know what a true falafel tastes like ! N bucks for half a falafel sandwich ! that ' s more evil than paying N for a slice of pizza . the falafel itself was cracked and way tooooo crispy . i felt as if i was eating chips . instead of israeli salad , they put lettuce in their pita bread ! this place is tiny and there is no place for you to turn or move once inside . i am giving it one star because the pita bread was warm and sort of crispy too . if you love falafels , go there , you " ll hate it . 
this place is fabulous . i love the feels , i love the vibes . . i love all them damn beers they have on tap . ps did you freaking look at their chalk board ? says happy hour is from Nam to Npm , um can i just live there then please ? ? ? what would bring them to a N star is their food service mac n cheese with bacon N stars at best . it was lacking flavor , lacking creaminess . . honestly i had to eat a piece of bacon with each bite because without it was flavorless lamb slider N . N this was actually bomb . the lamb flavor was great , juicy , feta cheese made it . but when asking about the beef slider , we asked what the " house sauce " was and the server was like " i ' m not sure . we make it . but the sliders are good " jeez , what a generic answer . just tell me you don ' t know and you ' ll go ask . sorry , but that is a huge pet peeve of mine . this isn ' t applebees . sweetheart , you can do a bit better than that . and this place , with these selections of beer , deserve better . i would return , because beer is awesome . and i really love all the decor and the vibe of this place . just a few suggestions that the server could be a bit more engagingg ( she really never talked to us except to give us our food ! ) but i ' d be happy to try more options to see if my next experience is improved
great place to go at Nam after a long night of drinking . service is good almost everyone is nice . but there food is freezer burned . and cigarettes are nine bucks . ehhhh just ehhh . but if you ' re within walking distance and your blacked out this is the place for you . 
been here twice already . loved and enjoyed everything i had ! great service and very friendly staff . love coming here even though i live staten island . 
this place has a real beer smell to it . a little stale . i did like the food and the people and staff seemed really nice . 
finally a great restaurant in the heart of soho that isn ' t filled with tourists or pretentious overpriced ! galli has great ambience , food , drinks , and service . the staff goes above and beyond to make your experience excellent . the specialty cocktails are unique but not over the top . if you ' re a whiskey drinker , definitely go for the lanskey . the menu is fantastic - modern takes on classic comfort food . we had the spicy calamari ( yum ! ) and eggplant parm , both were great . i ' ll definitely be back for a full meal ( and the rice balls ! ) . 
i ate here with my N best friends right before we graduated last week . it was quiet on a tuesday around N pm and the staff was attentive and very congratulatory towards us . we ordered a round of blueberry mojitos and they were so good . we ordered the blue cheese garlic bread and quickly ordered more of it because it was unlike anything we had had before . there was outside seating , a raw oyster bar and one of the managers told me that there would be music and a fire pit later that night . . definitely an awesome summer spot with friends . 
excellent cakes . had vanilla buttercream with fresh strawberries at my baby shower and my son ' s baptism and everyone raved about them ! 
sooo delicious . the food here are fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced . it is one the my favorite italian restaurant in the neighborhood . whenever i ' m there i always ended up eating here . the best ever ! 
ok the corn . that ' s all i need to say here . the grilled corn is delicious . as soon as you enter this place you feel like you ' re in a small puerto rico . i ' ve been going every since i moved to nyc and i always bring my friends and family to show it off . . . love this place , always delicious , everytime ! 
i must ' ve driven past sketch a zillion time , each time intrigued by what wonders await beyond the hot pink and neon green facade . i decided to grab dinner there one night on my way to work , upon my boyfriend ' s roomate ' s ( bother ' s sister ' s cousin ' s parakeet ' s ) recommendation . mind you , if youve ever had a burger craving in philly , you know fishtown is the burger mecca . so if sketch was worth recommending , it must ' ve been bangin ' ! so i called in my order . . . as i was parking . . . obnoxious , i know . but i figured i ' d just sit and scope out all the cool sketches on the wall . doodle art galore ! i opted for a good ol ' fashion burger with bleu cheese , mushrooms and onions ( my go-to burger toppings ) and a side of green chili cheese fries . ( though i ' m told the kobe beef burger is what the clouds in heaven are made of ) . i remember thinking that N . N for a burger that doesnt come with sides from a place that looks like an N ' s carry out pizza joint was a bit steep . butttt then after only waiting a few minutes , my order was hot and ready . the cashier was very sweet and smiled the entire time . i thanked her and ran on my way . all in all , it was a messy burger . but thats often the sign of a good , juicy burger . toppings flying everywhere , juice running down my hands . . . . it was a massacre . the burger was outstanding , though still not my favorite in the area . i ' m curious to try their other burgers . truffle burger anyone ? ! om nom nom . the end . oh wait , you thought i forgot about the fries , didn ' t you ? ! don ' t be silly . a good fry is a measure of a good restaurant . while these are more like steak fries , which are not my personal style , they were deliciously seasoned ! the cheese sauce was tasty , didn ' t have that plasticy aftertaste some cheese sauces have . the green chilies were a nice touch but next time i think i ' ll just order cheese fries and smother them in sriracha . but be warned , that order of fries fed N hungry skinny girls at my job . . . you know , model types that could eat a whole herd of cows and still have room for desert ? so i highly recommend the fries as a stand alone munchy . happy sketching ! 
they have the best sicilian pizza and the service is great ! the food is good and it feels authentic . would definitely recommend going here ! 
the waitress was clearly new because she acted as though she had never checked anyone out before . 
wonderful food , great relax place , nice people . good for vegerarians as the choices are large . heathy too , next day i felt really good . have gluten free dishes or will make them on request . 
so far , so good . we ' ve been waiting for this place to open , since ( although the clifton area has lots of italian restaurants ) johnny carino ' s closed . it was so convenient to have a good spot near home , and for the quantity of italian restaurants around here , the good ones are pretty scarce . to be fair , we haven ' t done a sit down dinner yet and haven ' t tried out the wine selection . we were in a hurry and grabbed some take out . the service was great ( fast and super nice ) . the food was tasty , not authentic italian , but good . we tried the arugula salad , chicken meatballs and the eggplant pasta . everything was fresh , the portions were just the right size and everything was packaged in nice to go boxes . next time we try the wine ! ! 
stopped on the way back to ri from rutland . my wife ' s large buttermilk pancake was " crisp " on the outside and soft on the inside . my apple cider french toast was great . bacon and sausage patties were done just right . real maple syrup , knowledgeable and friendly staff . well worth the stop for breakfast . i am not a foodie or restaurant snob so i give it a N star especially for the location . give it a try because imo you will not be disappointed . 
so i decided to seek yelp ' s opinion on the best burger in the east village and this place was ranked highest . i went on a thursday evening around N . there were a few people there but it wasn ' t crowded . i went up to the bar to place my order N regular and N bacon slider with a bowl of fries . after about N minutes i approached the bar to get an estimate on the time as it was taking a little while . then i was told that i actually had a server who would bring the order to me . hmmm . how is it that i hadn ' t seen a server in N min . the food was ok but i wouldn ' t go out of my way to return . the burgers were , in fact , dripping with grease and tasted so-so . the taste came from the onions and cheese - less so the beef . the sauces were ok at best . the fries were served hot and seasoned well . glad i tried it but as there are so many spots around that serves burgers , i ' ll shop around more before returning . 
i agree , the service can be lacking , but the pizza must be sampled by any true connoseuir ( spelling ? screw it ) . i can ' t even walk by this place without getting an insatiable craving , it smells to good . i recommend the extra cheese -- it ' s an old favorite , but it can ' t be beat . 
cute restaurant on a street corner facing rittenhouse square . the restaurant is lined with tables for N which makes it perfect for people watching , soaking up the sun on a nice day , or enjoying a meal with the pups . the walls of the inside also open up so that those who don ' t get to do the sidewalk dining also get seating with a view . my friend , husband , and i decided to share three things amongst ourselves for brunch . here we go french onion soup simply delicious with thick stretchy cheese . must try . buttermilk pancakes sounds plain , i know . but it isn ' t ! vanilla is added to the batter which makes for very tasty and sweet , but not too sweet , pancakes . it ' s a subtle way of spicing up good ol ' pancakes . steak and eggs steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well . it came with a side of potatoes and N sunny side up eggs . yum ! perfect beginning to our first day in philly . 
should i do N or N . . . ? that is my dilemma . i ' m thinking N is appropriate . rating a restaurant or anything else is a highly personal decision , and with that in mind i will give this brief review . for starters i we had oysters . they were good . ( well i almost gagged on one of them , but that ' s just the nature of the beast mollusk . ) to accompany that was a glass of muscadet . following was our mains striped bass ( excellent ) and " brick " chicken ( very , very good . very salty , but de-lish still . ) my lack of what would be a fourth star comes mainly from the sides that accompanied the entrees . i had mashed sweet potatoes . they were a little baby-food-esk . something didn ' t taste right . but not a huge deal . the other " stuff " on my plate was a chopped radish and cilantro salad ( ? ) and bits of grapefruit . . . . . ( very creative , but not that fun to eat . ) my dinner date ' s side was turnips . . . . ( again , kudos for creativity , but not making my tongue happy . ) dessert was good . apple something or other . i had a glass of armagnac to finish off . i am picky . i acknowledge that . but i have to follow my gut . sometimes meals make me happy , sometimes sad . some inspire me and others , well , leave me wanting . . marlow , i want to love you . maybe i will be back again and explore all that you have to offer . but , until then , N stars for you buddy ( N . N if i could ) meal price N with tip for N
been going here for about a year . overall , better dumplings than dumpling house a few blocks up the street , and less crowded . thinner skin , more filling , better flavor . the only problem i had was , once or twice , there was some serious gristle or something in the pork chive . i know - gross - but being honest here . barring that , this has become my default cheap dumpling place . 
delicious pizza , well priced ! we got a half half -- hot cherry pepper and sliced tomato and basil . both were awesome . will go back here ! 
this place has been at the top of my " to-brunch " list for quite some time , and i am so happy to have finally tried it . the menu is very unique to other places in the area , and the wait time is shorter too . for a party of N at prime brunch-time , we waited about N minutes , most of which was spent inside the flower shop next door . the place is very small , but decorated well . i liked the honest openness of the host . he seemed physically pained every time a new party arrived and he had to tell them that there were no tables available and they had to wait . after reading many reviews , i decided on a latte ( delicious ! ) and i split both the foul moudamas and the chorizo benny . my boyfriend ' s mom got the quiche , which had great presentation . my main complaint is that a few of the flavors were weird . the veggies that come with the quiche are reminiscent of those frozen veggie variety packs at the grocery store , which isn ' t that appetizing . the chorizo was also not what i was expecting , but still good . the portions are very hearty , which is great . for the simple ingredients ( hummus , beans , bread , eggs . . . ) , the prices are a bit steep . there are tons of good brunches around that cost a bit less , so this place probably won ' t become a regular spot . the mini hot sauce on the table was cute , but ended up just being sriracha , and you have to ask for ketchup , which is then given to you in little disposable packets . i suppose that makes it more european , but it also creates more waste . . . we left with a few macarons to-go , which was a great treat for later in the afternoon . they were way too beautiful to pass up ! they didn ' t taste super fresh , but i will chalk that up to them sitting in the car for a few hours . overall , it ' s definitely a spot to try if you love brunch . 
ok general american food , never impressed . i like it for the ambiance , live music , beer , and easy going staff . 
charming . intimate . delicious . gottino is one of my wife and i ' s favorite places to grab brunch or just pop in for some small bites and a glass of wine - errr , ummm , glasses of wine . this quaint little establishment serves up some of the best crostini ' s i ' ve ever had the pleasure of shoveling into my gourd . my favorite being the creamy goat cheese , honey , walnut , and figs served on toasted italian bread . down N-N of them with a glass of prosecco for a taste-bud-exploding pairing . gottino also does a great breakfast . their mimosa ' s are made with fresh orange juice , always a big win . they steam their eggs , which gives them a moist and creamy texture that is a complete olfactory experience . on nice days , be sure to try and grab a seat out back in the mini-garden . it ' s secluded from the street noise and provides a lovely setting for some intimate conversation . 
ambience is most important when i eat out , and i loved this one . very typical west village restaurant - dark , simple furniture , very lively . food was really good , too . 
excellent service , great ambience , awesome carribean style restaurant . my wife and i had lunch here and we must say , we were impressed with everything . from the smart menu in an otterbox type frame , simple with not so many items , but just enough to leave your mouth watering and curious of every item . anyway , lets get to the most important part , the food . i had jerked chicken wings with okra fries . i must say , ive eaten at plenty carib . spots but this jerked chicken takes the cake . i love spicy food and this was right down my alley and i love that they have a non spicy bbq option as well if thats not your thing ( my wife ) . it wasnt hot sauce type spicy , it was a natural spicy that was spicy because of the natural herbs and spices ! i prefer okra fries over all fries now as well , thats how good they were ( this was my first time eating okra fries ) . theyre fried in a special plantain flour that make your mouth water as you eat them . my wife had the salmon burger with chips . you cant go wrong with the salmon burger , seasoned and cooked to perfection served with chips ( also can be served with okra fries ( recommended ) . even the chips were made with a seasoning they make there that was absolutely delicious . and all this was washed down with a wonderfully made sorrel which is one of my favorite carribbean drinks ( served non-alcoholic , but restaurant is b . y . o . b so bring rum if you want it loaded ! ) . oh and the water is served with a lemon and a cucumber slice which makes it so refreshing it might be illegal . this place is truly special because of the way they cook healthy food , it leaves wanting more plus you leave feeling better than when you came in . this is a truly special place which i will come to frequently because i feel it truly is vital , all pun intended ! 
my wife , son and i decided to try the stone hearth since we drive by all the time on way to yale . it was a wonderful experience . the waitress , laura , was an absolute delight . she was very informative , upbeat , and explained each entree in detail . from the homemade bread with dipping oil , to our entrees and the fabulous dessert , it was an ideal night out . the atmosphere was not loud and boisterous as most restaurants downtown tend to be . we got to spend a lovely evening with our son . we are planning on going again one day soon ! prices tend to be a bit on high side , but worth the price . ) carmen
trendy , but not pretentious . good beers and a variety of mixed drinks with unique ingredients . the place has a chill vibe , which is rare in the financial district . the drinks and food are overpriced , but really creative and enjoyable . i went with a group of N on a saturday night and it was very tight in there . great for N people so you can squeeze into the bar area or find a nook . 
mmmmmmm , the cheesesteak was so good ! just like everyone else said . my carnivore boyfriend loved it . i also really liked the salad dressing and the mango pineapple smoothie . 
my favorite restaurant in astoria . freshest seafood in nyc . . . which is why there is a line outside the restaurant every night of the week ! i recommend the octopus to start , and the grilled shrimp . my husband loved the baby shark . my mouth is watering right now just thinking of the shrimp ! ! also , they gave me a super sweet and unexpected surprise on my birthday . i love you taverna kyclades ! ! ! 
i love this bar , the service is always good , the girls that work there are nice , and i haven ' t had a single thing there i haven ' t liked . their sandwiches that i have had so far have been great , the salmon blt , pear and brie sandwich , and veggie burger are all good , and veggie burgers are hard to get right . their kitchen is open late so it ' s a good spot to go late when you ' re hungry . their food is much better than typical bar food . i bring people there all the time ! 
another absolutely amazing experience here . this is the first time that i ' ve experienced the bar experience here at yasuda and i loved it . the bf ate almost everything on the recommended a la carte menu and the chef took us on an amazing sushi experience . i think one of my favorite aspects about the omakese here is that the chefs will give you N types of the same type of fish to try together so you can taste the difference between them . for example , for most sushi restaurants when you order omakese , the meal will usually end with one type of eel . here the chefs give you a fresh water eel and a sea eel . we had N types of yellow tail , fatty tuna , many different types of salmon and trout , and the list goes on and on . eating at the bar for omakese beats table omakese anytime ! 
new favorite local spot
excellent casual neighborhood joint . their squash taco is to die for . very affordable . 
before today i would have been one of the many raving about how great this place is . however , i just got home from this restaurant and i ' m appalled at the horrible , unprofessional and disrespectful service my fiance and i received . we ordered two arroz con pollos which we have always ordered when we go there and besides the pollo a la plancha is the plate we recommend to everyone we tell to go there . when we received our plates after taking the first bite we immediately noticed the sour and awkward old taste . it had a strong smell to it that wasn ' t normal along with a cold piece of chicken which confirmed our suspicions , the food was old ! we are not picky eaters and never complain even at the bad service offered by some of the waitstaff there whenever we go . but this time we had to speak up as we love the food in this place and were surprised this food was given to us . wanting to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt my fiance discreetly walked to the back and let our waitress know that the food had a foul taste . she became upset and rude and let him know that she could do nothing for us and we still had to pay and there would be no refunds or exchanges . we never said we wouldn ' t pay we just refuse to pay for a foul plate of food that will make us sick and have to pay for the replacement food as well ! ! ! this is unheard of ! ! ! i then went back there and told her the food did not taste right and was old . she told me she already told my fiance she could do nothing for us . later she came to my table and told me she spoke to the kitchen and they told her the food was made in the morning and the rice was the only thing changed . clearly shows the guilt of knowing that the food was old and they knew what they served us was old . my fiance and i then went to the register to pay for the sangria which we only drank half of the pitcher where she told us " call the cops i am not dealing with this shit " i have never in my life had such horrible customer service . more so than the bad food , the reaction from this waitress was rude and unacceptable ! you work in the service industry and were in the wrong . the food was foul , it was not fresh and she was trying to force us to pay for food that would make us sick only because she was concerned with it coming out of her pocket ! ! i do not seek anything but merely want to let you know that the waitstaff is rude , inattentive , and offer horrible service that in the end will bring this place down , specifically this blonde rude waitress with the straight shoulder length hair . i wish i knew her name so i could be more specific . sadly i will never be able to go back to one of my favorite food places . needless to say that i will tell all my friends , coworkers and family the rotten food and horrible service received . 
get the chicken pot pie . or the steak and ale pie . both were super good . service here was really good , even though it was super crowded and really noisy . 
absolutly loved it ! i had an amazing dinner there with my boyfriend last night . . . we love loved the fallafel buns , the green avocado salad and i have to say that the chopped ocopus salad was the best i ever had the staek was nice and tender . . defenatly we will be back
crowded around dinner time so prepare and arrive early . food is always delicious . 
when you ask the chef how the hamachi and maguro are that day and he rolls his eyes as if i spoke japanese , you know something is wrong . i pointed to the hamachi and he said " oh , yellowtail . " the hamachi looked a bit dry and the maguro didn ' t look very fresh . this is an " american " restaurant that serves sushi with their other dishes to attract yuppie customers . i ' m not a big fan of fusion and even less of a fan of american-sushi . leery of the sushi , i ordered the hawaiian ribeye . it was too sweet sauce overpowers the taste of the beef . on the other hand , the banana creme pie was terrific especially its crust . i watched the sushi chefs while i ate and their handling and prep practices were enough to convince me not to order any nigiri or sashimi . you won ' t see traditional japanese people eating sushi there . it ' s a great looking place though if that ' s important to you . the desert , clean nice looking interior and friendly service kept it from getting a N star . 
i had always heard about eight turn crepe . i am in love with this place . their crepes are to die for . the fruits are fresh , everything just worked well together . 
this is where i go when i want to indulge in salty goodness . the fries are excellent and the dipping sauces are equally as good . inexpensive too ! 
i love when technology and dining out meet - even if it ' s not perfect . i went to honeygrow , a relatively new spot in center city for a quick bite last saturday . when i stepped into honeygrow i was impressed with the signage and the ordering system . it was sort of like wawa " s ordering system but with healthier choices . i looked over the menu and choose from the stir fry section , the beef and black bean selection . i walked over to the register and waited for my food . . . . . and waited . . . and waited more . finally the manager asked me if i ' ve been helped . i told him i punched it in on the screen a while ago , he goes over to the screen and searches for my order , finds it , apologized and asked me if i swiped my credit card . i started to say no , but my there ' s no such thing as a free lunch gene kicked in and i replied " no " and paid with cash . he gave me a soft drink cup and said my order will be right up and to have a seat . i got a drink and took a window seat to participate in my favorite sport - people watching while waiting for my food . . . and waited . . . and waited . again he finally came over to me and asked me if i got my food , again i said " no " . he went back and brought me my food , apologized and offered me a free smoothie for my trouble . i said thanks but i will get it when i ' m leaving . the dish i ordered was beef with black beans and stir fried noodles with sugar beans and ginger . in the photo it had thin strips of beef , but mine had cubes of beef and it was very tough . the noodles however were outstanding and so were the veggies , and that saved them . honeygrow had all the accompanying sauces too . after eating , i go up to the counter to get my free smoothie and chose a strawberry , dark chocolate and fresh mint concoction . the girl behind the counter forgot about it being complimentary , so i had to wait . . . and wait until she got the managers okay . the smoothie had a nice taste to it but she didn ' t put any ice in it and started tasting like cough syrup after a while . this could be a real go to spot if the iron out the wrinkles . 
good mexican food and margaritas . fish tacos are great . 
a new amazing , healthy , reasonably priced restaurant . the atmosphere is calming , it ' s beautiful and tastefully decorated . the staff are sweet as pie . on to the food . . . seasoned with love , just enough and the caribbean influence on the food items make these healthy dishes quite tasty ! the stuffed avocado paired with a paradise smoothie is an amazing combo . the hummus is to die for . all around the food is absolutely amazing ! a perfect place for vegans and non vegans alike . 
i always come here and usually end up getting the bbq chicken melt , which is great . the new onion ring appetizer is good as well . the service , on the other hand is slow . every time i go , it ' s the same slow service . 
N dumplings for N . thin skins and delicious filling infinitely better than those doughy globs you get at vanessa ' s . for another N bucks , you can get a very tasty bowl of hot and sour soup and a veggie sandwich made from their wok bread ( dont know the actual name ) . downside is that there is really nowhere to sit , but still totally worth it . 
the staff was really congenial , since they kept checking in with me , during my N . N hour wait for a table on a hot saturday morning . so that is a rare anomaly amongst my new york restaurant experiences . i ' m not really a fan of the food , since the brunch portions were rather small . the cheese grits were great though . if anything , i would come back for that , since good grits are so rare in new york . 
the spotted pig is a great little spot . been there a few times , but most recently was there last thursday and it was packed ( not surprisingly ) . couple of friends and i went there for drinks first and just decided to stay and eat something instead of going somewhere else ( which was the original plan ) . we wound up sitting against a post next to the bar upstairs on some bar stools . . . like i said , the place was packed and we just wanted an easy bite so it worked for us . . . for an app , i get it every time and i ' ll always get it , the gnudi . . . i have day dreams about this dish . . . the bleu cheese burger after was fantastic as anticipated , juicy and just damn good . . . great spot . . . service is decent , kinda hectic but that ' s the atmosphere . . . of course i ' ll be back . 
i have yet to find a better place for group dinners in manhattan than alta . huge menu of delicious tapas makes for a great communal experience , sharing each dish with everyone at the table . and the super yummy and really strong sangria only enhances the " communal experience . " we sat in the " attic " which was weird at first because we walked upstairs and literally through the kitchen into this tiny loft-like space with just a few other tables . cozy and intimate and loud , i imagine , if you ' re sitting amongst loud people ( like my friends ) . also , we had this really bizarre waitress who made intense eye contact with everyone at the table without ever breaking a smile . it was actually more humorous than annoying as the night went on because she was just so miserable . anyway , standout small plates coca ( catalonian flatbread ) pulled pork empanadas asparagus tempura fried goat cheese but really , everything we ordered was delicious and unique . another great thing if you have a nut allergy , let them know and they ' ll provide you with a special " nut-ok " menu . note about " the whole shebang " ( everything on the menu for N ) -- my boyfriend entered the entire menu into excel and took the sum of all the dishes . . . yeah , i know . but the point is that all the dishes combined is only N . so , not that great of a deal , and you ' re probably better off just ordering a lot of the dishes that you really like . other random notes sangria doesn ' t come in pitchers ( which is probably a blessing in disguise because they are strong ) and they accept amex or cash payment only
had the red hook special ( chicken cutlet , turkey breast , bacon , american cheese , ltmsp ) and the pork , eggplant , broccoli rabe and provolone sandwich . . . both sandwiches amazing ! ! this place was great , the sandwiches are huge N N vs . N N i cant tell the difference and the N N is a dollar more so you can have it for dinner . it ' s really busy during lunch and you won ' t find too many nolita soho types here . i still can ' t get over how good these sandwiches are , it ' s not just a huge sandwich it ' s all really good , albeit an overindulgence for the week . just go and eat here ! ! ! as many have stated cash only ! ! 
walked right in and was seated immediately on a sunday afternoon with guests from out of town . the place has the atmosphere of uno ' s to me , kitschy red checkered table cloths and an over-riding sense that the place is resting on its past glory and fame . the lay-out of the restaurant is quite odd and the atmosphere is lacking . however , the pizza is reasonably priced for the location and you get what you pay for . the crust has a slight char to it from the coal oven and is pretty tasty . maybe not the ultimate , but certainly very good . take a few pictures , revel in the joy of being at a famous pizza place , and check it off the bucket list . food is N star service and atmosphere are N star . 
so i ' m a little or extremely late to the game . i finally came here for lunch . there are a ton of little stalls to try different types of italian food . and for the first time i think in a long time , i can sincerely say i have tried two types of things i have never had before . ingredient a blood clam or " truffle of the sea " . . . blood clam is a much better description . it tastes like a super salty , briny , oyster , but with the consistency of a clam . very interesting . never had this before ingredient b sea bean . not string bean , but sea bean . its this twig like ingredient that is almost candy apply green in color . but because it grows and lives in the sea there is this salty flavor . it adds a great natural flavor . delicious . 
came here for breakfast with my out of town guest . it was ok , waffles and coffee at par . the decor is great . our server was attentive . 
i love the shrimp dumplings ! soup dumplings are a little messier than i ' d like but they taste great . make sure you have them read your order back to you , i ' ve received the wrong items on more than one occasion . 
a warm spot with great pizza , to be sure . we got the sausage pizza and were really happy with it , it was saucy and cheesy and you can see them break apart the sausage by hand and throw it on the pie . the oven roasted salad was solid , though unspectacular . definitely try the rotolo ! it was full of crispy goodness and prosciuto cotto ( which was closer to ham than prosciutto ) and pistachios . really , really good , and for N . N a pretty good size - worth thinking about stopping by and picking one up for lunch . the only blemish was that we only ordered three things and our waiter forgot N of them , so there was that . . . 
best ramen from west to east . i like the flavor better than shin shen gumi of ippudo . come early to avoid a line . spicy ramen is the best way to go . order pork bun and hot tea and you got yourself a good dinner for less than N bucks . however , def not a place for date night . 
meatballs ! and served to you however you may want them . pretty awesome plus not too expensive at all . the meal might look small but i was pretty full after the meal . also got a side of mashed potatoes which tasted buttery and awesome along with a beer which was only N dollars for a glass i believe . i want to come back to try other combinations but was really satisfied with the meatballs . if anything just offer more diversity . that would require altering the menu but honestly the place is pretty good as it is . they have ice cream sandwiches too that i didn ' t try but it reminded me of the cool haus truck . 
yum yum yum . ok so after the fact that one has to wait at least an hour at any day of the week for this restaurant . it is well worth it . has a great wine and beer selection . our party of four ordered a wide range of stuff - myself just the burrata and tomato salad ( fresh but a small portion ) , my husband the giant prawns ( omg these were the biggest prawns ever and so soft and buttery ) and our companions a steak and the lamp chop which they raved about . the best side by far was the pan fried mashed potatoes ( and no they ' re not too salty theyre potatoes they should be ! ) and the spinach was a close second . honestly not N stars just because of the wait - but i ' ll have to return at some strange hour to get those potatoes ! ! ! 
i have been going to l b since i was a kid , and now my kids love it as much as i do . pizza doesn ' t get any better than l b ! ! ! 
so good , worth the usual wait
do not think that you will have a nice happy hour . they have to be crazy charging N . N for a bottle of budweiser at N N in the afternoon on a monday ! ! ! 
great , fresh food and interesting characters who serve you . only thing keeping me from going N stars is the cleanliness of the eating area . olaf , wash the walls down once in a while ! 
the rayu sauce is delicious ! ! ! ! fantastic taste , excellent service , friendly staff and cool feeling place . the ambiance is very cool because they cook everything in front of you . the food comes out fast , especially in the dinner service . overall , totto was worth the wait , especially with bar seating . and now i ' m craving some ramen . 
second time here , i was so excited to go again . i knew there was going to be a long wait which i had no problem . the restaurant does not take reservations , to find out only for friends . a slap in the face when the party arrives and says in front of . a crowd of waiting people at this point we were waiting N hours . , we have a reservation , they were seated immediately . i called twice during the week and explained it was my moms Nth birthday . she said no reservations . friends make sure there not dum enough to announce they have reservations . when your establishment does not take them . the owner tired to embarrass us by announcing our minutes after you we ' re confronted . your guilty conscious ripped right out of you . also tell your front desk girls to smile , they are the most miserable people i have every seen . the food is not worth it . make sure you touch up on your business ethics . what a shame . 
went here last night and it was perfect . i had the skirt steak and my girl friend had breaded chicken . we also had the avocado fries which were really good . if you eat meat , get the steak well worth it and not a bad price ( N ) . the only negative thing was how much ice was in pitcher of sangria , single glass is probably better value . not worth taking a star off though . we ' ll be back here for sure . 
food is okay . not bad , but not so good either . service and everything else was great . make sure you sit toward the center of the restaurant , otherwise you are staring at the big white curtain all night long . it ' s a nice restaurant with mediocre food . i suggest to go there for drinks and desserts . not food . 
yum ! ! very good ramen ! i give it N . N stars . i don ' t think the ramen noodles is homemade , because samurai mama is a udon place , not a ramen place . that being said , their ramen is still fricken awesome ! ! love the broth , vegetables , and pork . the ramen comes with side salad , egg and side vegetable . i also notice inside their broth it had sauteed scallions and thin slices of eggplant-- this is a bit original , but i really like this because i enjoy having more than just the typical char siu pork in there . overall , delicious ! ! place was cute and cozy . note cash only ! ! 
went there for a birthday party and the staff was extremely helpful and nice . the special was black squid ink pasta with all the seafoods including lobster . huge portions easily fed N ( with leftover dinner the next night for N ) . the calamari was tender and delicious . and the chicken and eggplant was great . the sauce is as good as any italian restaurant . it ' s crowded , loud , and fun . wine list was reasonable . 
amazing ! ! ! ! love every thing in this place . great service ! keep it coming blue ribbon ! fried chicken are the boom ! ! ! 
we had a fantastic meal here last night . the staff was friendly and knowledgable , the chef visited each table twice . the food was remarkable from start to finish . i will definitely go back , hopefully more than once . my favorite items were the duck breast and the mocha bread pudding . 
all i have to say is service , service service ! ! ! amazing ! ! our server marcelo made our night ! he was super hot , friendly , funny and made the entire night wonderful for my friends and i . i am returning and recommending this place to all and coming back . the food is some of the best venezuelan food i have eaten in nyc , ( yes , i ' m comparing it to queens venezuelan and even red hook truck specials , this place has them all beat ! ) 
good quiet spot for some home cooked polish food . truly authentic

brunch time can get busy . food portions are perfect . staff is attentive . at first glance my steak and eggs looks tiny , but as i finished i thought , " i ' m so glad i didn ' t order more food " . 
i finally got a chance to eat at pizzeria verita . it was a good experience , one we expect to repeat . this is not your typical pizza joint . the wood-fired pizza is a classic neapolitan pie . the toppings are simple , fresh , and flavorful . the crust is chewy and tasty . our meal started with two salads , a caesar and the mista with goat cheese . both were very good but the mista with warm goat cheese was the winner of the two . the goat cheese is encrusted with toasted , seasoned bread crumbs and tossed with a light vinaigrette . both salads were large , but the mista was a bit larger and could have served two . as for the pies , we had the regina margherita and salsiccia e rapini with fennel sausage . they have seasonal and daily special pies but we wanted to test their standard fare . it took about N-N minutes from order to table , which was impressive because they were pretty full . the pies were done to perfection . because these are wood fired pies , the crusts , especially at the fringes , can get a bit singed but i don ' t mind that . the pies are N-N inches and cut into quarters . i note that because one pie really only serves one adult . dinner for two with salads , pizzas and a cocktails came to N . more expensive than a normal pizza joint but ultimately worth what we paid . i would suggest reservations on the weekends . we got lucky and walked into table at Npm on a friday . five minutes after we were seated it was sro . tables seem to turn over rapidly but if you ' re in a hurry , call ahead . 
another family favorite ! filet mignon on a stone , best place for shrimp garlic sauce ( to dip ur bread ) , sangria will knock u on ur a . 
best pizza in town . 
this is one of the best family owned italian restaurants i have ever been to . the food is outstanding and the specials were so imaginative . not only is the service excellent but the head chef came to our table to check on us which is always nice in such an intimate setting . with such great food and staff its no wonder why this place is packed with customers all the time . the poor reviews on this restaurant just go to show you that there are some people in this world that are impossible to please . if you are ever in the caldwell area this place is a must to stop at for fine italian cooking . 
even on a weekday morning , you ' re most likely going to have a wait here . from what i ' ve seen , it looks like it might be your best bet to have breakfast for dinner and come in the evening ( if you ' re not up for taking out , which is another option ) . i had the blueberry pancakes , and they were absolutely amazing . they ' re so fluffy and filling . divine ! the maple butter is the perfect addition . my dad was also thrilled with the country breakfast . i can ' t wait to go back , though it ' s probably going to be a while . . . gotta wait for some out of town guests to come visit me ! 
amazing food ! best chinese food ever . best food ever ! don ' t not go there , but go there ! 
palma is perfect . the covered back garden looks like something out of a fairytale , with fresh roses everywhere on the vine covered brick walls , its like stepping back in time , if they had really , really good food back then . i would recommend this restaurant to really anyone but at night with the christmas lights and flowers , it would make an excellent romantic date restaurant . during the day , come here for brunch and prepare to instantly be put in a good mood by the bright sunlight and happy , shabby chic atmosphere . the food is excellent . for brunch , we got eggs benedict , the burrata and a salad and everything was perfectly cooked and served . we had the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake for dessert . just get it . the the service was just as good . our waiter was attentive without being overbearing . i will definitely , definitely be back to try dinner . 
the place has a good ambiance . certainly very romantic , incase you are looking for a place to take your date out this holiday season . the food was good , especially the pho . if you have somewhat of a sweet tooth like i do , i highly recommend the spiced apple cake . i walked in around N and the place was packed , so definitely make a reservation for dinner if you don ' t want to wait N minutes like i did . the server was friendly . he recommended the drink fig-a-tini for me , which was good . all those didn ' t cause me an arm and a leg like many other places in manhattan would . that is always a plus . bottom line , i will definitely come back . 
the food was great , and the room was comfortable . we were the last group to leave and the owners were more than happy to wait for us to finish . the only downside is that the food was small portioned , especially for he price . 
we were in philly for the weekend and we decided to do a cheese steak taste test competition . we stopped by the normal ishkabibbles to try a steak , but the line was out the door and there was no seating , so we decided to go to the second location . it was very large , but the place was pretty empty . it looked like an old mcdonalds and our food was not very good , in fact , we rated it last on our list of steaks . i really wouldn ' t go here , but i still think the original may be worth a try . 
on a saturday morning , after a late friday night , silk city is a good place to go for hangover brunch . if you like pretty things , you ' ll like silk city . the bier garden is really sexy in the summer and the diner section is retro nostalgic of a time when people actually thought the future would be cool and we ' d be flying around in spacecrafts . the drinks are pretty good and the food is decent . my favorite thing for brunch in the whole world is huevos rancheros , and , if you feel the same way , this is probably not the place for you . sure , it ' s kind of tasty but it is basically nachos with a flare of huevos . so , because of this huevos fail , i give silk city N , not N stars . also , i hate silk city on friday and saturday nights . of course , that ' s only because i ' m not " bro " enough for it . 
after a couple not so great experiences , i finally realized that london is one of those really great neighborhood places-if you know what to order . went here with my hubby and another couple-the nachos for the app were great , and they brought us a little plate of mushrooms to sample . i had the mussels in red for my entree which were great-the mussels were big , the bowl filled generously , and the red sauce was great ! everyone else in my group was happy too with the food . the sangria wasn ' t so great . one of the big benefits , in my opinion , is that unlike a lot of restaurants , they ' ll let you order off the bar menu in the dining room , which has good prices . 
honest tomes is amazing
i love stowe ' s . . . they can do no wrong ! if youre in the mood for quick , delicious drive in fried seafood , pass everyone else by and stop at stowe ' s . it ' s such an adorable , kitschy little joint with a few seats inside ( so you can look at their long-collected pirate junk and watch the lobsters crawl around ) or you can sit outside picnic-table style and watch the cars go by and the beach beyond . stowe ' s is always my choice for fish n chips , friend shrimp , softshell crab sandwhiches , clam strips , etc when im home . they should also be commended for their fresh ( raw ) seafood , too which is available market-style to customers wishing to cook it themselves . i know my mom wouldn ' t go anywhere else ! if you dig cute little dives and real fried seafood , don ' t pass stowe ' s by ! 
yum ! went here the other day with some friends and had a really delightful dinner . the drinks were super tasty , the outdoor garden was very inviting , and the waiters were very nice . also the prices were reasonable considering how nice the place is . will def come back ! 
my only complain with this place is that it closes so early ! you can get some of the best deals just before closing though . if you want to eat , come two hours before it shuts down or most of the vendors will have already started packing up their delicious foods . you ' re going to want to make a point to stop at dinic ' s , bassette ' s , and the creperie . also stop in for amish weekend or head over to aj ' s picklepatch for fresh preserves ! 
stopped in here one day to grab some food as i did not feel like cooking that day . got the storachi wings and enjoyed them quite a bit . ended up going back there another day and tried the yum-yum wings which i would recommend to people to try . much better than the storachi . this place would get N stars , but the consistency of the wings can be a bit off in the way they cook them . one chef seems to put a ton of sauce on them while the other is stingy . 
as opposed to the majority of people who probably go to shogun for the hibachi , i actually go there for the sushi . although i have eaten at the restaurant several times , every week at some point i end up ordering take-out sushi . it is reliably delicious and the same every week . the triple delight sushi ( about N pieces of white fish , tuna and salmon ) comes with salad and miso soup . i usually order two for my husband and myself- more than enough food- and the bill comes to a little over N . a little pricey , but worth it . 
the best place for all ur guilty pleasures ! ! 
excellent , authentic mexican food , i love the salsa . it does get crowded on the weekends and be ware , it ' s cash only . 
been here many times . i love the beer . the selection is always very interesting . i love the buffalo wings and weve been in for brunch many times . the benedicts are hit or miss , but the biscuits n gravy are killer ! the bald guy in the kitchen does always look pissee though . maybe someone needs to tell him that the kitchen is open and he can be seen . 
i had reviewed before , but lost my account , and wanted to reiterate that i love mad greek ! the service is great ( james and one of the main employees tim ) are lovely people . the food is really good , i love the pizza , pasta and sandwiches . and the beer selection is very large , with seasonal options that the staff is more than happy to give opinions suggestions about . mad greeks is a nice neighborhood staple that i ' ve been going to for many years and will keep going to as long as i ' m in philly . 
came here on a tues . night and can ' t believe the place is packed . we were looking for a restaurant close by where we got our facials ( om spa ) . wallse was fully booked and so was perry st . however perry st . allow walk-ins for the bar area . we got the last seating at the bar where we ate our memorable and delicious dinner despite an over-sized bouquet in front of us . our waitress was friendly and attentive . beautiful atmosphere however the bar seating is not comfortable due to its short backs . the attendees here are well dressed - the kind of people you will see at fancy resorts - i see a ladies night out crowd , business people as well as well-heeled couples . despite coming to the restaurant during restaurant week , we skipped it and went for something more enticing . i started with the peeky toe crab dumplings and then the entree -pomegranate bbq braised short ribs which was melt in your mouth meat along with heirloom thinly sliced tomatoes that i can ' t stop talking about to my husband . it was incredibly delicious and a highly recommended dish . i nick a star off since dessert wasn ' t impressive given the standards of this place . i had the strawberry tiramisu . i thought the dessert cup was pretty since it was swirled with strawberries . i just thought the strawberry topping was too sweet . it would have been better off topped with fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream . also , i would have like the marsala wine or some kind of liquor infused into the saviordi fingers ( the cookie portion ) and into the zabligone . maybe there ' s better performing desserts but i guess i would have to come back to find out which isn ' t a bad thing since this place overall delivers beautiful and delicious cuisine . 
solid food
i love this place ! it ' s on the smaller side , so i wouldn ' t go with more than N people or else you ' ll be cramped . but the bruschetta is great . all the pasta and chicken dishes are great . we always get the frozen orange , which is perfect after all the olive oil . there ' s something that ' s " small new york " about it . and the owner ' s a doll . 
in the past i would have put a N star review , but after not going there for over a year , last night i was really disappointed after going from nj just to have their lamb over rice . it was flavorless compared to the delicious taste it used to have before . am i the only one who thinks it doesn ' t taste the same anymore ? 
a favorite
tribeca is where all the cool new york-based celebrities live and what ' s more , where all the celebrity wannabes hang out preoccupied with their smartphones to look like cool celebrities . your tolerance of this type of self-absorbed new yorker will determine your enjoyment of this fashion-forward italian taverna prominently located on the corner of greenwich and north moore . they come here like mosquitoes to a bug zapper . the food is quite good and the staff quite attentive and gracious , but the clientele can have that unbearable odor of entitlement even during the mid-morning hour when their breakfast menu is served . when you have names like robert de niro and chef andrew carmellini involved , i guess it can ' t be helped . carmellini ' s " urban italian " cookbook is quite amazing , and on my last visit eastward , i tried his latest creation in the village , the dutch , and liked it a lot . so i made a reservation on open table , and they were going to crowd us in a booth where we could literally rub elbows with the faux-glitterati . however , we spotted an open cafe table in the expansive bar area that was far more to our liking ( photo bit . ly Njhdfz ) . the breakfast menu is small but appetizing with italianate dishes the most alluring ( photo bit . ly Njhkrl ) . jamie w . decided to have the N zucchini frittata , a modestly fluffy creation speckled with roasted tomatoes , goat cheese and fiore di zucca ( squash blossoms ) ( photo bit . ly Nbiwjd ) . it was light and tasty . i went a little more decadent with first a large N slice of the carrot bread which i shared with jamie ( photo bit . ly NasNxev ) . quite moist with just enough sweetness to kick-start our late-starting morning . my entree was the N uova modenese , which turns out to be carmellini ' s creative twist on corned beef hash and eggs benedict . the hash is made of housemade cotechino sausage , spinach , and a tomato-based hollandaise ( photo bit . ly Nso ) . accompanied by a couple of slices of grilled rustic bread , it was a nearly perfect romanesque breakfast . the N crispy garlic potatoes were more like classy home fries ( photo bit . ly NjhvNp ) . no complaints there as the potato chunks were crisped on the outside with the potato meshing nicely with a heavy dose of garlic . it should come as no surprise that the housemade coffee was richly brewed that we could almost overlook the two skinny women with their hermes scarves , upper west nasal tones and permanently uptilted noses sitting next to us and complaining how uncouth tourists have overtaken the place . well , excuse me . food - N . N stars . . . superb italianate breakfasts with creative twists that make them nearly sublime ambiance - N . N stars . . . open taverna makes a nice fit in a trendy neighborhood , some of the clientele less so service - N stars . . . punctual , attentive and not judgy total - N stars . . . pretentious customers need not apply
i love the food here . il bambino is consistently good and an astoria staple . unfortunately , i have a hubs with a high gluten intolerance , so their bread filled menu is not an optimal choice for date night . however , when i do get to indulge , i enjoy every second of the savory food items presented to me . their paninis and crostinis are a treat for my taste buds , and the service has always been friendly and efficient . i ' ve yet to have a bad experience here . their backyard patio is wonderful during the spring , summer , and fall months . it ' s a very calm and intimate setting for a delightful lunch or dinner . writing this review is making me crave il bambino ' s food - that ' s how good it is ! 
i love indian food and have eaten at many indian restaurants kochi is one of the best indian restaurants i have been too . it offers a unique , savory and authentic menu . the people are very nice and accommodating as well . the prices are on par with most other establishments . the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and has ample parking in a convenient location . i recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have great food , served by nice people in a nice environment . 
best lunch special of the city ! i still cannot believe how delicious , fresh and affordable is their food ! 
nyc meal with nj price ! definitely go for the tasting menu , which changes seasonally and you can ' t go wrong . the chef staff sommelier gets a N star wine selection N thus for the N star review . 
we came in around N on a sunday , so this review may have been worse had be encountered more loud , undisciplined kids ( honestly now people . . . no need to mollycoddle your children to death , you don ' t want them to turn into wanna-be paris hiltons and britney spears you know ) . food here was great though pricier than i would have thought ( french toast and pancakes should seriously be priced less than " real entrees " like omelettes and such ) . my friend and i split a challah french toast which was amazing and also tried the hummus which was the best i ' ve ever had ( granted it has been a while since i was last in the mediterranean region , so take that comment with a grain of salt ) . what set the hummus apart was the olive oil and onions put in the middle of it . hazlenut hot chocolate was also really good . one bathroom for the whole place ( which is actually moderately sized ) , so beware of lines . cute place , great pick-me-up location after shopping on Nth avenue . 
wandered in here for lunch one day during the summer had the chicken and waffles , and it blew my mind ! the crispy fried chicken paired with the sweetness of maple syrup and the genius kick of hot sauce mixed in delish ! only con i have is that it ' s a cash only establishment , but well worth a trip to the atm for this goodness . can ' t wait to go back ! 
we liked the restaurant and service but they would not take my living social coupon because it was for glastonbury . i thought they were one and the same . my fault
you ' ve got to be kidding . this was one of the worst " restaurants " i ' ve ever spent money and time on . slow service , bad food , poor seasoning choice for the four dishes tried by our party . . . . . . and over priced . never again . 
we went back and tried the bbq . we made reservations and were seated promptly in one of there rooms . service was adequate considering how busy they were . they did forget about us at the end of our meal . and yes like most korean bbq , u need to have at least two to bbq at your table . tons of banchan . complimentary tea . but a bit expensive for the area , almost as expensive as queens . we will definitely be going back to curb my korean cravings . 
my friend once told me about this mythical cart across the street from hilton in midtown . as my friends and i were walking around aimlessly at night , we stumbled upon a cart with a line about N times longer than just about all the other carts , i knew this had to be it . all the reports are true , the white sauce is a godsend . i ' m not quite what they did to it , but it ' s considerably better than any other tzatziki sauce i ' ve had . also , the hot sauce is pretty damn hot so be forewarned . everyone seems to rave about the chicken and rice , but i actually enjoyed the lamb more . well , really it doesn ' t matter , because the key is dousing whatever you have with white sauce . . . 
most legit mexican food i ' ve come across in ny so far . it was packed on a thursday night but we were lucky and got two bar seats right away . everyone was ordering the tacos but i decided to go against the grain and ordered the sopas which i thought were like tacos but with a handmade tortilla . don ' t be stupid like me . . . definitely go for the tacos . all the ingredients tasted really fresh on the sopa - the chicken was juicy , not dry and the lettuce was fresh and crispy but i definitely will order the tacos next time . my bf raved about the pork tacos that he got . the guacamole was also very creamy and portion size was good . everything was on the cheap too , we had dinner here ( N sopas , N tacos and guac ) for a total of N incl tip ! so awesome . the most expensive thing was the guac which was N . also had la dodgers paraphernalia all over the place , i ' m not a fan of the dodgers but it was nice to have a little piece of california over here on the east coast . 
i had chicken platter with rice and pita bread covered with white and red sauce . the meat had flavor but to me it was like any other cart food and wouldn ' t stand in line again for it . 
i can ' t wait to go back ! ! ! not only was the food amazing , so was the service . kelly our server was very helpful and super cool . the mac and cheese was delicious , everyone loved the sweet potato wedges ( it wasn ' t my favorite ) but my friends said it was very good , the corn cakes seemed store bought , they were good but i expected them to taste more home made . as for the meats omg yummy ! ! ! ! everything was amazing ! the beef burnt end was my favorite ! the beef brisket was good but even more delicious with their barbecue sauce , the pulled chicken was one of a kind , the pork belly was my second favorite ! it tasted like chicharron ( for those who love spanish food ) but way better ! the quality of the meat is definitely up there . excellent cant wait to go back ! ! ! ! 
we have become somewhat frequent visitors of N main . . . a charming little spot in the heart of downtown springfield , vt i have yet to have had a dish that i didn ' t enjoy . my very favorite though is the butternut squash ravioli , man oh man , so delicious ! a classic new england pallet of flavors that are excellent . they have a frequent diners card ( which in my opinion every restaurant should have ) and they send you a discount card for your birthday . . a fact that helps me justify spending a little more to have customer service touches like that . things that stop me from posting N stars . . . no free refills on soft drinks ( a huge pet peeve of mine ) price point seems a little high but it ' s the price you pay for dining nice in a little town . i ' d really stick to this as more of an " occasion " restaurant of you ' re sticking to a close budget . . it wont break your bank but it ' s easy to spend N-N dollars after drinks and apps are added in . 
i always appreciate a restaurant that makes their food from scratch . their dumplings are worth getting a table early . if they run out they are out till the next day when they are made fresh again . i have tried several things , all of which have been a delightful surprise . the vegetables included in the dishes are incredibly fresh and not overcooked or steamed . the meat plates are rich with flavors without trying to cover up the meat altogether . highly recommended . very busy on certain nights , reservations are suggested or perhaps calling before going in . i usually call to make sure they have dumplings . 
totally overhyped and overpriced . at least we didn ' t have to wait for a table ! it was a saturday evening at N p . m . so i was surprised that there was no wait , we must ' ve been pretty lucky . maybe not so lucky since we would ' ve gone to ' inoteca down the street instead and have much better food at cheaper price if there were a wait . but there wasn ' t , so we sat down for a dinner . ordered a lamb sausage app ( special ) and a pea soup ( soup of the day . ) both were okay , nothing special . my husband ordered a lamb entree while i went with the trout . the trout was so plain and there was no side dish other than a lemon . anybody could ' ve easily done it in their kitchen or even camping ! my husband ' s lamb , to their credit , was cooked nicely to his order , but again , nothing special . my husband had a glass of their only dessert wine and said it was the worst dessert wine he ' s ever had , didn ' t touch it after one sip . the waiter was nice enough to take it off our bill , which was cool , though the service was spotty in general . we had to ask for bread , took forever to get the waiter ' s attention , etc . don ' t think it was the waiter ' s fault as he was obviously assigned way too many tables . borderline , i can see how this place would be cool for tourists and bridge-and-tunnel crowd , especially if they ' re into celeb-sighting , but there ' s honestly no other reason to eat here . we ' re never going back . 
generous servings of pretty lousy food . i went on a thursday with a date , and with my date were the only table born on this side of wwii . with all of the other restaurants in cranbury , don ' t bother with this dinosaur . 
most delicious pizza . thankfully mancinni ' s is directly across the street from swapxxchange , so we are able to order lunch at least twice a week . the sausage pizza is delicious , as well as some of the most interesting pickled mushrooms . i could eat their pizza every day . . . 
coffee is good . sandwhiches are good . atmosphere is very nice . i really wish this place took credit card . i know it is the hip thing not to accept credit card , but when your sandwhiches are N and your coffee is N , you aren ' t a cheap little coffee shop that should expect people to spend cash at your place . yes , the cc companies charge you , but most orders are over N , so get over it . not that i don ' t have the cash , but i usually only carry around small amounts , and to spend a chunk of it on my morning coffee and sandwhich is tough to swallow . i would definitely go here more often if they took credit card . it is the N deterrent for me and this place . would be N stars if they accepted cc , with the potential for N stars . the quality of the food and coffee is good . 
food is very delicious - especially the waffles but there is always a long wait and i do not get why they don ' t take reservations . i wanted to go there with a group of N people last month but it was nearly impossible . i wish they had more space and a bigger kitchen . 
my neighborhood favorite . what a gem of a place ! everything i ' ve tried here is excellent . and prices are reasonable enough to go often , which i do ( though in general i don ' t try the same restaurant twice - it ' s nyc after all ! but this is an exception ) . i especially love the shrimp tacos , the paella ( which doesn ' t taste like traditional paella but comes with such a good amount of seafood , it gives me a very tasty protein fix ! ) and the date pudding . it ' s a small place and they don ' t take reservations , so you will probably have to wait for a table . but they will take your phone number and call you which is fair . so happy to have this newish addition in the nabe ! 
great place on the ues , the wines are greatly selected , the food its authentic . the staff is friendly and not invasive and the prices are very very fair . i can ' t wait to be back and try more things on the menu . 
yum ! my foodie friend y scored reservations for us at the brand spanking new osteria morini . the food was amazing and i can ' t wait to go back . the service on the other hand was a bit spotty , but then again they just opened ! we had N Npm reservation which was soooo early and incredibly hard to get . thats why i was a bit surprised that there were tables empty throughout the night - perhaps they are still in test mode , making sure everything runs smoothly . one of the great things about visiting a new restaurant is that the chef is usually scoping out the scene . michael white did his rounds in and out of the kitchen . i ' m a big fan . now onto the food ! for appetizers , we had the meatballs which were extremely tender and the funghi polenta . both were delicious . the funghi was very light and perfect as an app . probably not very satisfying though as an entree . for our mains , we shared the gramigna which was hearty , rustic and totally delicious and the seafood macaroni pasta ( can ' t remember the name ) which i though was in a oil based sauce but turns out that it was tomato based and also amazing . all of the pastas are made in house and these two pastas contrasted perfectly . we couldn ' t decide which ones were better ! as for dessert we shared the warm chocolate cake with biscotti gelato in replace of the crema gelato . the cake was cold , tasted like plastic and really not that good . the biscotto gelato on the other hand had a very unique flavor and i could have probably eaten an entire bucket of it . the only downside was the service . we asked the waiter for recommendations and each time he said something different . 
stopped in for a quick mid afternoon snack and was pleasantly surprised . ice had this place on my list for awhile but never had the chance to try it . i sampled the general toss and buffalo balsamic maple which were both terrific . the tenders are nicely breaded , crunchy , hot and fresh . the sauces are very well made . both had the right mix of spicy and sweet . service was really friendly as well . great little neighborhood spot . i ' ll definitely come back with some friends to try more flavors . 
N levels ! resturant , bar area , and upper floor you can have private parties . logistics bathrooms on Nnd and Nrd floor not on first . . sorta weird . tv is on the Nnd and so we watched the nba playoffs from there . they have a theater app , main , and dessert special for N . N . we got this even though it ended at Npm and we went way after . the pork chop was great , salad was standard , and then the dessert was very chocolate and dense . 
excellent find , brisket , out of this world . small restaurant , definitely make a reservation . we will be back . good value for quality of the food . 
secret . i think that ginger place down the block is the same restaurant . their soup dumpling tasted the same and line is like N times shorter . i am wondering what i can say so that it ' s not the same as everyone told you about this place . N . long ass line every day any day . N . order soup dumpling N . share table is common N . order more dumpling to go i started coming here during college and it never stopped . i tried other places and there are second best dumpling and this is the best no doubt . however , if you can justify waiting in the cold for a warm dumpling , do so . there are other place to try like a bit over to east broadway for some authentic chinese dumpling and down the shanghai fried bum is good too . anyway if your asian friend in this case most likely chinese bring you here , just say sure and go ahead with it . never doubt . if you are hungry , it ' s not a good idea to go here cuz you might eat someone before eating anything . good luck . 
more hype than execution i am afraid . we called the restaurant when we driving over since we were a few minutes late ( maybe N ) and told they wouldn ' t hold the spot past N . fine . when we arrived , they were half full . and stayed that way all night . probably need to upgrade the N year old at the door . food was fine but not blow me away good . surprised us since laban liked it and so did philly mag . i an not sure what we missed . portions were on the smaller side , but we don ' t care about that at all . 
pizza was soggy and greasy with poor presentation . . . ingredients were tossed on with no sense of presentation . . . no one pays attention , as i went to pick the pizza up and had to wait in line behind a register that was serving customers ordering in . . . my pizza was behind the other register closest to the door where i was ignored in spite of activitiy nearby . the onion rings were just as greasy as the weathervanes and less tasty . 
the most confounding , irritating waitlist system where we were originally told N-N minutes , only to be told at the one hour mark that people who called ahead go to the front of the line . as to why we weren ' t told up front it could be N mins or an hour and a half ( at one hour four tables of two still ahead of us ) , " i ' m sorry . " so sabrina , that sucks
excellent dinner . great dark woody atmosphere with great energy . good wine , beer and cocktails . we had lots of small plates to start N of N were impressive . we had the hanger steak for dinner which we split , it was really good . the butter cake dessert though , was amazing . i want to bathe in it . i think we might actually go back just for drinks and that dessert . excellent place to go while in town . 
yes , crowded but cozy service was fine food get teh squash that is mandolined served on a hot iron skiller i think it ' s a side . . . it ' s cheesy and sooo good the bread freshly baked is awesome i had the brussel caesar salad- i would get it again ! ! ! ! ! ! the dressing is killer good lamb - good homey , i mean , if you are a good cook - hands down you can replicated it at home . . . but if you aren ' t fond of cooking . . . then get it here experience a lamb shank . they had this filet mignon ' aged ' or pickled . . . ( i forget which one ) in " rags " it was a good piece of beef . . . i think it was the special of the day . . . so if you are lucky- get it ! skip the oven fried french fries . . . . meeeh . . . no big deal the salumi platter too . . . meeeeeh . . . . no big deal save room for the meats ! 
since visiting moto for the first time , i have been plagued by the following dream . tim burton and helena bonham carter move into the apartment next door to me ( preferably the one with the smelly parakeet ) . on sunday nights , we go on double dates . tim wears a prince nez , helena a dirty slip . we amble in the literal shadiness of the jmz , stopping to smell the falafel . we quest for nothing , but questing nothing , find moto . tim and helena immediately feel at home and begin discussing how they will motify the riot of filth and sea foam green that passes for our lobby . " will you be motifying the staircase as well , dear ? " asks helena . " natasha has such a long walk up it every day . " " i shall burtonify it , " he says . we order drinks then food based on yelp reviews . conversation touches upon victorian sex toys as the warm glow of candlelight plays upon helena ' s bosom . a klezmer band enters and encourages us to don goggles ( the aviator kind ) . tim announces his intention to bankroll any business on broadway between marcy and hewes willing to take aesthetic gambles . i imagine a steampunk version of the falafel place . helena and i excuse ourselves to use the bathroom downstairs . she begs me to kiss her but settles for a dirty limerick . 
a family owned casual restaurant . this place has pretty much everything from dining to a bar to pizzas and a small selection of packaged goods . what else can you ask for ? and on top of all that the food is really good you can tell everything is always freshly prepared . pizza is outstanding along with everything else . the fact that the family is so friendly and welcoming really makes it a comfortable atmosphere and they always take care of their customers . 
food was tasty and interesting , in a good way . ambiance pleasant . we will return . 
what can i say nice little cozy place too eat food out of this world . servers were great plenty of food for the price . just dont mine the south philly want to be mob house wifes steering you wife down . there pushing N and trying to act like there N they were the comedy act for the nite watching them talk about everyone walking in instead checking them selfs out even the ones who face was melting off other then that its a must for alll
excellent establishment ! great drinks ( try the sangria ) , and the mushroom burger was very good . thanks ! 
i came here for brunch . the food was nice and well priced but the service wasn ' t the best . we had to ask for things twice and they forgot part of the order . i would still go back though - it wasn ' t a deal breaker . 
it was late and the pizza place was closed , so we stopped here . i ' m glad we did ! the best bbq we ' ve ever had and great environment . 
came at N pm on a monday night and waited about N minutes ? finally got seated right by the door and i could see everyone outside watch us anxiously the whole time . awkward ! pork is great here ! pork buns were good , but don ' t get it if you don ' t like mayo . or ask for no mayo i guess . ramen was good too , didn ' t have to add anything for flavor ! ! i like that you get to see them cook right in front of you . really makes you appreciate the process . and the chefs are really nice ! definitely decide on what you want to order before you sit down to speed things up . only come by yourself or one other person if you don ' t want to wait forever to be seated ! 
so this won ' t be a typical , gushing , detalied review like we typically post . . . we had a very nice meal back in early december to celebrate our anniversary . it was a pleasure from the minute we walked in the door as we were passed into the wine shop and tasted on a wonderful cabernet . we opted to go with the tasting menu and thoroughly enjoyed every bite . the problem that we had occurred when the bill was presented . . . our server was very attentive , he certainly had a style of his own . . . spoke in a charming elizabethan-esque style . . . but listen man , if you ever read this , do not dictate to your customer how they should pay their bill . " cash is king at cafe matisse " really dude ? really ? ? i was holding a gift certificate and my debit card as he delivered this line of epic proportions . . . and ya know what , i was going to tip you over N percent . . . cash or charge , you will still get your money . . . i ' m sorry you won ' t be able to walk out of here tonight with it . seriously though , if i ever said something like this to any of the N tables i wait on over the span of a week . . . i ' d . . . i ' d . . . i can ' t even think of a good metaphor . . . seriously man , i get your schtick , it ' s cool and all . . . but drop that line from your act . oh and i still left him over N percent . . . . on my debit card ! plastic was king that night . 
i hate to give a bad review . . but i was kind of disappointed with food . . nothing special and prices are to high . . umm staff was great and very friendly tho . . and i went around lunch time and i was the only person in the place . . . i kept seeing people going across the street to the other spanish restaurant . . maybe i should have gone there instead . . just being honest
so delicious and colorful and staff is kind the brunch here was a real happening place
this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants . i literally order delivery from here at least Nx per week . the food is always great and the prices are extremely low . 
oh thank you thank you thank you koi japanese chinese for giving wayne an alternative to the tired and lacking china kitchen . we ordered food for take out last night and we were very happy with the flavor , the quantity , the prices , everything ! we ordered the steamed dumplings , bbq ribs , an egg roll , a shrimp roll , general tsao ' s chicken dinner combo ( comes with egg roll and fried rice ) , and beef with broccoli , with brown sauce and brown rice on the side . total price was about N and the food was excellent . the steamed dumplings were awesome - tender , but still had that little " al-dente " feel that i crave , with a nice amount of flavored meat inside . the egg roll and shrimp roll were very good - typical , but still good . hubby ordered the gen . tsao chicken ( he wanted shrimp , but they don ' t make the shrimp for the dinner combo , and after working in the yard all day , i couldn ' t muster up any more energy to order everything separately , so chicken it was ) - it was one of the better gen . tsao ' s he ' s had in a while . there was actually chicken inside the breading , and the sauce had a nice little heat behind the sweetness . . . . the heat snuck up on you after a couple bites . the beef and broccoli was very tender , and the brown sauce had a nice amount of garlic ( warding off any vampires ! ) - the broccoli itself , in both the beef and chicken dishes , was steamed , but still very crunchy . all-in-all we were very happy to have a new ' go-to ' place for our asian cravings . . . . keep up the great job ( and apparently , the d cor is very nice , too - i didn ' t go in for the pick-up , but my family member who did , commented on how nice it looks inside ) . . . . will have to eat in one day . . . . 
tried this place today for the first time and i loved it ! i loved my naked falafel salad with grains and chick peas and yogurt dressing , it was like a much healthier deconstructed falafel platter . the staff is very friendly . they have wonderful looking smoothies and fresh squeezed juices . every item they have is displayed with calorie content and the portion sizes are hearty and filling . it ' s really nice to have this place in the neighborhood and i ' m really excited to go back , probably tomorrow , but maybe later today . 
nice place good sandwich too saucy for me lay off the sauce and ill update my rating ! 
the mark w . diaries - part four friday my name is mark , and , " i have a cunning plan " . i have decided that i will show up at the popular yelp hang-out , and try to take advantage of anyone who has had enough alcohol to find me attractive . if yelpers continue to thumb their nose at me ( why isn ' t that listed under the don ' ts in maxim magazine ' s guide to bar conversations ? ) , i will try and hook up with any of the " stupid girls " that stand out in the crowd when yelpers are around . if everything fails , at least i can feel up some random girl ' s bottoms , as the place gets crowded on a weekend . i rub my hands with glee . . . naughty , naughty . saturday life stinks . my cunning plan went wrong on a fantastic scale ! first , the friendly bouncer laughed when he saw my doctor id . and , kept it . then as i walked inside , i stepped on the N inch high heels of a girl who tripped and fell on her face . in the process , she also threw up all over my feet , which was a first as normally i have started chatting up a girl when this happens . as i walked over her motionless frame to make my way to the bar , i noted with regret that she had the word " juicy " on her ass . damn , one target ' wasted ' . wait , let me chalk that to ' maybe ' , i think . i ordered my N lychee martini ( from the tips left at the bar , hehe ) and tried to find someone to make small talk . i saw a small group where dr d is holding court . i stand behind and listen to him . he seems to be talking sense , from the approving nods . as he ended with " guys on yelp , be cool , be cool " i walked over to him and introduced myself . mark w what would you advise me ? dr . d that ' s a tough question , mark . you should probably hang around bars , instead of on talk threads . mark w why ? dr . d because , noisy and crowded bars like this are perfect for people like you . loud music and alcohol help people without any substance connect with likeminded folks . in bars , you fill up what you don ' t hear or understand with what you expect to hear . just keep a strong body language - smiling and nodding , alternatively , every few seconds . mark w will that work for me ? dr . d that depends . " who do you attract " ? mark w generally , very clingy women . one would think after the paid hour is up , they would leave . but , dammit , they have no brains . hearing this , dr . d disappears and i tried to make my way to someone else . i recognized the famous yelper , " he who goes poof in a cab " , ( hwgpiac ) and greet him . mark w . ( acting cool , tilting head ) ' ssup ? hwgpiac ( penetrating eyes ) do you know paul verlaine ? mark w was he here ? basic instinct , right ? hwgpiac no , that ' s paul verhoeven . i was talking about the poet , you doofus ! forget it ! i see we couldn ' t possibly have anything in common . as he starts to leave , i give up the pretence and fall on my feet . mark w please teach me , master sensei ! i am in awe of your skills ! i , mark w , will be your grateful slave forever . hwgpiac i believe in integrity above all . you have none . mark w but , don ' t you also believe in good karma ? hwgpiac yes , but , . . . . . . ok , one advice only before i go poof whatever you do , do it with style and class ! poof those words ring in my ears as i walk towards the large table of yelpers . must be classy and stylish , i repeat to myself . i spot " she who has two billion faces " . she seems friendly and offers me some excellent calamari . i try to impress her that i am also a foodie , and thus one to be respected . mark w you know , i was at red hook ball fields after reading the reviews and talk threads . she did you like it ? mark w . yes , but i was disappointed that they didn ' t have my favorite dish " tacos with chorizos " it isn ' t exactly clear what happened next , but before i could explain my preference in sauces , i vaguely recollect hearing the words " shank , shank , shank " behind me , and found myself lying on the sidewalk outside verlaine . i got up groggily and recognized another famous yelper , villanus meatballus maximus . despite his yelp profile picture , he seems a kindly soul . i shared my dating predicament with him . mm maybe you should think about joining the ranks of the omnisexuals ? mark w who are these people ? mm they are also called pwltgfewws mark w sorry ! i couldn ' t hear that in the noise of the traffic . who are these people ? mm i said these are people who varrrrrooooooooommmmmmmmmm ! ( special thanks to all the yelpers for their tireless contributions on the threads and reviews , providing the plot narration devices ) 
been a few times before and really enjoyed it . a cool place . but this time ' twas not the same . the bar staff only deigned to serve us . not cool ! not nyc . 
my experience at abc kitchen was totally underwhelming . when i first walked in , i was impressed by the space decor . it ' s linked to abc carpets , so it ' s no surprise that everything is made up like a home garden magazine . beautiful lighting , furniture , and an interesting combination of two-tops large round tables perfect for bachelorette parties . we were seated by a nice enough hostess , but i noticed there was no greeting when we first walked in . i feel like it should be a standard to make your guests feel welcomed and guided when they first walk in . our server didn ' t get to us right away and when he did , i wasn ' t even sure he was our server . he didn ' t make any introductions , and he was at best apathetic throughout our meal . i expect a lot better service when we ' re paying these prices , and from the perspective of a former server , this was definitely not up to par . we proceeded to order - roasted pear salad , apples , mammuth cheese and pecan vinaigrette - cavatelli with sausage - fresh ricotta , crispy prosciutto and dates whole wheat pizza - chocolate cake with malted ganache toasted marshmallow icing - warm apple pie with cinnamon gelato the salad was actually the best part of the meal . it was a delicious combination of flavors fresh ingredients , and the cheese was to die for . i mean , you can ' t really go wrong with pears , apples cheese with fresh greens . it was basically downhill from there . the cavatelli was way too salty and the presentation was mediocre . i felt like i was eating a bowl of maggots , and the sausage was grounded and chopped in such a way that i couldn ' t even savor the texture or flavor . the pizza was eh . i wouldn ' t order pizza from them -- go to luzzo ' s or roberta ' s if you ' re looking for out-of-this-world specialty pizzas . the dates gave it a nice sweet twist , but other than that , i couldn ' t taste the prosciutto -- just got lost in there , and the ricotta was bland . i was looking forward to the desserts at this point to redeem the rest of the meal , and it completely fell flat . i love desserts and i wanted to cry because it was so boring . the chocolate cake was way too sweet and dense . the marshmallow icing was pretty much inedible . i love chocolate cake and i couldn ' t even eat this . the apple pie was terrible . the crust was not flaky buttery at all . . . it tasted like some dried out vegan shit gone wrong . i wasn ' t even sure if they had any apples in the pie , since it was so overwhelmed by the yucky crust . even the gelato wasn ' t enough to bring it back . . . in fact , i can ' t even remember it , it was so forgettable . wouldn ' t pay N to eat here , much less the N i ended up spending . forget it ! 
wish they baked bread . got a boring cookie twice . whole thing seems pretty unnecessary
the food is amazingly delicious . it makes the parking hassle and the cash-only policy completely worth it . i ' ve never been disappointed eating here ! 
i came back by myself before an evening event , and loved this just as much . i sat in the corner at a table , ordered some happy hour wine and some happy hour fried cheese balls , and actually got a decent amount of walter mead read ! could i ask for a better way to spend the late afternoon ? nope . 
good pizza and friendly service . nice for a group of friends look for a casual dining place . solid N stars . 
omg . . where do i start ? ! ! the food is so yummy ! ! the other brazilian spots around here need to step it up because this is it baby . . . yeah ! ! ordered roast and fried chicken ribs collars greens received awesomeness ! ! 
we placed our order online and was told N-N minutes , with a price of N . N . when called to check on the order , we were told that they never received the order and would just be starting it now , N minutes after we originally ordered ! when receiving the order finally an hour and a half later , we were asked to sign for N . N . when questioned , the delivery man informed us that if we sign he will honor the N . N because that is what we originally signed for and were told the price would be . when calling the store , the lady was extremely rude and told me " whatever , " you signed for it already and you got your food . i told her this is no way to speak to a customer , and she repeated " whatever , bye . " and hung up on me . i will never be ordering from this restaurant again . there customer service is terrible and they will charge you more than you originally are being asked to pay after you receive your food . disgusting ! 
i give the N stars . the burger is tasty and cooked just right . the history of this place is written on the walls , literally . which gives you something to do if you feel a vandalous mood coming over you . the burger is on pepperidge farm bread toasted in old ass toaster , cheese spread , onion and tomato , don ' t you even dare ask for ketchup ! ! ! no fries , chips or potato salad . the burger is cooked vertically by flame in an oven that was built in N something . kinda cool . i would say stop by , try it out and just like every other food , some will hate it , some will love it and some will just say meh . happy burger hunting ! ! 
our last night in ny after a wonderful N week vacation in south america , we stumbled upon this place for our last dinner . walking distance from our hotel , i loved that it was away from the tourist area and filled with such a wonderful local vibe . the tapas were all amazing and the summer night was perfect for dining outside . we ordered the deviled eggs , lamb skewers , garlic shrimp , and the beet salad . while the food and service was great , the portions felt rather small , even for tapas . fyi - there ' s a great pizza spot to pick up a few slices on the way back if you ' re staying at the hudson hotel . we had to make a stop cause we knew the food wasn ' t enough . 
the food is delicious , the coffee is strong ( even the iced ! ) , and the atmosphere is awesome . . . the staff can seem a little aloof
hmmmm . the food is nice enough . but at this price . . . not worth it quite frankly . had the buffalo calamari which was good . . . but just calimari in a wings style sauce for N . and then the salmon and white fish combo . all local . again , nice enough but nothing that would justify the very steep prices in here . i feel maybe they have aspirations to be more than they are . bring prices down N- N per dish and i would have given this a N . 
great place . love the vibe . the store itself seems so like your at home . i had chicken waffle with a side of home fries mac cheese . great meal . would totally visit again
i ' ve eaten in and ordered take-out from nan zhou and will never eat hand drawn noodles from any other place . they ' re consistently good ( even after being left in the fridge for a day or two as leftovers ) . so far i ' ve only tried the ox tail , and ox spare rib noodle soups and they have been amazing . i still have yet to try the noodles with peanut sauce that my boyfriend told me is pretty damn good as i ' m such a big meat lover ) 
of the N im a pat ' s fan , i usually eat pizza steak ' s and geno ' s doesn ' t have any variety . other places are higher on the list for cheesesteak ' s but will walk over to get one of these when people are visiting
i enjoyed my meal . the food was good i had topaz puffs , crispy duck salad , krabs , chicken satay and were all delicious . the waiting time is average . i would definitely stop by another day . 
it was good to try , but the portions are small , and i like small portions . not actually enough to really get a good bite . the pita was meh , and the sauces were the same . i like hummus place or yummus in bushwick better . i ' d even say i like maoz better . . . at least i can make my own sandwitch . 
i love this place ! very cool vibe - i felt like i was eating on the set of the brady bunch ! the staff was so cool and accommodating - i was in a party of N and they had no problem making room for us and gave us a pretty sweet set up . the service was quick and our waiter was so nice ! the drink menu is awesome and the drinks were strong . the food was very good - interesting menu - deviled eggs as an app - done and done ! ! 
if friday rolls around and you haven ' t had the time to make those wonderful kickoff to your weekend plans , go to just jake ' s ! every friday they have a live cover band and it ' s the perfect atmosphere to let loose , enjoy the music , and grab some drinks . they also offer different drink specials throughout the week and have an outside patio thats nice for the warmer nights . i know i have definitely enjoyed some good times here especially with their N . N blue moons . they do have cheaper beer specials , but i ' m just a blue moon fan ! this is a place that all of my friends agree to go to and we can usually get a decent group coming . i am not a fan of their N dollar cover for the band , but i have sneaked by a few times ) 
cute place with a nice range of seating options . we went early ( like N N on a saturday ) and elected to sit near the open window , which allowed for some enjoyable people watching . we ordered garlic bread to start ( we were starving ) and i got the perfectly cooked gnocchi with butter and sage for my main . had a glass of the penedes with dinner and another with tiramisu for dessert . i ' m a bit of a tiramisu connoisseur and this was good but didn ' t knock my socks off . definitely a heavy , carby meal , but sometimes that ' s just what you ' re in the mood for . i think this would be a great mid-winter place . service was good for most of the meal , but our guy kind of disappeared toward the end . we waited a long time to get a receipt ( this was technically business travel , so could have expensed it ) and then he eventually just brought back change and ran off before we realized there was still no receipt . rather than wait another N minutes for him to orbit back , we just left . oh well . still a nice experience . maybe not a destination place , but i ' d definitely recommend a trip if you ' re in the area . 
i went to locanda verde for a business lunch on a sunny summer friday . though it was hot outside , my colleague and i opted to sit at one of the sidewalk tables , which happened to be in the shade for most of lunch . . . perfect . we ordered and were able to eat all in an hour and N minutes . . . which really suited our busy schedules , though we never felt rushed . the meal was wonderful . . . authentic italian dishes . i loved the scampi ravioli with rock shrimp . a side order of the broccoli rabe , a glass of the prosecco and a piece of fresh bread complemented the entr e . go here with friends , or a date , for a great meal ! 
the diced egg plant that is put on the table for free is to die for . . . . so is the rustica pizza with the eggplant on top actually my fiance ' s regular pizza was amazing too , i think its the best pizza i ever had . . . i got the scallops over a bed of diced veges that was amazing . . . even my salad was amazing . . . i think this is my new favorite restaurant , plus its bring your own , so you don ' t need to spend a boat load of money . . . . i can ' t wait to try their sister restaurant down the block ! ! ! 
tamarind bbq sauce was amazing . had the pulled pork and had to add on another order of fries , not bc i was still hungry but bc i needed to have more of the sauce . i strongly recommend checking it out . best pulled pork bbq sand which i ' ve had in philadelphia so far ( N years in ) . 
lupa ' s food has impressed me in the past . but never its service . and tonight was absolutely embarrassing . my boyfriend made reservations for a Npm table for two , and we were turned away at the door told that " you aren ' t in the system . " of course , there is little we could do to argue with their apparently infallible " system " ( and the people who use it ) , and the smarmy attitude of the boy at the door and the woman on the other end of the reservations line insinuated that we were trying to pull a fast one . thank god that this city has plenty of excellent italian , so we won ' t have to bother with the attitude at lupa again . 
what a comfortable and interesting space ! the design is beautiful and a great addition to the east rock yale neighborhoods . we have tried many dishes at this point and have been thrilled with everything we have ordered . some of our favorites include the massaman curry beef , the schezuan fish , the chinese green beans and the eggplant . be sure to try the dumplings and noodle soups as well ! ! be sure to check out the wines by the glass - they are always stand out selection ! and although yelp advertises that they only serve beer and wine , they do also have a classic cocktail list . we will be back very soon ) 
italian food is kind of a high bar for me because it ' s pretty easy to cook it yourself . this place was fine , but not amazing . the eggplant parm appetizer was good as was the buccatini . it was actually lovely . but the gnocchi was very mediocre . i don ' t get what the fuss is about . all in all this restaurant is an inoffensive cute choice but the food is okay , not spectacular by any means . N stars seemed harsh , but N seems a little generous . the waitstaff is lovely so i rounded up . 
awesome ! visited when i came back home to ct on vacation . tried to buy everything on the menu . . lol
good food and other then sticking seven of us at a table that could barely fit four at one time the customer service is fine . i find myself frequenting this establishment at least once a month and enjoy myself each and every time . 
ordered from luzzo ' s on a friday night per reading great reviews on yelp . told me it would take an hour which i thought was a good sign as it was clearly in demand . have to say some of the worst pizza i ' ve had in nyc ! by the time it got to me it was really cold and wet and slimy . as i ' d try to take a piece out the minimal toppings would slide off my soggy slice . not to mention it was pricey . cost N . N with tip for a large with N toppings ! will never order from there again . so , not good and so disappointing ! 
first of all , too small of a facility for a restaurant . customers and workers have to squeeze by each other to get by . second , took me N minutes to get some food ! come on ! ! the N dollar skewers were horrible ! ! no choices what so ever . food wasn ' t all that good . i had to buy more food just to get full . also , who was my waiter ? i had over N different people serve me and give out drinks ! i had to wave down a server for some assistance ! never again ! two thumbs down for me ! 
oh juniors , how i love thee . this is an awesome place to pick up breakfast , lunch or dinner . the proximity to times square and many major hotels is perfect . i particularly enjoyed the yogurt parfait , the bacon and cheese omelette and the french toast . it really does get crowded in here but i only had to wait about fifteen minutes for my party of five to sit down for breakfast . everyone on the waitstaff is very friendly and the bright orange interior just puts you in a good mood . if your looking for a place to eat then stop in ! you won ' t be disappointed with juniors . p . s when your leaving it is very likely that the main entrance will be crowded with hoards of people so , take the back exit located in the back right corner of the restaurant , through the red curtains . 
we took my husband ' s dad here for father ' s day and it was absolutely delightful . the interior is adorable and the crepes are divine ! i got one with scallops and tomato sauce , my husband stuck with something non adventurous ( egg cheese ham ) and my father in law got the steak au poivre . we all left satisfied and ready to return ! 
an excellent addition to the neighborhood - a cut above the standard pizza fine-italian food joints that surround the area . well decked out , good wine options and the food was delicious - the salad with grapefruit is very refreshing . service was attentive - other reviewers must have hit a bad night for a newly-opened spot . certainly recommended . 
went to barbuto because my husband took a cooking class with waxman . . . . heard the chicken was the greatest anyone has ever tasted . honestly , out local grocery store ' s version was better ( more moist , tastier ) . the chicken did had a perfectly crispy skin which was delicious . the risotto is fantastic , although our friend thought it was too salty . she also tried the kale which she loved , but i thought it was just so-so husband ordered the skirt steak , again mixed reviews between delish too salty . tried pound cake with rhubarb strawberry chocolate and hazelnut mousse ice cream cake--- both we ' re good , but not out of this world . overall the food wasn ' t memorable , but the service was for all the wrong reasons . ordered a second diet coke cheese plate --- the waiter forgot both . when we brought this to his attention , he could care less , didn ' t feel remorseful or apologetic at all . weird . i will say its a cool atmosphere , open air , right on the corner . 
our visit to mama rosa ' s last night will be the first of many . the food , the service and the prices are great . we met gino the owner and were immediately made to feel like we were old friends and part of the family . from the appetizers ( asparagus with roasted red peppers and mozzarella cheese , fried tomatoes and zucchini ) to the mains ( broiled mixed seafood , eggplant parm , pizza ) all the way to the canollis- everything was fresh , delicious and just the way we ordered it ! we highly recommend this family restaurant- and very much look forward to our next visit ! 
ya know rose water , you charming little brooklyn thing , you made my sunday . this is a completely whimsical space serving a solid solid brunch . for park slope you have character . you are not hip , you are not sparse , you are not too full of yourself . you are tasty , simple , hard working and delightful ( and i ' m a bitch who rarely uses a word like delightful but you are such a warm fluffy butterfly , i wanted to say it ) . how have i overlooked you all these years ? also no one can ever sell me on a " sake cocktail " but i was jonesing so badly for a bloody mary . i tried it with sake and i actually enjoyed it . yay wasabi ! i ' ll be back . front of the house a little frantic but i can deal . they gave me a snuggie for god-sake while dining in the somewhat enclosed porch area . it was a nice sunday . thank you rose water . 
re allie p ' s review below " real italian charcuterie " ? i think you mean salumi . charcuterie is french . regardless , asking for " charcuterie " on your pizza is akin to asking for your big mac au jus . pizza is one of the glories of italian-american cuisine , precisely because it is earthy , hugely satisfying , and unpretentious . here ' s a tip next time you want to have a meal you would probably describe as being " classy " , don ' t go to a pizzeria . 
my family and i have been frequenting baja ' s for years now and i can ' t say that we ' ve ever left disappointed . they don ' t necessarily have the most extensive tequila selection which is probably the only negative aspect of the entire dining experience , and is a fact i can certainly overlook . they have a salsa bar which is highly original . it has six different salsa selections , ranging from very mild to quite spicy , so there is an option for everyone . the nachos are always delicious , topped with pico de gallo , cheese , and guacamole . the chile relleno comes with two stuffed poblano peppers , beans , rice , and guacamole . it ' s a huge portion and more than likely you ' ll be taking some to go . all in all i ' ve been very pleased with baja ' s over the years and look forward to frequently returning with my family
absolutely delicious . if you ' re looking for authentic mexican , this is not the place for you ! neither is anywhere in vt , as far as i can tell . but if you want something a little more hipster and a little less greasy , you ' ll be happy . ingredients were fresh and the black beans were especially great ! 
free sangria ! i went on a sunday night and they had free unlimited sangria . i ' m not talking about just one , but seven different varieties to choose from ( albeit the mojito one wasn ' t the best ) . they ' re tasty and generally done right . the unlimited biscuits they bring to the table is like crack . i was stuffed by the time my entree came out . there was also great purple ( yes purple ) hummus that came as a dip for the bread . both went well together . as for the food , i had the seafood paella . this dish was very generous in its portions . i couldn ' t even finish it all . the paella was quite good and the seafood was done very well . the lobster that came with the paella was succulent and perfect . i also had the calamari . this is not your typical calamari . this calamari is glazed in a special sweet sauce and sesame seeds that makes it crunchy and delicious . overall , i had an excellent experience ( whether it was the food or the unlimited drinks is anyone ' s guess ) at calle ocho . highly recommended . 
best said by public enemy . . . don ' t believe the hype ! its good pizza but there are better N slices out there
i came here for my birthday . it was incredible ! the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was outstanding ! this is as good as " french style " food gets ! their brunch . . . forget about it ! i had the duck dish and it literally melts in your mouth . will definitely be back again and again . . . 
yum ee . i had the artisan cheese plate , the soup of the day , and shared the kale salad with my daughter . all huge portions and all was fabulous . my daughter had the house made ricotta - wow ! a little pricey but all well worth it . 
ruth ' s chris is one of my favorite steakhouses as you know that you will consistently end up with a delicious steak ! love their chop salad , mojitos and their strip steak ! also , they mike a fine after dinner espresso martini ! 
really good italian pulled pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone , but like others have said , a bit on the dry side . their lines are huge so when they pull apart the pork , it ' s still hot , so guess what happens . . . all the juices evaporate from the meat . i know it ' s not their fault they can ' t wait to let it rest so the juices distribute back into the meat , but i think that would make it a N and not N star . tony luke ' s on the other hand has the juiciest italian pork sandwich and i ' d take that over dinic ' s any day . but this place is still solid if you ' re in reading terminal area . 
these guys seriously need to stop coming to ynhh so often . every time i see their truck parked on cedar i have to repress the urge to sprint over and order a bunch of their delicious cupcakes . i ' m only sometimes successful . . . out of the ten or so flavors i ' ve tried , my favorites thus far are the snickers , oreo explosion , and the strawberry cheesecake . they ' re all good though . i ' ve never had a dry or tasteless cupcake here and their frosting cake ratio is just the way i like it . 
as good as it gets -- authentic , casual portugese food with great flair and awesome chops . for N N a meal you get a boatload of delicious with a cast of locals , song , and great dessert ( cappucinos flan are clutch ) to boot . 
went to extra virgin when it first opened for saturday brunch , and got seated outside right away ( thank you for that , fellow yelpers , you told me to do it that way ! ) . coffee was delicious , mimosas were standard . i got the virgin frittata , amazing , and they get bonus points for giving me egg whites at no extra charge . beau got the basque scramble , which he said was quite tasty . generous portions and fresh ingredients . i definitely recommend sitting outside if you can , it ' s a lovely spot to people watch ! i take away a star because despite the fact that they took our orders at the exact same time as everyone else sitting outside , it somehow took almost N minutes longer for our food to come out than every other table out there with us . it gave us extra time to watch the passers by , but i was a bit hungry by the time i got my food . it sounds like this is a fluke , because the service is generally reviewed pretty well . i ' ll chalk it up to a busy saturday morning . luckily , the food was of a caliber that made me forget the wait pretty quickly . 
oh boy , were we in for a treat or what ! ? since our first trip to nola last year , we ' ve been dying for the flavors up here . sugar freak freakishly reminded us the good food that we had down there . the gumbo was simply full of bursting flavors , and most importantly , it was not mushy . there was a bite to it . the vegetarian muffuletta was simply , " i can ' t believe it ' s not meat ! " i had a quarter of the muffuletta at central grocery in nola , while that was sensational , this vegetarian variant was even better it tasted so lush without the guilt . and yes , there was the drippy olive oil , something that you have to experience eating a muffuletta . dessert must-have popcorn pudding with salted caramel ( dump cake ) . what the heck is that ? i want to slather it all over my fat belly right now . all the servers were super friendly and sweet . for once , i ain ' t bitching ! 
had the truffle burger with added cheddar and bacon , and with spicy fries . the burger was perfect , with close to the best buns i have ever had . the fries was crispy and tasted delicious . we knew the place was byob , but since we are not familiar with williamsburg we did not bring anything ( since we did not know where to buy it ) . this was not a problem though , we got plenty of ice water for free . the waiters was constantly walking around checking the tables and refilling the glasses . really good experience . it will not be the last time we visit this place . 
i live in orange county , california and my bf just moved to ny . we were looking for a spot for dinner to get some good seafood . found fish on yelp and decided to try it out . it was exactly what we were looking for . cute , romantic , yet casual . food has really good . i had the king crab legs , my boyfriend had the surf n turf , we shared both between us . was delicious and fresh . im very interested in going back to try the oysters and happy hour specials , those look like a great deal . can ' t wait to go again . oh , and the staff was very friendly . we were seated right away on a thursday night round N Npm
after a day of shopping , i visited yasuda . i had a lot of shopping bags with me , and they put them begin the hostess desk so i didn ' t have to carry them to my table . walking into this place felt very serene . their rice is the best sushi rice i ever had ! i loved the flavor , and it wasn ' t too dry or too moist . . . it was perfect ! the service was impeccable ! ( something i don ' t say often about restaurants . ) the fish was fresh , and our food came out quickly . 
i ' m surprised by all the positive reviews . the food is overpriced , small portions , and not all that tasty . i went there over the weekend ( after valentine ' s day ) and had a spaghetti dish and it tasted like take out . with all the great italian restaurants in brooklyn , don ' t waste your time or money at sud . 
we went here for dinner . we ordered the fried flounder , penne with broccoli rabe and eggplant pasta . all the orders were huge . the penne was ok but needed tomato sauce . fried flounder and eggplant pasta were pretty good . a bit pricey for a diner . but , service was pretty friendly ! 
for over N years they have serve decent good food at a fairly reasonable price . but that ' s the best of the place . the service here is consistently poor and they have the most cold and arrogant owners especially the son who has apparently taken over much of the operation . they love the business from all of the hs kids after school events and every friday night - but they always have an excuse not to donate to the kids for hs charitable events . you will never see the owners or host refilling coffee during a busy breakfast . they never ask how are things and when yu complain about a well done burger order med rare - " oh well - sorry " . i go because it is convenient when we are pressed for time . when i have time i go to other diners a few miles away . my advice - stay away- maybe someday they will get the hint to improve . 
i don ' t go nuts for mexican-american fast food , but i like things that taste good . i think the grilled chicken and pork are very good and add flavor to the tacos , burritos , etc . on the other hand , the trimmings are nothing special . their bowl of rice and beans is sub-standard hispanic fare , and the cheese quesadilla is tasty , but easy to recreate at home . in light of all the tasteless tacos and burritos i ' ve had though , this place is good if you order meat in your dish . 
i ' ve been going to this pizzeria since they ' ve been open . their lasagna is very good . their pizza is huge and it ' s great . the owner and his employees are very friendly and profeasional . really good for a sit down with family and friends . 
after the elite event last week , our party of four wandered down the street to try mix . it was definitely the right time to try out a new place we had each had a drink or two and were sufficiently starving ! mix was able to seat us right away at cute wooden table near the bar . we ordered three small pizza ' s for four of us , N garlic knots , and a bottle of wine . the pizzas were good , but not fantastic . we ordered the white , the margarita , and the meaty one . they came out pretty quickly and were piping hot . the bottle of wine was cheap , which really made me happy , and two of us downed it pretty quickly . the whole place was clean , simple and pleasant . our waitress was enthusiastic and entertaining . we would have stayed longer , but our meter was expiring . 
ran in here starving and walked out with N great falafel sandwiches and a little more knowledge on the falafel making process thanks to the helpful dude working the counter . the food was fresh , very tasty and the price was right . i will be seeking this place out again for another round of falafel the next time i ' m in the area . 
the service is strange . multiple waiters asked us for our order multiple times , just minutes apart . the main waiter was incessant in his frequency . while they asked us multiple times for appetizers , they didn ' t bring us waters and i practically had to hunt them down to get myself another beer . the food is pretty good but i won ' t come back . 
i came here after reading that refinery N said this place has one of the best margaritas in the city . well , i tried it . and yeah , it ' s pretty freaking awesome . if you like spicy drinks you have to try it-- the jalapeno grapefruit margarita . the first sip is a little scary , but it ' s a really interesting , enjoyable marg . i ' m also a sucker for a grapefruit garnish , so . also- this place has no street sign so just look for the quirky , nameless place . 
very nice food ! ! ! 
great homemade pasta , and a great delivery spot . 
the food was mediocre at best . the meat is stale and chewy . not worth the price . that said , if you decide to do it anyways , do not let the line scare you , it goes quick , easily N people a minute . 
food drink- amazing cocktails and beers . went at N pm on thursday with a friend and hung out until our other friends trickled in from work . we made it there right on time for happy hour . awesome beer selection- everything on draft was N except chimay and their cask beer . i enjoyed the kelso nut brown ale as well as kelso winter lager . spiked hot apple cider was on special for N and was delicious with spiced rum . also got to try the pickle martini- fantastic and my friend ' s basil martini which was amazing . not sure if the martinis were a reduced price for happy hour or not . there was some confusion about that . eventually we ordered some food . . . have only good things to say about their mac and cheese , fried pickles and fries . friends enjoyed the portobello burger and sweet afton burger . . . they enjoyed those . only minor complaints were that the food was a bit pricey . i chose the place for drinks and atmosphere so i personally didn ' t mind . atmosphere- candle lit , cozy interior- lots of brick and dark wood . adorable christmas tree , wreath and white lights adorn the walls . staff- super helpful and nice . before it got busy , our server chatted with us and described all her favorite cocktails which was great . also was very honest with which cocktails were really small and which were bigger . was the perfect choice for a spot to meet up before a friend had to catch a Npm flight from lga . will definitely return next time i ' m in astoria ! 
the food is very good , prices are very good , but the service is god awful . waiters and management are very rude and arrogant . i will never go back again for this reason . 
amazing food and an amazing atmosphere that complimented it . i loved it . their eggs benedict is simply awesome . i loved that they used local farmers for everything . 
i found this place walking around and they have incredible handmade sausages ! you must try the brisket , jerk , love them both . all the mustards and ketchup are handmade . if you have the opportunity you should try the banana mustard . i found it amazing and wished they jarred it so i can take it home . all the sauerkraut , potato salads , kim chi and sides are incredible and as well made in house . the beer list was extensive and surprisingly well thought out . the staff was cool , fun and aiming to please . definitely one of my new favorites for the slope ! ! you can always get a hamburger or a slice but a handmade sausage is pretty awesome . 
best desi food in new jersey shalimar , i went on mother day with my family to eat food was really good ' kids love the place soon i ' m gonna do my N years old daughter birthday . 
love this place ! have now been a few times and its always been a great experience . food is delicious - i ' ve had the turkey burger delish ! servers are super friendly and they ' ll bring you your food as you ' d like , i . e . don ' t like onions , no problem . very happy to have a place like this in the neighborhood , with a cool and comfortable interior and even a lovely patio for when its warmer out . 
it ' s really not all that . especially for what they are charging for the quality and for the portions ! i can get just as good of a cheesesteak at subway for half the price and a larger sandwich at that . i could tell my fries were cooked hours ago and reheated back in the deep fryer . N . N for a regular old cheeseteak and a small cup of reheated fries was a complete waste of and i will not be back . 
 ' twixt such friends as we , few words suffice i don ' t eat pizza anywhere else unless i have to . great pizza . great atmosphere . great wine . great beer ( a can of founder ' s all-day-ipa for N bucks has been on the menu recently ) . if you want pasta , entrees or tacky appetizers , this is not the place . the pizza ovens and recipes are imported from italy . friendly owners researched the hell out of pizza the margherita is excellent ( N ) and consistently so . doesn ' t need toppings , but i ' ve tried others and the cherry-stone clam and parsley-butter variant more than once . heavier , but very very good . for dessert , split the nutella banana walnut calzone and a side of vanilla ice-cream with a friend . the two of you may fight over this . quality means you may have to wait for a table on weekends . or in the evenings in general . there ' s no delivery . takeout is usually ready in N minutes . 
this restaurant was truely lovely . my boyfriend and i had an unforgetable night at little owl . as soon as we got there the staff and ambiance was so welcoming . they were playing great music and the whole vibe was just so alive and charming . our table wasn ' t quite ready so the hostess offered us a complimentary lass of prosecco while we waited ( the wait ended up being less than N minutes ) . here is what we ordered N appetizers avocado tomato prosciutto salad - excellent ! meatball sliders - i was hoping these lived up to the hype and they N did ! so juicy and tasty - cooked to perfection ! clams - tied with catch most delicious clams i have ever had we each ordered an entree i had the artic char which was incredible . this is not even a fish i usually order but it was excellent . i have been thinking craving it every night since we ate here . my bf had the lamb chops , which he seems to really enjoy . a bottle of malbec - delicious ! 
we have been to misconduct more than a new times . just to grab a bite to eat or wait for friends . for a bar , their menu is amazingly diverse . i really enjoyed a special they had - grilled mahi mahi " cheesesteak " with tomatoes , caramelized onions , and a beer cheese sauce on a sarcone ' s roll . great number of beers on tap . at least N televisions ! crowded on the weekends , but service was great . overally , this is a nice spot to catch the game , and eat . i probably wouldn ' t recommend me this for cheap drinking though - the prices are a bit steep . 
cookshop is my neighborhood ( comfort zone ) go to . service is always reliable food is quite delicious . my only complaint now is getting a table these days with the influx of highline tourists is a bummer . waiting N-N minutes w o res and showing up early w res hoping to get seated earlier no dice for dinner . i also love the lunch chicken salad is the best . 
i have worked in the restaurant industry for a few years now and i have never seen an establishment run out of so many menu items so early in the night . the servers are rude and not compliant when mistakes are made . the servers are not aware of what is going on in the kitchen . the lack of communication between the servers and the kitchen staff has left my group of friends and i in shock . the night began enjoyable . they seated us quickly and brought out our appetizers in a timely manner . N minutes after our food was ordered , we were told that some of the food items had run out . when were were asked to be compensated for our disappointment , we were told that " nothing in this culture is free " . i am not really sure what that means or indicates but i am positive that this was not the appropriate response . they servers continued on to explain some bull shit story without any reason or rhyme as to why their mistakes had occurred . furthermore , don ' t come here . don ' t bring your friends . don ' t bring your family . don ' t waster your time
came here at approximately N N on a saturday evening . we were given a wait time of approximately N-N minutes , which was accurate . the food here was pretty good . overall , while i did not get the impression that the cuisine was ' distinctly ' thai , overall everything was done really well , and the service provided was great . wound up also ordering the mango with sticky rice , which was good . the only downside to this place is that the restaurant itself is pretty cramped , and that wait times seem to get a little long . 
love this place . great mood , great service , great food . kid friendly too - very williamsburg ! 
come for the burger , stay for the beer and the patio if you ' re lucky enough to find it open . i ' ve never been disappointed with a burger from the royale , no matter how many times i order the same thing or experiment with new toppings . one of the better burgers in a city littered with good ones and that ' s really saying something . i see a lot of people poo-pooing them but don ' t walk in here expecting something outrageous . it ' s just a good solid beer bar burger and believe me , you ' ll want to come back and try the burger another way once you ' re done with your first visit . good spot for groups , nothing remarkable in terms of beer or liquor ( yes , they have porkslap . so do a million other bars . ) anyway , i like eating here but not hanging around for too long . 
great food , great ambience . love the eden ice cider - amazing dessert wine ! 
forgettable to say the least . start with the staff . i don ' t find it cute or amusing that they are so damn rude and wear it like a badge of honor . customers pay the bills at this joint last time i checked , quit treating them like Nnd class citizens . next , cash only . it ' s N and cash is dying off a little more every day , so it seems weird not to take cards at all . next , value . generally when a place doesn ' t take cards , it ' s because they are making an effort to keep prices down by not having to pay merchant fees on credit cards and machines . but this place charges N . N for a sandwich , N . N for a tiny soda and N . N for fries , not exactly a value . lastly , the food . simply bland . the meat is scarce and lacks seasoning . the cheese is scarce and not enough to moisten the meat . the onions are bulky and not easy to eat . overall , i have to say that all the hype surrounding this place is just that , hype . it ' s not justified in the least and it ' s not worth your time . try elsewhere . 
i have been patiently waiting with anticipation to sample the sandwiches here . with all the yelp love , my expectations were high . i ' m happy to report that i was not disappointed . i sampled the N , bbq pork w a side of fries . though the bbq pork was not what i was expecting , both were still delicious . because i was having a late lunch , i experienced no lengthy lines or seating problems . i do suspect on the wknds or normal lunch hours may not be so seamless . i will definitely be back to try more sandwiches and some of the teas . 
where do i begin . the food is excellent . even when you order delivery . they are incredibly fast and never mess up an order ! the staff is so friendly if you eat in the restaurant . it ' s byob , which is a plus . my personal recommendation the sliced steak plate . melts in your mouth and the ginger chimichurri sauce is outrageous ! ! ! 
ramen was cooked perfectly . the soup was very good as well . the price for the bowl of noodles was like N dollars . N pork buns were N dollars . the sauce for the pork buns was like a mix of hoisin sauce and the special sauce found in a big mac . it works though . the atmosphere is very lively but not overly crowded . i came with a friend and nine and waited for ten minutes before getting bar seating . when we left at around N , the place was packed with people waiting in line for a table ! i would highly recommend this place
excellent excellent malaysian food . . . probably the best malaysian food i ' ve ever had in nyc . blows penang out the water . their family style dishes are slamming , the fried fish , anything with shrimp paste , their chicken rice . . . everything . and the scary thing is . . . it is insane cheap and affordable . a definitely worthy eat . 
interesting atmosphere . good for spicy food ! 
date night for us . this is our place to enjoy ourselves - we don ' t get out too much but when we do we always go here . the food is extremely reasonable and you get a ton enough to take home for another meal not the chain restaurant food . . it is clean and the people that work there actually care . the service has always been friendly and fast if you want it to be fast or slow . we sometimes stay for two or three hours . we like it . 
verlaine rocks . what makes this bar different from the all the other joints in the les is the vibe , the music , and the bartenders ! it ' s like cheers ( remember ? ) . hats off to keith and oscar ! 
the new york food scene has always been a little bit about pilgrimage and vision . and while glasserie might be somewhat off the beaten path it ' s worth the trip to this emerging brooklyn neighborhood . reminder , it was not so long ago that dumbo and williamsburg were considered out of the way . now on to glasserie . . . . flew in from la and went for dinner on a friday night . the place was packed , the atmosphere a lovely blend of candle lit chic industrial , the soundtrack wonderful hip and moody . the service was good , servers and bussers mostly attentive . the food was delicious ! cocktails even better . i prefer small plates intended to be shared it ' s the best way to taste the range of the menu . definitely order the flat bread , labneh , tahini , and the cauliflower dishes . i ' m not a lover of lamb but the lamb croquettes are a must have . all in all love this place . 
this is my cheers bar ! i absolutely love everything about this place . the food is delicious , which is why i always have a hard time deciding what to order . my go to food is hand-battered chicken tenders , the abbaye salad with chicken , or their delicious nachos ! they always have good drink specials and the staff here really takes care of you . great owners ! i know i can go any day or night and have the same wonderful service each time . my favorite day to visit though , is sunday . . . . . . . when they have a decent karaoke crowd . they make karaoke fun . also , bartender amy , you rock my socks girl ! 
a truly excellent coffee shop in astoria ! it ' s nice to finally have a non-starbucks option here . the coffee is really amazing and so is the food . the atmosphere is laid back and has plenty of character . there is also wifi and outlets to plug in your laptop . astoria residents are lucky to finally get such a cool coffee house ! 
outstanding ! ! visited for the first time with my family and what a great experience . the balsamic calamari with hot peppers was out of this world . i wasn ' t expecting the crab cakes to be anything special but they were extraordinary . the meals to include the pizzas and calzones were delicious . i watched the cooks working hard and could tell they cared and had a sense of pride in their work . the service was outstanding and the owner was constantly checking to see if each and every table needed anything . the final test . . . as silly as it may sound , the bathroom was maintained spotless . i can ' t wait to go back , but may visit the sister restaurant in denville . thank you for a great evening of food and ambience with my family ! on a scale of N-N , this restaurant and the food is a N ! 
authentic as it comes . designed for the desi palate ! ask them to spice it up ! the flavors are delicate and has a home made touch to it . the lamb saag is a must . so is the kadhi ! the shahi paneer is brilliant . the aloo gobi is spicy and delicious . the best gulab jamun that i have eaten in a long time . none of the top layer coming of separate like most gits made fakes . you must try the rasmalai - top draw ! you cannot go wrong with this place . 
i had the most amazing dinner at lic market last week . the combination of the foie gras terrine plate with the egg , maple glazed applewood smoked bacon , roasted shallot vinaigrette was much better than foie gras in paris . the imaginative combination blended perfectly in taste and literally melted in your mouth . the endive salad was incredibly fresh was loved by everyone . i got the buttered sea scallops as an entree . they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light but had so much flavor that i wanted to lick the plate . my friends ordered the pan roasted lamb with olive tapenade , basil sauce over pureed turnips and the brisket sliders . i ' m usually not a huge fan of lamb but this changed my mind . this would be one of the few places i would order lamb . we also shared the oyster mushroom hash as a side . the potatoes were so light and unbelievably crisp-the drizzle of truffle oil was the icing on the cake . for dessert , we had the warm apple crisp and the roasted pecan caramel flan . it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal-not too sweet and light , leaving us without the heavy weight of guilt after imbibing on dessert . needless to say , i will be going back often . i have come to the realization that little gems like lic market far surpass the trendy renown big names when it comes to taste , service and the quality of food . there are many times i ' ve emerged disappointed in one or two , if not all of the food but i was truly amazed by every bite . it will be my regular place . 
i love this place ! ! ! ! the mexican style grilled corn on the cob with a michelada to drink is pretty much the best thing ever . the servers are sassy and funny and take good care of you . 
the sushi here was as good as it gets and the staff is friendly and accommodating . i would highly recommend this place for your sushi needs . and , yes , the byob policy is the greatest . a nice bottle of saki was purchased right next door for N . N . go check it out . 
i kept hearing almost weekly from my bf ' s bro about how great this place is and after reading a review of sketch on a hamburger today ( aht . seriouseats . com arch ) i finally made it in for an early dinner . i was really surprised when we walked in . . . not at all what i expected it to look like ! it ' s a little dive-y but cozy , also we were the only people in there which surprised me . we sat down and our waitress came over and told us to check out the specials and the menu . my boyfriend and i both decided to go all out with the kobe burger , hey why not ? i got mine with horseradish cheddar and my bf got his with bacon and american . we also got a large order of fries ( make sure you get the aioli dipping sauce , it ' s free ) . no fountain soda here-- just a very random selection of small bottles in a fridge . so we grab N and sit down . our fries come out in about N minutes and they were excellent thick cut , crispy sort of belgian style , with lots of flavor . i would kill for the recipe for the aioli dipping sauce - i couldn ' t get enough . we couldn ' t stop eating them and i was worried i wouldn ' t be able to even touch my burger . soon after our burgers came out . . . my burger was cooked perfectly medium and very juicy , however there was soo much juice i had a bloody pool in the bottom of my container so the bottom bun was totally saturated and was a mushy mess but what can ya do ? either way , it was a good burger , but it wasn ' t what i expected for the kobe beef patty . my bf and i agreed it tasted like any other beef burger i ' ve had in a decent restaurant . i only have one complaint and that was the price . . . our total came out to N without tip for N burgers , N order of fries , N sodas . the kobe burger is N . N ( yikes ! ) and that is just the burger with lettuce and tomato . . . if you want cheese add N and any other toppings add another N for each . i would definitely get the regular sirloin ( N . N ) next time . . . no need to upgrade to the kobe . a side note . . . later on i was looking at the postcard menu i took with me and noticed it said american kobe . . . so it ' s not the real kobe beef i originally thought i was getting . not that it ' s a huge issue or that i ' m an expert on the topic , but should that still carry the high price and the name ? i think american wagyu is the correct term , but now i ' m just being a huge food snob . ) 
husband and i had dinner N N N at Npm when the " shark bar " section of restaurant opened . we were greeted and seated promptly . noticed nice and comfortable decor . server appeared quickly to start our order . the service was very , very good . server was pleasant , friendly and checked back just the right amount times . the food was a great disappointment . the clam chowder was good with a smoky flavor , not a lot of clams and other items and we were served hot rolls right from the oven . i had some sweet potato fries ( which i had not tried before ) and they were alright up to the point i was picking a hair off of them just as the server was checking back . she was far more upset about it then i . she offered to bring me another fresh serving but i declined as i found them not that tasty . she ended up taking them off the bill . my husband and i had a chuckle because she was so upset about the hair and we took it in stride as that type of thing happens and i wasn ' t going to let it spoil our dinner . however , it went downhill quickly when we got to the entrees . i ordered the shrimp and scallop pot pie . i asked for a description of it beforehand and was told it was a pot pie with the seafood in a white cream sauce . when i asked about vegetables , the server did tell me there were some peas in it . it looked good when it arrived steaming hot . however , it was very , very bad . the nicely browned crust tasted like the preparer had accidentally dropped a handful of salt on it . the cream sauce was on the thin side and absolutely bland beyond description . even after i added salt , pepper and lemon to it - it was still very bland . there were about N tiny shrimp and N button sized tiny scallops and the rest of the pot pie was brimming with ( frozen ) carrots , large chunks of onion , celery , and peas . with all the vegetables the sauce still was tasteless . the tiny shrimp were alright and the tiny scallops were sweet and very tender . my husband had the crab cake with a side of cole slaw . he said the crab cake was very unremarkable and the cole slaw so bad he only ate N bites . i think the server sensed we had not enjoyed our meal when she picked up our still full plates . she did not question us and i was actually glad because after the hair in the fries , i just did not want to go into our disappointment with the meal - figured we would just press on . we both had creme brulee for dessert and it was very good . a couple of cokes , soup , fries , N entrees and N desserts brought the bill to N . we left the server a N tip because of her excellent service and not pushing the issue when she probably sensed we did not enjoy the meal . we really just wanted to go and put this bad dining experience behind us ! ! ! we will not go back . hope future diners fare better . 
it ' s nice place to dine in and take out , they also do delivery and catering . you might think they are just another chinese restaurant in the area . taste and quality are their main purpose , definitely make you guys surprise , just go and try yourself ! trust me you desire the best ! 
i have been here on several occasions , on different days and times , and each has been a satisfying experience . i ' ve been at the ever-popular fireplace , at a standard N top inside , and outside as well . there is something to be said for some quality brunch , sipping a choice from their diverse beer selection , and pleasant service . most recently , i came here on a date . alice was our server , and she was fantastic . my date and i both have experience in the restaurant industry , and alice was the perfect server . we were here for a tuesday brunch , and if it were busy we would have happily moved on and opened the table . it was not , so we out-stayed most other guests and worked through the beer list - thanking alice with a well-deserved gratuity for enhancing out experience . we appreciated ( and followed ) her recommendations from the beer list once she learned our tastes and preferences . 
i don ' t get it . this place came highly recommended but i didn ' t see anything special about the steak as opposed to steaks i ' ve gotten elsewhere . their grape juice concoction is unimaginative . their steak was mediocre . meh . 
highly recommend the weekend brunch . looking forward to go back for dinner soon . 
the worst cheese steak i ever had . period ! end of conversation . 
i ' ve been here a bunch of times and it has definitely lived up to the hype . nearly every item on the menu has an ingredient i ' ve never heard of before but that ' s not a problem because everything always tastes amazing . i really like the pizzas . the decor of this place is pretty unusual but that adds to the character . 
the pizza here is fantastic ! my favorite pizza by far . the paradiso with sundried tomatoes and shrimp is excellent . all the other food is great as well . good prices plus it is byo which is great . 
gave the place another try but seriously the staff has the personality of their fried pickles which suck btw , not once have i gotten a welcome back or a buy back . . . . . . this place is a haven for poser hipsters who moved to astoria from like ohio or some shit . . . . do us all a favor , shave your mustaches and beards and move to williamsburg . 
apr N , N went to diner last night with N other people . portions very small with a limited pricy menu . all entrees were warm , not hot when we were served . we are frequent restaurant goers in the city . service was fine . the restaurant was cold , we asked several times can the heat be turned up . when it came time to pay the check we gave the waiter our N little fish gift card which was rejected . the waitier the owner refused the card saying this is a new owner they cannot honor the gift card . the owner said he did not get the money when the card was purchased therefore the card could not be used by us . . we talked argued with the owner but to no avail . we were disappointed in the entire evening will not return to the restaurant . 
just returned from the contav so disappointed . . . . it has really gone down hill . food was just ok . but what was worse sitting in the bar , i ordered a drink from the specials menu , it was maple manhattan they were out of maple bourbon so she substituted fireball . . just awful so she offered to make another i ordered a regular manhattan she served it in a shot glass and charged me N . like to stay local but will not be going back anytime soon ! 
i have had dinner at the manor many times and have found the food delicious . however , last evening ( N-N-N ) i was very disappointed with the food . the apps were good , but the main course was not up to the standard set by this restaurant . i ordered prime rib , but received what seemed to be a rib steak with bone . my friend ordered baked cod , and the fish had many bones and all they gave along with the fish was a large portion of raw onions and canned white potatoes . it was not good . the vegetables they served were undercooked and the rice was not good . the sauce with the appetizer ( fried squid ) was obviously out of jar for it tasted like franchesco rinaldi sauce . the worst part of the evening was the sangria . it was lacking in flavor other than wine , and it needed some orange juice and soda . we asked for this and they gave us a glass with both orange juice and soda . it appeared on the bill as a charge and that was it for me . i have been a loyal customer for a long time at this establishment , but you could see that they have cut the quality of the food due to the lack of business , and i will never come back again . three tables were being used , that is all for the dinner hour , so something is wrong to have so few people for dinner . 
had an extraordinary dining experience here yesterday , celebrating my daughter ' s graduation . showed up ( unintentionally ) without a reservation , and they welcomed us in immediately , setting up an extra table since they had two very large parties . service was very friendly and exceptionally attentive without hovering . the food was very good , but it was the service and the genuine caring that impressed us . my wife ' s seared tuna was a little overdone , and they insisted on cooking it over ( and it was perfect ! ) . they even went so far as to prepare a special dessert for my daughter ( for her accomplishment ) and my wife ( for her inconvenience ) . it ' s not often that a restaurant moves me , but this one showed such attentive care for people that i love that it was very , very meaningful to me . we don ' t love in the area , but would travel to hartford to visit this restaurant . 
my brooklyn friends rave about this place and we finally got to go without a huge wait . their lunch specials are good- ranging from N- N or so . we started out with guacamole that was top of the line . it came with crispy tortillas instead of chips- different and i like it . normally , i ' m not a big quesadilla fan . if i want that , i ' ll make a grilled cheese . but , the flor de calabaza quesadilla came highly recommended from good sources so i gave it a shot . so good . best quesadilla i ' ve ever had , hands down . stop trying everyone else ! if i were to go back , i ' d order like N of these . also ordered a fish taco which was really subpar compared to guac and quesadilla . the restaurant is tiny ( my philadelphia coming out ) but it ' s adorable on the inside . price was right , great service , excellent food . def a N star experience . 
i think this is the best place in hamilton . i go there at least twice a week the food is excellent ! the owners and the staff are very professional . they treat you like family when you go there they know you by name your not just another customer . i have never had a bad meal here at tessara ' s . they have a big menu lots of things to choose from . steak , veal chicken , fish and pasta dishes . another plus for tessara ' s is the prices are affordable and you get big portions . they also have a nice cozy . they have the best sangria in town . i have had parties there for friends of mine they loved it all the waiters were all very attentative . you got to try this place you won " t regret it trully ! ! ! ! 
so tonight we decided to give the place a second chance . we live in the neighborhood and were coming home from a movie . the place we though would have a lively " bar " or " nightcap " scene . we entered the door and walked up to the bar to be greeted by an awestruck bartender with a hipster mustache who had to ask the hostess if the restaurant was still open or not . clearly it must not have been as two tables were sat , and N other people were having drinks at the bar . it must have been closed . so the two of us as well as the three behind us left in a embarassed fury and happened to walk right past the owner . maybe hipsters should stick to emo and music and stop opening restaurants . who trains these people . terrible terrible terrible . we are going to give it one more shot , after all , they did just opened . . . . and it is greenpoint . 
the sandwich was good but nothing to rave about . i was not a fan of the bread . too tough for me but i could tell it was fresh . when it ' s hard to bite through you just make a mess . and what sandwich place in philly doesn ' t have a cheesesteak on the menu ? 
everything about this restaurant was superb--decor , ambiance , service , and food ! the sushi was very fresh and beautifully prepared . there were other items on the menu , but we stuck with appetizers and sushi dishes . byob , but they do sell some local ( nj ) wines as well . we will defnitely be back ! 
professional yet warm service . loved the simple but elegant interior , despite nyt ' s criticism that the design fell flat . delicious pasta and underrated desserts . prix fixe menu seems like an excellent option for a nice night out . congrats to the culinary team - well done . 
we had a spring dinner meeting for a group of N - no extra charge for the private room - excellent service and great foodl a committee choice but it worked out very well - some had never had greek food ! started with tzatziki , spanakopitta , grilled vegetables , chicken souvlake - rice , and mousaka and gyro platter - all delicious and served family style - seconds easy to get and enjoy delivered at a slow pace . we had brought our own birthday cake - ( celebrating queen elizabeth and william shakespeare ' birthday . this is a sister city group called friends of barnet - we will go again - and probably increase the attendance when others find out how great the food was . i see we were there when some of the exchange members were here -still good ! 
worst indian food and worst service in us . while ordering drinks we were told that they do not have new menus and so we had to order based on our understanding ( without drinks menu ) . when ordering appetizers we were told that the vegetable bhajiya were N days old so we should go for onion bhajiya which were made today morning ( we were not sure how bhajiya can be made earlier and how could the waiter tell this to the customers ) . the starters as expected after this were one of the worst . then we ordered some curry and rotis . it took almost an hour to get the food . if we were not hungry we would have just left the place . will never eat at the place again . the food was too costly . also the bill had some additional items added . the cashier also did not give full discount on the groupon . had to discuss multiple times to get each of the things corrected . worst service and food ever in my life . please save yourselves of the humility at this restaurant . about N per person for such food ! ! ! 
we arrived early and the beautiful background was red and by the time we left it changed to a yellowish green . the atmosphere was relaxing and beatifully done . we loved the background music of soft rock and movie trivia in the bathrooms . our waitress was extremely attentive to our every course . we enjoyed all of the small dishes but would highly recommend the edamame dumplings , lobster roll , crab on rice cracker and ice cream cones for dessert . definitely go here with someone who enjoys sharing ! ! you will have a great time at this cozy , well priced , fantastic establishment . i highly recommend for N or for a group ! 
nice place for lunch
whiskey is my drink of choice , and as you could guess village whiskey has them all . great atmosphere to go relax , sip a fine whiskey or scotch , and talk with the local crew . the burgers get all the attention they deserve , and yes , they are on the pricey side , but you knew that before you walked in . it ' s garces , you pay , he delivers . -john wiederman
rays is the good ole reliable . massive pies . . . the best all-around pizza in the area and i make it a point to go to all pizzerias . 
this place is not pretentious by any means - it ' s a great place to go on a weeknight when you just want some quick , well-priced , satisfying food . the service is friendly and like i said , prompt . the prices are amazing , especially considering you get a huge amount of food ( the pad thai was enough to feed two ) . i ordered the vegetarian pad thai and it was delicious with lots of good tofu in it . my friends really liked their dishes as well . i would definitely recommend this place ! they also have a full bar , which is always a plus . 
i ' m obsessed with their saigon pho , chicken bahn mi and spring rolls . i also frequently get their crab meat specials if they have them . the bahn mi is a perfect balance of sweet and salty . they use quality bread and the texture of the cold veggies and hot chicken is nice . the pho broth is soothing and they use fresh ingredients . it ' s a great place for a speedy delicious meal . they are often busy and will take your order before you sit so don ' t be discouraged if there is a wait it is rarely longer than N minutes . super friendly staff who do their job of suggesting food and serving well . 
went to almond for brunch today and had a lovely , low fuss meal . we walked straight up around the time it opened ( Nam ) and got a table for N outside . it was a beautiful morning and so we were very happy . it ' s really nice to have a good brunch without the anxiety of knowing when or whether you ' ll get a table . we were probably lucky with the outdoor tables ( there ' s probably N or so outdoor tables ) but almond has quite a large capacity inside so i would expect that getting a table fairly quickly would be the norm if you ' re not fussed as to whether you ' re indoors or outdoors . i had the croque monsieur with tomato which was yummy and just so huge - you could definitely share it between N i think . my husband had the omelette and was happy with his also . the best bit about the whole experience was the complimentary scones ( perfectly baked ) and accompaniments - yumbo ! service was also efficient so no complaints there . we will return . 
all i can say is try the dan dan noodles ! i promise you will be dreaming about them . as for the other food the spice can at times overwhelm the flavor but there are several dishes worth indulging in , including the triple flash fried fish , the cumin style chicken and their crispy rice style anything . the service is sometimes flaky but i attribute that to the small staff being unable at times to accommodate the bursts of business , but its obvious that they try their best . however , on the good days it is apparent that the staff actually eats the food there and always makes great recommendations to new comers . be prepared to take a doggie bag home , their portions are hefty . the last time i was there it was byob , however i am pretty sure i saw an application to serve alcohol so maybe they are currently serving drinks as well . 
had the soft taco with mexican sausage a mexican corn on cob and a shrimp burrito and a coke . it was good clean place and price was good to have to try more dishes
best ramen place we have found in manhattan thus far . granted , we haven ' t been to them all ( maybe in a year or so ) , but as my boyfriend put it , the chicken paitan ramen is like a hug from the inside . 
great tapas food . amazing . 
le bus is a good spot to pick up a sandwich or bread . they sell good challah and multigrain bread , although there is a wheat bread they sell that i do not like as much . overall , though , their bread is better than metropolitan bakery . the dehli and lebanon sandwiches are great . however , they generally do not press the sandwiches for long enough , so they are often lukewarm . i like that they have a bread card and a sandwich card--a free loaf sandwich for each N purchased . their cookies are very greasy , and too sweet . their muffins are tasty , however . 
i love fung chinese restaurant ! i heard from a friend that i had to try it , and it is the only chinese food place that i want to go back again in hartfrod area . this restaurant is very clean ( they got " a " for the sanitary inspection grade which make me feel safe to order from them . ! and i love their chicken and broccoli , sesame chicken and general tso ' sthe only reason i ' m not giving them N stars is because they need a better phone system . sometime i have to call about N times during the friday and saturday night before i get through on a busy night yet i still call and call , because i think they are the best ! ) . and sometime their french fries have gotten a little greasier over time- which bums me out because i don ' t like greassy food . 
great experience . delicious food by all accounts . right on the park , so location is as nice as it can get in phl . 
calzone and pizzas were amazing ! being told we ' d have to wait N hours to be seated not ok . of the N times i ' ve attempted to eat here , i ' ve only waited it out and actually ate here once . the service left much to be desired , our waiter seemed annoyed with us and his job and his stalled acting career , but his clothing and hair were immaculate ! i get very annoyed when i read reviews where peoples ' main gripes are about the clientele of an establishment . it ' s kinda like someone going to a jerk chicken place in east new york and then writing on yelp they didn ' t enjoy their meal because they don ' t like black people . also amusing is how many people write " but i ' m no hipster " yet their photo says quite the contrary ! hahahahaha
we stopped at isabella ' s on N N N because it looked quaint and had outdoor seating . the restaurant was quite busy on this hot , saturday afternoon . my first impression was that of a busy , nyc cafe . nothing special and nothing bad . while waiting for seating i visited the restroom . dirty and cramped is the best way to describe it . xcelerator hand dryer located over the toilet ? ? ? toilet paper on the floor flying all over the bathroom while i ' m drying my hands ( over the toilet ) . gross . once seated outside , our waitress was friendly but we had to wait a bit for pretty much everything , including a straw . i ordered the chopped salad ( think greek salad ) with shell steak . i was very disappointed . the salad had no reall taste and the steak was very fatty . at N extra for the steak , i was disappointed . N N of the steak was not edible . my daughter had ( runny ) scrambled eggs since this was still considered brunch . the lemon fries was good . my friend had the grilled chicken skewer salad and said it was tasty . my bloody mary was nothing special , and the more i drank it the more i was questioning the chunks of horseradish that i was swallowing since my experience at isabella ' s left me questioning the cleanliness of the restaurant . our bill came to N for N people including the bloody mary and a belini . i will never come back here again and i do not recommend this restaurant , especially when there are thousands of others to choose from . 
you go right ahead and have your philly cheesesteak while i stand and watch tommy " dinic " , ( tommy nicolosi ) himself , pull a pork shoulder out of a slow cooking oven , lay the pork on a board and start pulling it apart , enough to fill a twelve inch provolone lined roll , stuff it more than he needs to and then ladle pork juice with cracklings and red wine in the drippings laced with onions , all over the top . that may have been the longest sentence in yelp history , but i needed to take you there . circling the terminal , deciding what i wanted to share with five others , as our grand finale , belly stuffing , need to try it all feast , i kept returning to watch the magic that dinic ' s conjures up . when i came by for my final stare , he knew my face well . i asked him if he served the pulled pork with a barbecue sauce and he grimaced an emphatic no . okay then i will have the pulled pork with provolone , onions and roasted red peppers on the side . his team mate quickly pulled a pork shoulder out of the oven and went to work at building my sub as i marveled at all the awards he has won . in the meantime , he pulled a beef brisket out of the oven and took a quick slice of it and said it ' s perfect , then turned to me and said , " the window for timing this roast is very narrow and it is crucial to do it just right . " he then sliced a nice sized piece for me , even though others were standing around , watching and drooling all over their t-shirts and sneakers . laying the brisket on three napkins deep and sucking up all of those wonderful juices , i quickly pulled it off the napkin and bounced it into my mouth . it was like butter , so tender and juicy , it melted in my mouth as well as a good filet mignon would . regretting ordering the pulled pork at that moment was quickly redeemed when we got to our final resting spot and i took one bite of the pulled pork sandwich . heaven on a bun and why i question the almighty cheesesteak as being the iconic sandwich of philadelphia . dinic ' s roasts their meat for eight hours , in a slow oven , constantly basting it . they also serve thinly sliced roast pork , chicken , veal and sausage sandwiches . all toppings are an additional seventy five cents , which is a steal for a foot long top quality meat sandwich . my total came to eight dollars and it was worth twice that . next time i will stuff my face with the ultra tender beef brisket that has slowly marinated in beef broth , thyme , onions , garlic , red wine and tomato sauce . whatever you get , grab extra napkins , including one to use as a bib and plan to pig out on one of the best sandwiches you will ever wrap your mouth around . 
love this place ! food is spectacular and the waiters are so helpful and friendly ! brunch is especially enjoyable . i can ' t get enough of this place . 
my fianc and i had horrible experience there . we have been customers for over N years usually sticking to their pizza and calzones which we have always loved . however our last visit there , which will be our last , was like a dining experience neither of us had experienced before . we have both worked in the restaurant business is the past and have never encountered a situation like this . my plate , the chicken rivera , was absolutely horrible . it tasted like they spread honey dijon mustard right out of the bottle onto chicken and noodles . neither my boyfriend ( who eats just about anything ) or i could manage to get down more then one bite . when our waitress finally came to our table to see how we liked our food , i explained to her that it was not at all what i expected and that it was so appalling they i could not eat it . she wanted to charge me for a replacement bowl of pasta and marinara and didn ' t bother taking any percentage of the meal off even after i had barely touched it . she rudely explained that this is how they had always made it and since it was edible ( it wasn ' t ) there was nothing she could do . although the owner sat at the bar the entire time and could of cared less about customer service or repeat customers . needless to say we won ' t ever be returning there again and unless you like being ripped off i wouldn ' t recommend it to anyone . also , for being newly renovated , the place was absolutely filthy . 
over a decade ago- before yelp , before camera phones , before google maps , and before i became a food snob , my friend and i stumbled on this little creperie on our way to south street . and just like that , we discovered our favorite restaurant for the next N years . the crepes are in a league of their own- soft , buttery , and perfectly filled each time . the only problem is trying to figure out what to put in it ! if this is your first time visiting , i ' d recommend trying one of their house specialties , or pick one of my favorite combos below ( carefully curated after years of research ! ) savory -mushrooms mushroom sauce -sausage , ratatouille , tomato sauce -beef bourguignon sweet -lemon curd white chocolate -nutella vanilla ice cream ( simple and perfect ) -banana , white chocolate , caramel , vanilla ice cream in my opinion , a truly fantastic restaurant stands the test of time . i ' ve been back a few times since leaving philly , and beau monde ' s crepes are still the best i ' ve ever had . 
i wanted to try it after reading the reviews here . it really is the best pizza i had . i got the personal size veggie think crust well done . it was great . 
we just had lunch here and it was great ! really good beer , salads , and fantastic pizza . waitstaff was very friendly and nice space . highly recommended ! 
i went there many times and im disappointed at seeing the same waiter that is attending my table is also cleaning toilets and vacuuming . this is pretty gross and unsanitary . on top of that , there seams to be no order nor organization . the workers are all over the place multitasking . this shows a lack of management . the food is great i must say and i would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for authentic brazilian cuisine . i would have given this place a N , but as a very observant person , i was not happy at seeing how disorganized the workers were . 
this is the best place for cuban food . i usually try to get there before twelve to get a table . the place is very small and very uncomfortable but the food is fantastic . everything i have is delicious including the cuban sandwich , chicken diablo sandwich , fish taco and the corn . 
have gone here several times before phillies games ! love the homey atmosphere it has ! great bartenders and servers you ' ll ever get ! and also pretty good food for being just a local bar . i recommend the panzertinis ! 
terrific service . manager is very professional and courteous . had nachos , burger and chicken breast . prices were reasonable given the location and decor of restaurant . food was very delicious . drinks were terrific specifically the frozen sangria . gorgeous restaurant . would highly recommend for groups , birthdays and definitely for a simple night out . reservations on the weekend would be good but i don ' t mind lounging by the water and or water ( N-Nmin wait ) 
how many ways can i saw awesome ? ? beet salad - awesome . whipped ricotta - awesome . brussel sprouts - awesome . old fashioned ( cocktail ) - awesome . staff - awesome . ok , so i thought the salted caramel dessert was only very good . if you can ' t get a reservation , sit at the bar . you can watch everything being made and chat with the staff . 
the boyf and i went here for university city ' s dining days tonight ( N person for an appetizer , entree , and a dessert ? ! stfu ! ) . i ' d been before , but my first experience was kinda . . . ok ? but i like second chances . and i freaking love cilantro . so , vietnam cafe was our choice for dinner ! a few days ago , i left a question on vietnam cafe ' s facebook wall asking if any desserts were vegan ( i ' m one of those people ) , and i was informed that they all contain dairy . oh well . no dessert for me , but i could at least still have a cheap dinner ! upon arriving , our waiter informed me that the N pudding desserts were , in fact , vegan . i took the risk ! but first , let ' s start with appetizers . i got the fried tofu ( ask for vegan dipping sauce ! ) , and it was pretty good . i mean , the tofu was fried perfectly and the sauce was great , but the tofu tasted like . . . just that . tofu . for my entree , i got the vermicilli rice noodle dish topped with fried spring rolls and crushed peanuts . it was a lot of food . the spring rolls were pretty good . . . but still , some flavour was missing . some umph ! some salt ! some peppers ! some soy sauce ! something . . . i ' d eat it again , sure . i have the left overs downstairs . it wasn ' t bad , it just wasn ' t awesome . of course , since our waiter told us there are vegan dessert options , i go the taro pudding ( taro rice coconut milk , served hot ) . so simple , so good . soooo good . i didn ' t think the service was slow at all , but we went at a N o ' clock on a sunday . our waiter was super nice ! and N bonus points for the prettyfullness of the restaurant . 
food N N everything i ' ve tried tastes great . the goat cheese tart , mussels , and filet mignon are highly recommended . venue N N the place feels a little cramped and the ambient noise is a little too loud for my liking -- i always have trouble hearing my date when we ' re talking . otherwise , it ' s cozy and the darkness enhances the atmosphere . price N N the dishes are expensive but for the quality taste it ' s well worth it . service N N the ladies are always lovely . verdict it ' s definitely one of the best french restaurants in nyc . 
coffee is always fresh and cheap ( N , piping hot ! ) , baked goods are always scrumptious , and their salads sandwiches paninis soups never fail . i come here at least once a week , probably more often for breakfast and or lunch . i have been here on occasion for dinner , and their dinner menu is new , so i can ' t say much for it , as i usually just end up ordering one of their many tasty sandwiches ! their menu changes very frequently ( every season or so ) , and they add take away sandwiches and salads depending on ingredients . things to try ginger scone , coffee , mushroom and stilton cheese panini , turkey club . when in a rush , i grab their turkey club stix from the counter . all their breakfast items are tasty - N for a breakfast croissant sandwich with bacon , eggs , and cheese - yes please ! would choose this over starbucks anyway . also , staff is so friendly ( on occasion , there is a disgruntled server , but hey , c ' est la vie ) , and you can browse the bookstore if you are waiting for takeout . 
nothing new in this review other than what everyone else has been saying . this place is never a hit or miss . it ' s always a hit ! the line could get pretty long ( especially on a weekend late night ) but its definitely worth the wait ! if you don ' t want to wait in line ( especially now with the cold winter coming in ) , you could visit the location early ( Npm ) ! you could mix the meat from chicken and lamb over rice to just chicken or just lamb etc . what a combination ! chicken lamb salad pita with some white red sauce combo . just makes my mouth water just thinking about it . i ' ve heard that the cart across the street ( east side ) is owned by the same owner . i ' m not sure how true this is but i ' ve seen them transfer supplies from one cart to another , use the same bags , and the lines are way shorter ( if there is one ) . i went to both and they seem very similar . if you do not want to wait in the line , you could get the same deal right across the street ! 
disappointing ! nothing healthy on the menu and the food was not very good . very , very slow service . 
in a word , spectacular . my friends took me here for my birthday last week and words cannot express how mouth wateringly ( is that a word ? ) delicious everything was . we went with our very patient waiter ' s advice and did the tasting menu , which were about N entrees and two desserts . there were N of us and it was more than enough to satisfy us . everything from presentation to combination of flavors were amazing and spot on . a couple of dishes we had were scallops risotto , tuna tartare on tempura and short rib sliders . there were all extremely flavorful and just flat out phenomenal - best dining experience i ' ve had in a long time . 
imagine a bbq in your friends backyard . now imagine your friends are are amazing chefs who prepare for you some of the greatest cajun food you ' ve ever had . that ' s tchoup . 
so ghetto , so good . this is an absolutely no frills dumpling and made-on-the-spot , pulled noodles place . not the kind you ' d bring a date to . . not the kind you ' d linger in . the sort of spot where you eat , and go . some of the best fried dumplings in the city . . also available frozen for you to take home and enjoy . i love the pork chop noodles here . . the chops are so freaking greasy , but they are also ridic tasty . dunk it in the beef broth , and see the oil ooze away . fun times . the dry noodles ( ja jiang mian ) is okay - a little too sweet . would probably not get it again . there is a dude standing in the back of the shop making noodles , and it is loud , as everyone else here has described . don ' t come here if you ' re prone to epileptic fits , or easily shocked . p s it ' s spelt lam zhao . . not lan . get it right , people ! 
this place is a diamond in the dirt . the food here was amazing . first thing for me is customer service . the service here is attentive , polite , warming ( like your eating at your best friends kitchen ) . the resturant interior was clean and inviting . diamond ' s is a hidden gem , and a place that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys great italian food . 
cool diner in the presence of great service ! i am giving five stars to top diner due to its high quality diner . this place always good for diner . top diner have a seperate portion for family . the taste of all items also great and fantastic . each and everything fresh , hot and delicious . the menu of the food also extreme . soft and cold drinks also available . but now a days i am facing that they stop a service of wine after a long time . i humble request that play the service of wine again . if we talk about the beauty of the top diner restaurant is super excellent . the walls and tables , chair , and furniture also nice . the atmosphere always cool . no disturbance in any work . the staff also nice , cooperative and friendly . the price of all items are balance and perfect . 
hi . i am tania from prive event planning feel free to text me at N-N-N to get vip admission with me at skyroom nightclub friday night , asia from the pussycat dolls will be performing ! also feel free to store my number and name because i plan some of the best parties in nyc . 
guten tag bierstube ! ! finally a german bar in the city that doesn ' t give off a corporate-gimmicky feel . the beer list is awesome - almost N taps and i ' d guess about N bottles . i had the weihenstephaner dunkel on draft to start ( a beer i find hard to pass up ) and my girl had a franziskaner . we ordered some pretzel bites right away while we decided on the rest of our food . they came out quickly and we had to ask the server for more of the beer cheese mustard sauce because it was so delish . finally , we made up our minds and shared the smoked salmon potato pancake platter as an app . the potato pancakes were golden brown , the salmon was fresh and the apple slaw both lightened up the dish and added a touch of sweetness . score . the hungarian goulash was my choice for an entree - the mixture of beef , veal and pork brought out the inner-carnivore in me . it is served over soft spaetzle that is very complimentary to the bold flavors of the goulash . my girlfriend got the cod entree with the wine-mustard cream sauce . the fish was light , flaky and cooked perfectly and the sauce was outstanding . lots of flavor going on here , we almost asked for a spoon to eat the rest of the sauce ( i ' m not above that ) . her pirrogen side hit the spot too - anything cooked in brown butter is alright with me . since everything was good so far ( and because i said i wasn ' t leaving until i drank an aventinus ) we ordered dessert . how can you pass up an apple strudel ? it was the perfect close to our meal . this is definitely the place to check out if you like german beer and food . it ' s spacious and welcoming inside and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable ( our server was funny too ) . i ' ll be back soon , bierstube . 
i ' m more accustomed to the Nnd street one . but i officially tried here for the first time and was equally impressed . the service is always top notch and they customize your sandwich however you ask . they also get you your sandwich pretty quickly . all of the ingredients are super fresh and ultra tasty too . they have so many wrap selections that your not always going to pick one you like . but for every one that you don ' t your bound to find three that you will . so make a good effort to find what speaks to you when looking at the menu . the wrap shack also offers of smoothies and milk shakes . but i haven ' t always been fond of them and would recommend going for a regular drink instead . the peanut butter chocolate one can be good if your looking for a heavy protein fix though . it ' s cool that you can eat inside this one . but since rittenhouse square is only a block away i prefer sticking with eating my wraps outside , at least for now . 
i went to this place last week . i had my first cheesesteak at tony luke ' s , but didn ' t review because i had no real comparison . anyway , went there on a saturday night at around N ish . waited online for about N minutes and when i finally got to the counter there was an old thuggish man at the cashier who mumbled my order . just to make sure , i repeated myself and he gave me a ridiculous attitude , trying to play me like i was a teenage kid . anyway , i stupidly said i was from ny and he started babbling about the phillies and how the yankees suck . he said , " we ' re gonna get another ring this year . one for each finger . " and he stuck up his middle fingers in my face . is that a joke ? i mean i don ' t expect much class , but i don ' t expect to be given the finger while i ' m trying to order dinner . i ' m there for a sandwich , not to talk about your loser life and how baseball is the high point in your day . i hated the service , it was slow ( er than geno ' s even though the line was twice as long ) and this guy just really irked me . . . i gotta say though , out of geno ' s and pat ' s their steaks are better . more meat , more cheese . it was pretty tasty . not to mention their fries are nice and crispy . 
greek lady is the best ! it ' s the perfect spot to grab a quick dinner with friends , or get food delivered late at night . the food is tasty , convenient , and cheap , and there ' s always so much to choose from . the salads are huge and the mozzarella sticks are the perfect comfort food . i would also recommend anything on their brunch menu . the staff is always super friendly and helpful . even on a busy day , they get your order out as quickly as possible . and from my experience , their delivery is always faster than expected . every time i have ordered greek lady off grubhub , the food has been at my door in under N min ( although it ' s usually closer to N ) . bottom line whenever i need to get great food at a great price with awesome service , i know greek lady is the place to go . 
what a gem of a place . the antipasto was out of this world . la boca is the best dining experience on north ave . 
okay , so for starters let me give you a disclaimer . . . the three stars paired with a glowing culinary review is due to the absolutely awful service . . . and a certain aloofness that undoubtedly comes from the feeling that they ' re better than me . but the burgers . . . oh my god the burgers . they are the reason to keep coming back every single time . an incredible variety of toppings thar are all delicious , but i always come back to the same one . . . medium rare with french brie , pickled jalapenos , and bacon . paired with the fries . . . it ' s just amazing . you have to go . . . and heavily drink so the service doesnt seem so bad . 
such a charming place ! the music is always great and the vibe is romantic , quaint , friendly . its very " brooklyn " with the jmz line going past overhead . food is simple but delicious . the sticky date cake is the best ! i feel like they need to add a cocktail menu . 
i visited sugar freak on a saturday night . only a N-N minute wait at the bar . drinks it was obvious that the guy behind the bar was in training , which can be forgiven since the spot is new . but when my boyfriend ( a bartender himself ) commented about there being tax on drinks , the bartender said , " yeah , its a new law in ny . " ) my bf was polite , smiled and let it go . drinks sucked , watered down kool-aid . i strongly advise not ordering the hurricane or watermelon punch , unless you are not a drinker . we then ordered a mint julep because there ' s nothing but booze in a mint julep . it was so awful , we didn ' t finish one of them between us . food we had a mac cheese to start . eh . just ok . a little dry , definitely not enough cheese . my boyfriend had the blackened catfish , which was good , not great . very small sides . i had the buttermilk fried chicken . this could have been frozen from a box . side was sweet potato fries , undercooked . they should have called this salt freak because the food was so salty i could only eat a small amount . needless to say we passed on dessert . the best thing a bout this whole place was the decor , which was really adorable . . . and our server holly , who was off the hook . we made it a point to tell the manager how great she was . i didn ' t even have the heart to tell her the food sucked because she was so positive and eager to please . which is why i ' m even giving it N stars . we ' ll go back again after it has been open for a while and have a chance to work out the kinks . especially since it ' s one of the few non-greek eateries that has popped up in the hood . 
my friends and i went here for a book group ( meetup ) i belong to , the noise level was nearly deafening . i am not dropping a star simply because it was a friday evening , but i could barely converse with the members of our table . the bento box that i had was excellent , but next time i might scale down my meal as my eyes were bigger than my stomach . i couldn ' t even finish it , or come close . word to the wise if you ' re getting a bento box , do not order a separate appetizer . i forgot about the parade of soup and salad beforehand . their service was good , but slower as we finished which was a bit frustrating for the gals who wanted to split . 
this place is exactly like the run down hole in the walls that you see in china . ghetto as but solid food at a dirt cheap price . the noodles are not the best but this is bang for the buck baby . potstickers are solid too . my favorite part about this place is the frozen dumplings . N for N bucks . once i bought them here i never went back to the supermarket stuff . try it ! 
train your servers to listen to the customer . to hear the words and not make assumptions . servers this should ring true for you especially if someone elses experience with you dictates your income . no you just showing up and looking pretty means nothing without a polite and classy demeanor . i had to basically almost yell at my server after asking her four times for a wet clean rag to be brought to the table i was seated at . well why the wet rag you ask ? its something so out of the ordinary to order you say ? the rag was so i could wipe the sticky residue and mess off the table i was seated at . you could not see it so the oversight was no big deal . however the funny faces coupled with the dumb founded look that i recieved when i asked for a wet rag was too much . ok maybe she wasn ' t used to being asked for that , maybe that was the problem ? well no she was just either rude , incompetent or another proud middle school graduate . if your at work pay atention to what your customer is saying to you . the silly girl kept bringing me wet napkins , and gave off an extremely rude vibe . if your customer has to clean their own table then you probably shouldn ' t feel entitled to give rude looks or make stupid faces . hire people that can listen when you put them in positions where N percent of their job is listening . i have been here N times and it is a mediocre mega bar but this last time will probably be the last visit . 
have passed this place N , N x and never went in . always very busy parking lot though . so , while driving in a terrible rain storm figured " let ' s get off rt N and in for a bite " pleasantly surprised ! veal meatballs were damn good ! i was very skeptical about ordering meatballs at a " chain type place " but the waiter jason talked us into them . service was on point and personable too . my wife had salad that was solid by her picky standards and my daughter had the homemade spinach ravioli . i thought the prices were very reasonable ( except N for kids cranberry juice ) but not earth shattering . needleless to say we have been back Nx ' s more ( not in a thunderstorm ) so we were able to enjoy the great patio . it ' s not batali type italian but solid for that area of nj . it ' s worth a visit
delorenzo ' s has great tomato pie , some of the best in the trenton metro area . they also have great salads . the service on the other hand is a different story . i frequent delorenzo ' s a lot and the service is poor and factory like . waiters can be arrogant and so is the host . but if you are looking for great pie this is one place in which you will want to stop . 
i was really excited when i read about root bone being the hottest fried chicken place to open up in new york . i realize that fried chicken has been such a divisive food , but fried chicken should unite us . . . . not tear us apart . . . my guest and i waited for about N minutes on a tuesday night which is not bad at all considering many patrons have complained about the wait . the chicken did live up to expectations , it was crisp , moist , and packed full of flavor . i was a bit indifferent about the sides it came with though . it ' s certainly quite an addition to the les though so i cannot complain about that . 
neighborhood gem . awesome panninis and flavor combination . great for a casual , and very tasty meal . very reasonable price for the level of quality . friendly staff . did i mention good food ? 
pros none cons horrible food and service . i don ' t understand all these postive reviews ! my girlfriend and i made reservation at Npm and we started eating at N ! service was very slow but that wasn ' t the worst part . this was by far the worst sushi i have ever had and i couldn ' t believe how busy it was . i ordered many rolls and none of the flavors came together . it was very dry and the fish was chewy . if you gave this place more than N star then you must have never tasted decent sushi in your life ! ! ! do yourself a favor and stay away from this place ! 
uhhhh , this place is freaking spectacular . get the cuban sandwich , you ' ll be very , very happy . the place can be tough to get to and is very tiny inside . it was kind of a battle standing by the counter , letting people by while waiting for our order . but damn , was it worth it . they also have free delivery , ( N minimum ) cuban sandwich was something like N . N . again , very little seating inside but walk over to bryant park and dig in . 
the food is awesome . lunch menu is super cheap and fulfilling . just one thing , it gets extremely busy during lunch time so come early or order ahead . best alternative ( not replacement ) for Nrd Nth nyc . . . 
i have been a balthazar customer for many , many years and keep going back for more . go on a thursday - saturday night and experience one of the best vibes in nyc . beautiful room , fantastic food ( try the filet ) . after dinner , you will find yourself in a great area with tons of bars and other options for fun . on the flip side , my wife says it ' s a tourist trap and prefers union square cafe ( although completely different ) for good food , ambience and location . 
went here with a few girlfriends , and was pleasantly surprised by their chardonnay and pinot grigio by the glass . it was late and early on in the week , so it was pretty quiet , but i could tell that it probably gets pretty crazy on the weekends . the bartender was polite and nice , though not overly friendly . i was looking for a quick flirtation and a little banter , but i could tell he probably wasn ' t in the mood to entertain . however , he was very easy on the eyes and probably has girls drooling over him all the time . prices were reasonable for midtown , and i ' ll definitely try this place again . 
i ' ve been here twice now , having had such a good experience i came back a second time with a friend . both times i walked in , i was greeted with a warm welcome from the hostess at the front , and we were seated promptly and the service was quick . the food is delicious . it ' s a little pricey but the portions are nice ( seriously , one risotto and i was stuffed ! ) , and the staff is very attentive -- my water glass was always promptly refilled and they ' re always ready to help you out from the table whenever you ' re ready . cannot recommend this place highly enough . 
on the rainiest sunday night of the year we wandered in to the cold welcome of a ma tre d ' who seemed delighted to greet a somewhat soaked , apologetically reservationless young couple with news that their seating options were limited because he expected torrents of diners . diners who would never pour in . we were shown upstairs , through the kitchen , to a table " overlooking the street , " which felt far colder and slightly less attended than a locker for meat . so we opted to dine at the bar tended by christian . with his pacific countenance and combative nature , christian somehow managed to make the bar feel far icier than the meat-locker upstairs . he claimed not to have a favorite cocktail . candid perhaps , but awkwardly inappropriate nonetheless . when queried for suggestions and recommendations , he responded with " facts " about the menu . " people like the short ribs that ' s just a fact . " they were fine . but on the whole the food was unoriginal and uninspired . and after every round of food or drink , christian would update our tab and place it in a shot glass in front of our drinks . he claimed that the ten-month-old practice was necessary in order for the runners to find us at the bar and seemed puzzled at how that such an innovative practice might make diners feel rushed and unwelcome . the staff was surly , which we surely believed to result from maltreatment by management . a portly , bespectacled philip seymour hoffman qua mickey rourke sort arrived behind the bar midway through our meal , pounded pinkish bloody marys and spoke of some impending " first class " trip to vegas he had booked with miles . we debated whether he was an oppressive higher up or an oppressed subordinate as his all-black garb obscured any markings of managerial or proprietary standing . bless his big soul if that vegas trip was but a temporary escape from a really bad sitch . . . . we ended up tipping christian N -- not for his service but to provide a modicum of compensation for his apparent servility . in response , christian nary turned his cheek to say goodbye . . . . but that ' s exactly what we said to alta . 
yes . try it . it ' s really that good and it ' s entertaining to watch this artist , this bright shining light from heaven , make your pie . you need to have a sense of humor about the wait though , otherwise you ' ll ruin the entire experience for yourself . 
this place needs a makeover badly . the waitress couldn ' t be bothered . the food is pricey and the pancakes tasted sour . probably won ' t be going back again
simply . . . yum . 
i into taylor ' s on saturday and was greeted by a friendly face , who turned out to be my waiter . i was quickly taken care of and the service was great . i started off with some fried pickles , which came out great . for my main course i ordered a plate of penne vodka which was amazing it is now my favorite vodka sauce . i will definitely be back next week and probably the week after that . i have already recommended it to my friends . 
delicious food . . . i looove the fish stew . you guys must try it ! the escargo is also extremely good . desserts are fantastic , especially the creme brulee and chocolate bruno . the vibe here is trendy , without making you feel uncomfortable . the staff is very nice , and the waiters are all really good looking . ) 
pouttttiiiiinnnnnne ! seriously , try the poutine , it ' s absolutely amazing . 
when walking in we were greeted very warmly by staff , which in nyc seems to be somewhat rare these days . we ordered empanadas , arepas , and the flautas ( sp ? ) for our apps . all of them hit the mark perfectly . for entrees , we ordered the bandeja paisa . the steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked . it ' s not a dish i would have normally gotten , but each component worked perfectly in tandem with the others , and it turned out to be an amazing dish . the jerk chicken was very flavorful and the chorizo rice that went along with it added a great touch to some of the best jerk chicken i ' ve ever had . the entire staff was friendly , attentive , and very well informed of their menus . everyone at our table was well taken care of , drinks refilled quickly , etc . we didn ' t feel rushed to leave , and we were able to really enjoy ourselves . in the end , what i think we all look for in a restaurant is genuinely pleasant service , a great environment that has a fresh and authentic vibe , and above all , great and fresh food that represents the concept that the restaurant is based on . bogota gets top marks in all these categories . 
one of the best cocktail bars in tribeca . great kale salad , love the chicken wings , cocktails are excellent . some of the portions are a bit small for the price but pretty standard for nyc
had dinner at the bosphorus last night . the service was friendly and the food was very good . we took the recommendations of our waiter as he recommended some traditional specialties as well as some personal favorites and everything was spot on . if you enjoy mediterranean cuisine look no further . 
the best restaurant experience i ' ve ever had . hands down . my mother , sister , and i were in nyc for five days on sort of a culinary adventure ( keens , bar room at the modern , babbo , and wd N as well ) , and gt was almost an afterthought . but we had been to the bar room and emp on our last trip and were blown away by both , so i should have expected gt would do the same . what an understatement . we were late in arriving because i gave the cabbie the wrong address , but when i called in , the hostess was very gracious . " don ' t worry about it , we ' ll see you when you get here . " we were seated promptly when we arrived . mike w . was our waiter , and we just hit it off from the get-go . he was so personable and efficient , we felt right at home . mike brought us an amuse bouche trio to start , and then our appetizers . while the lobster salad and lamb papperdelle were fantastic , the warm maine crab in an egg crepe absolutely stole the show . since we hadn ' t ordered the smoked trout , mike didn ' t want us to miss the experience and brought us each a plate . sooo good . my sister doesn ' t really like fish and she ate every last bit . our entrees were duck breast with duck confit , chicken poussin ( one of the specials of the evening ) , and rack of lamb . everything was amazing . we ate every single item on our plates . i don ' t normally order chicken in restaurants ( you can get chicken anywhere , after all ) , but sis ' poussin was outstanding . really moist and flavorful . even the tomatoes accompanying the dish were awesome . but the best thing on our three plates was the chickpea fries that came with my lamb . oh lord , i could have eaten a whole plate of it . mike said he gets that request a lot . kudos to michael anthony ! our desserts were fabulous , and mike topped off the evening by bringing us after-dessert desserts ! and we were given muffins to take back to the hotel , which we glommed on the next morning for breakfast . an overall wonderful experience , from beginning to end . every dish was stellar and timed perfectly . even the cappuccino floored me . service was prompt , unobtrusive , and friendly . we really loved mike - he had some great recommendations for our trip and treated us like we were old friends . even the manager , jen , stopped by during the dessert course to tell us how much her staff enjoyed serving customers who were so obviously enjoying themselves . i ' d fly back to nyc tomorrow just for another meal at gramercy tavern . we ' ll definitely be back . meyer ' s restaurants are definitely to be experienced . 
i don ' t typically write reviews , but i had such an amazing experience at fogo de chao that i couldn ' t help myself ! from the moment we walked in the door , everything was perfect . we got there early and ordered a round of caipirinhas in the bar , which were dangerously good . they sat us right on time . the waiter carefully explained the concept since none of us had been there before . i didn ' t know what to expect , but it was really a ton of fun ! there were just so many choices . i tried to have a little bit of everything . and the food was so delicious ! i was a little worried because two of my friends are vegetarian , but they couldn ' t stop raving about the salad bar and all of the options . throughout the entire meal , the staff was so attentive and thoughtful . it was like they knew what we needed before we did sometimes ! they even knew that it was my friend ' s birthday and surprised her with a candle on her dessert without anyone in our party having to bring it up ! just so great ! i can ' t stop talking about it . we will definitely be back again ! 
i love the crabmeat dumpling ! but sadly that ' s the only high light . other dishes are just ok . or if you go to joe in Nth ave , try the duck smt in the special menu . it ' s pretty delicious . grab a bubble tea nearby if you have to wait in line . but share it or do not finish it cause you ' ll be too full for the food . oh and im also really impressed by an old waiter ' s table-setup skill in joe chinatown . a must see ! 
boo . sad to read so many bad experiences . fork has been one of my favorite old standbys for a long time . i have had many amazing meals there , and some standardly good . service can be up and down . . . . but . . . . if you are ever interested in using their private room for an event i promise you will not be disappointed . we threw our wedding rehearsal dinner there for N people on N N N . the room was stunning , set with candles and perfect lighting , as well as gorgeous customized menus with our names on them . great , i know it doesn ' t take a rocket scientist to run some menus through the printer with the bride and grooms name on it . the attention to detail did not end there , luckily . we were able to pick a three course menu ( N choices per course ) that reflected our food likings and no one was disappointed . we have some major foodies in the family , along with some truly picky eaters and everyone was pleased . highlights were two first course items N ) duck confit with frisee salad and N ) roasted beet salad with tangerines , avacado and a passion fruit vinagrette and N amazing second course choices N ) a vegetarian clay pot with sobas tofu and veggies N ) the hanger steak with yucca frites and chard , and lastly the salmon with fork kim chee and sushi rice . ellen , the owner accomodated both servere milk allergies and my best friend ' s gluten free diet , all the way down to customizing a dessert for us . she also allowed us to pre select wines for pouring during dinner and did not try to upsell us on anything . she and the servers made us feel like family and seemed genuinely excited about our celebration . all that would be great , but wouldn ' t really matter if the food weren ' t spectacular . it was . our guests are still raving about it . i will continue to celebrate milestones and regular sunday afternoons at fork . 
everything about this place is great , except for the service . i love the bartender , but sometimes he can be in an angry mood , but i ' m sure dealing with idiots all day would put everyone in bad mood . the one hostess is just a straight up bitch , and thinks way too holy of herself . shes just a hostess , she needs to realize that . food is great though , and i still tipped N because you can ' t hate on a server just cause the bartender and hostess are mad at the world . overall , this isn ' t the only bar with dim lighting and Ns metal , so they should stop acting like they are unique and different . 
shame on the jerks at this over-priced wanna-be banh mi shop . why ? because they ' d prefer to kill me or not feed me and my family after we took two trains to try to their sandwiches . you see , i ' m super allergic to eggs . i ordered N sandwiches , one with " no mayo , please " . douche " sorry , we don ' t do that . " me " they ' re made after i order them ? " douche " yes , but we don ' t make changes . owner ' s rules . " me " i ' m deathly allergic to eggs . can ' t touch it . can ' t wipe your precious house-made chili aioli off . i ' ll still get very sick . " douche " sorry . " me " i see the mayo-less rolls right there behind you . can you just forget to put mayo on one ? " nice stranger " can ' t you make him something without mayo ? " douche " no . " ( " f--- you ! " ) me , leaving with two hungry kids " you and your owner are idiots . " ( " f--- you ! " ) we went to baoguette on lex at Nth instead , great banh mi , your choice of with or without mayo , with or without chilis . . . no attitude . go there instead of giving your money to these jerks . 
good chicken dumplings and excellent pad khee mao . the sauce was some of the best i ' ve had on this standard thai dish . 
my friend had told me about this place so while i was in the area i decided to check it out . nice ambiance with a great beer selection and friendly service . try the shrimp and grits . . delicious ! i ' ll be back for more ! 
caldwell ' s best kept secret ! tucked in a small corner of a strip mall , this amazing restaurant will surprise you with its flavorful indian and thai cuisine . the quality has remained years after their opening which is always refreshing to see . i highly suggest trying the desserts , specifically the mango cheesecake ! i make sure to leave room for that ! 
not my favorite place to get a steak sandwich but they are still pretty good ! 
not my favorite scene . always super crowded and hard to get a drink . i hate that hey put a wall in the middle of the dining area because it makes it really difficult to walk up and down the bar and to the bathroom . i probably would have liked this place a lot better in college . the drinks are always good and i have yet to try the food . sincei haven ' t read amazing things about it , i probably won ' t be running here to try , but would give it a shot if friends were meeting up here . 
this is a relaxed neighborhood bar where all the locals come to chat and drink beer . the drinks are cheap , the food is good , the crowd is friendly . 
really people , the best clam pizza comes out of a can ? ? ? ? ? you have to order N pizza ' s just to get a little full because there is no substance to the pizza . who makes these pizza ' s anyway . i ' m Nyrs old and have been here only twice in my life due to florida family coming to visit and wanting to go to a " wooster street " pizza place because of all the hype . come on people where are your taste buds ? ? ? ? ? 
ok , this is a small place but you will go satisfied . very satisfied . everything they make is fresh and yummy . 
best empanadas in the area
bagels are good , but you shouldn ' t go for your classic bagel with cream cheese . . . this place has a lot of options from meats to bagels to eggs , and the bagels are really good ( not spectacular , though ) . one drawback - it ' s slightly pricey . a bagel with eggs , cheese , and bacon with a small carton of tropicana orange juice was close to N . 
okay , can ' t say enough for the food . the arrogant young waiter we had , a handsome very slim lad , couldn ' t put a damper on our meal , even though he dropped the drinks he was carrying all over my friend ' s legs and didn ' t have the courtesy to apologize . he then came over to our table and did the same thing . the food here is excellent . one thing , they should check this new young waiter on this saturday night - march Nth , and teach him some manners . he tries to tell you what you want . we were being nice , but others in our party were quite upset . the food again was the best . desserts , at N bucks for N N cup portions , seemed to be filler for padding the bill as well as the alcohol . leave the heavy drinkers at home , have the desserts somewhere else . come here for the seafood . 
delish ! my friend and i stopped here for lunch on a road trip . first i love the design of the space- you can tell that ryan his girlfriend steph are trained architects . second the service was great- everyone at the counter was friendly . i had the " italian " soup . we took a brownie , scone and coffee for the ride- oh my ! good thing i live about N miles away ! these folks know what they are doing ! i am waiting for the dc franchise ? ? please ? i will definitely be back on my next pass through philly ! 
i don ' t know where to begin , - ) i went there for lunch i stood in line i waited N minutes . i was totally ignored to the point when i ask to speak to a manager the manager never came out . i believe this to be because i am african american i never felt so disrespected in a place that i intended to spend my money at . i recommend that if you are not of latin descent you are really not welcome in this establishment . i never even got to try the food and wouldn ' t recommend trying to food . i have many spanish friends who told me to try this place out now i regret ever going at all i left feeling less of a human being . 
favorite macaroon salted caramel . delicious ! 
this is the real deal , kids . an interesting style of pizza super-thin crust that is mostly crispy but has a bit of chew to it . this is quite possibly the tastiest pizza available-the taste of each of the structural elements comes through in such a lovely manner , you just want to eat and eat and eat . do yourself a favor and go--now ! ! 
i do enjoy thin pizza , however all i experienced while in nyc was one undercooked pie after another . now i know why new yorkers fold their slices in half while eating them ! the sauce was bland and the slices needed additional seasoning . the toppings list was too limited . the dining space was tight and the servers weren ' t very friendly . the brooklyn pilsner is definitely recommend . overall disappointed with my experience with what is supposedly one of the best pies in new york . 
i was last at dmitri ' s ( fitler ) many years ago , maybe as many as ten years . it was fantastic . i was there recently ( queen ) , and i cannot believe how bad things have gotten , yet they were able to open another location . the octopus , their signature dish , lacked the robust flavor i remember , and it was dry--not the worst i ' d ever had , but certainly on the far lower end . the service was pitiful . no , i don ' t care that the tables are close together , or that it ' s loud , or that the staff need to squeeze around to serve you in fact , these things appeal to me because they make me feel like i ' m not in america , and add to the experience . no matter what you eat there , dmitri ' s is now an american restaurant portions are huge , and include bland sides that aren ' t worth the effort they squeeze your entree onto your table before you ' re done your appetizer--two quintessentially american practices that ruin a meal . the amount of food i imagine they throw out each night must be abominable . doggie bags should be unnecessary in a good restaurant , and you ' ll see many leaving dmitri ' s , i believe out of a sense of duty by some customers . larger portions with less flavor are usually a sign that a restaurant is going under . i wish dmitri ' s would get back to its origins before it becomes completely american . . . that is , closed . 
the surrounding neighborhood is a beautiful and quiet escape from downtown new haven . the brunch selection is vast and so are the rotating lists of specials . food was delicious . i would recommend this as one of my favorite brunch places in the area to anyone . 
this is quite possibly one of the best restaurants have been to . great service , proper coffee and pizza that is to die for . my friend had the cannelloni and the sauce is to die for . this a true hidden gem . thee owners gave us a trial of some other flavour creations they were working on as well . i ' ll be here N N days i ' m here . quality ingredients , fresh and delightful . 
great service , great food ! everything from my mutha mary to the white chocolate bread pudding , all awesome and we will certainly visit again . the kind of place i would feel like i could be a welcome regular . . . my husband is a lover of whole belly clams and he said they were the best in the area . 
cooking like grandma would make . nothing fancy but good old time italian comfort food . looking for flair or romantic ambiance , don ' t come . vinegar pepper chops are out of this world . stop at collandras on the way and bring dessert . 
i think public is one of those solid N-star restaurants . quality , but nothing mind blowing . so my friend and i ordered appetizer fried hama hama oysters with the wasabi-yuzu dipping sauce - amazing ! probably my favorite dish of the night , highly recommended . the fried oysters are wrapped with some kind of leaf and then dipped in to the sauce which all just works so well together . mains venison over dumplings and salsa , and duck breast with a sesame soy dressing - venison and duck breast were both super tender , but the overall dish was okay . the complements to the dishes ( like the dumplings with the venison and the chips with the duck breast ) were good . dessert chocolate hazelnut panna cotta - really standard , wouldn ' t really recommend it , kind of regretted not going for the hokey pokey ice cream my main takeaway for the restaurant appetizer and cocktails were my favorite part , mains could have been done better , loved the ambiance , and would try here again for brunch . cheers ) 
decent food , very good service - but you can do much better in this city for the price point . 
we love this place ! the food is wonderful . definitely tex-mex
nice beer selection , relaxed atmosphere . 
tiny but really nice place . . . N pitchers of sangria and tried the meatballs , chicken skewers and garlic shrimp . . . i am ready to go back to try more . what was nice is i did not feel rushed which is surprising due to the size of the place , so kudos for that ! 
amazing food , spectacular service . my family eats out often and we have been to many great restaurants in and around montclair ( and elsewhere ! ) . this is by far one of our very favorites , and we eat here often . the food is delicious , of a high-quality and expertly prepared . ( best . lasagne . ever . ) and the service is friendly , wonderfully accommodating and professional . we have hosted two parties here , one family luncheon ( about N people ) in the front room , and a much larger evening event using the separate party room in the back plus the lovely outdoor space we also often bring family and friends here who visit us , and have never been disappointed . now this restaurant is not only one of our favorites , but a place our family and friends ask to go whenever they visit in montclair . don ' t miss it ! some favorites ( in addition to the awesome lasagne ) arugula salad with blueberry goat cheese calamari bronzino amazing grass-fed steak salmon chicken parm house-made fusili special with shrimp lasagnetta appetizer . . . . oh , just try it all ! yum . 
there are a lot of diners to pick from in harrison , and they all serve pretty similar food . pancakes , french toast , eggs benedict , burgers , chicken strips , stuff like that . now take everything you know about that type of diner and throw it out the window because tops puts all of them to shame . for one thing , their menu is over N pages long if you include the drink menu . there ' s almost literally nothing you can ' t find there if you ' re in the mood for it , and it ' s all great . they do excellent cheesecakes , and their breakfast foods are always perfect . their burgers and fries are always amazing . they really do a lot of stuff here , and they do it all incredibly well . 
great people great food . . my wife and i had the chicken tikka masala rice platter the kathi rolls . one meal filled both of us . . . . . the next day ( today ) i got the falafel and there tatee fries with masala seasoning for lunch and there mango lassi . all very good great food great price . more than what you pay for i would go there again . N tv ' s to watch while you wait . 
service was excellent could not ask for anything more . however the food was mediocre at best . this place serves small portions of food like a spanish tapas bar . no problem here . but the quality of the food was nothing special . the pork belly ( their signature dish ) was mainly fat . and while some may find the basement quaint is more dungeon like than cava . 
i don ' t really get the appeal . . . i got egg whites with tomatoes on a pita and my friend got the blueberry pancakes . both were fine but nothing special . but they were dirt cheap . we didn ' t have to wait , and managed to score one of the two tables in the back , but expect to sit at the bar with no more than one more person . it ' s nice that they didn ' t rush us , despite the long line . but in all honesty i would have preferred to get a cheap breakfast special from one of the plentiful cafes delis that pepper this area . 
my wife and i love going here . we go to many byob ' s ( very rarely eating in a liquor licensed place ) and august is the most consistent of them all . the owners servers make you feel at home and never rush you out . the menu changes and we have never eaten a bad meal . parking is easy too . 
awesome neighborhood spot for a quick bite to eat . went in on a monday night and sat at the bar . atmosphere and service were both exceptional , and the food was even better . i got the rigatoni with beef meatballs , which were some of the best i ' ve ever had . and best of all , it was only N . this will definitely be one of my go-to places for a quick meal or better yet , some awesome drunk food ( they ' re open til Nam ) . 
i work evenings and get done around nine and this is the only place in town that you can get consistently great food at that time of night . other places may still be open but you are either the only one at the bar or it ' s very busy but the food is horrible . they have a great variety of small appetizers on the bar menu , which i love . the dinner menu is great also . i had the salmon on wednesday and it was out of this world . the oyster selection is really amazing and always taste fresh incredible . i have had just about everything on the menu here and have truly enjoyed it all . kind of funny but two of my favorites are the new york and the grilled N N chicken . don ' t get me wrong the fish is always tasty and cooked perfect but i figured in a fish house they would have sub-par steak chicken , definitely not the case ! it ' s almost like they assume people will think that , so they go above and beyond on those items . 
i should have read the reviews before purchasing a taco here for the first time . apparently i missed out on their really good taco , the adobada . definitely a step up from your normal tacos in terms of freshness and quality of ingredients , but a little on the expensive side . then again , it is located chelsea market . the line was long , but they went through orders really quickly . after you order , you move down the line where you can customize your order ( in this case no onions for me ) . you can then further customize it with their variety of salsas . i ordered a carne asada and nopal both on corn tortillas . the corn tortilla was soft , fresh , and thick without having to layer two of them together . not a big fan of their creamy guacamole . i prefer mine with huge chunks , and what they ladled on top of my tacos was pretty much liquid . carne asada - there was good flavor in the skirt steak and it was pretty tender , but the meat was on the skimpy side . nopal - the cactus was kind of slimy and overall rather tasteless . i regret ordering this one . should have ordered all the meat ones instead . not bad for tacos , but i am spoiled by this taco stand in pittsburgh , where the tacos are cheaper , the chunks of meat larger , and the salsa bar had more variety . i think if i come back to try the adobada , my mind might change . 
sandwiches here are ok price is decent but nothing to crave for . . . 
i have eaten here countless times since they opened and it has always been dependably good . burritos are a staple . fajitas are best shared - huge portions and a bit greasy so a little too much for me to handle alone . be sure to ask what the specials are - they usually have one or two items that may or may not be on the menu that are always delicious . 
customer service was the worst i ever had . very rude waitress . this place has no idea what customer satisfaction is . i complained about my food and waitress said what i got is what i got and it is what it is . asked for manager and manager said the same thing . they are in the business of making money not in the business of serving people . 
i ' ve been here several times , so i ' m not quite sure why i ' ve never written a review before . it ' s great ! first off , this place is popular . so come prepared to wait . the staff is very kind , especially the proprietor , cheryl . she may just be the one to step out and add your name to the waiting list . i ' m typically biased against brunch places that don ' t offer unlimited mimosas . i ' ve been spoiled by competitors , what do you want me to say ? however , whenever i come here i happily order anything from the menu and enjoy each and every bite . i can ' t lie it ' s really good . plus the staff makes you feel as though you were a friend invited over to eat at their home . i ' m an eggs and bacon girl myself , but i hear lots of rave reviews about the french toast . additionally , i appreciate that cheryl ' s isn ' t simply a weekend wonder , they open their doors during week to offer brunch as well . i mean , who decided that you don ' t deserve pancakes and a mimosa when you take a tuesday off of work ? thanks for squashing that unwritten rule cheryl . 
i was referred by someone to go to the juniors in brooklyn but that was a little too far from me i had to take the subway train and do all that bs so i yelped juniors and i saw there was one in time square . so i took a cab to Nth and Nth ave . its located near the marrior hotel still continue on Nth street and there it was juniors bakery . i ordered the original cheesecake and damn it was pretty good ! so if you ' re lazy to go to brooklyn there is a juniors in time square more convienient ! bomb ass cheese cake ! so if you ' re a cheesecake lover gotta check this spot out ! 
the food was decent service was mediocre . 
i ' ve been secretly stalking post office for a while -- watching longingly waiting for the day when i would finally have the energy to brave the m train to go this whiskey-centric locale . when some food nerd friends said they love the chicken liver sandwich there , i cajoled them into coming here again with me . to be honest , not much cajoling was needed . i have to say , my stalking was totally warranted ! the space is intimate close quarters and flattering lighting . the service ninja-esque unnoticeable , fast , and able to anticipate your needs before you do . they moved us further away from the door when a table opened up they dropped off our second round of drinks so stealthily that someone exclaimed , " where ' d that come from ! " they brought us a N N dozen oysters on the house when our food was taking longer than usual to arrive and they were just generally amazingly knowledgeable about the food and drinks . for my first drink , because i arrived a bit late , i felt rushed and ordered the first thing that jumped out at me which turned out to be a drink called the prime time ( N for all drinks on their cocktail menu ) . my first sip of it sent me straight back to college . i don ' t know if that ' s necessarily a good thing but it was interesting , that ' s for sure . i went to school at ucsb and many parties consisted of drinks served from buckets into plastic cups . the list of whiskey was very impressive but i really wanted to check out the mixing skills . my second drink , i decided to go with another cocktail and ordered the tried-and-true old fashioned . much more successful than the first . and the food . oh , the food ! despite the shoebox sized kitchen , this place cranks out some kickass grub . rumor has it the guy manning the stove came from momofuku . i don ' t know what that means but my taste buds sure were happy . they were out of the borscht so i went with the steak tartare ( N ) and the chicken liver bacon sandwich ( N ) . the steak tartare was filet mignon with some sort of spicy awesome seasoning . the chicken liver sandwich was also worth coming back for but i chose to focus all of my attention on my lovely steak tartare . . . you ' re mine . . . all mine ! i totally can ' t wait to resume my stalking on a more intimate basis with you , post office . ----------- i mean that in the best possible way ! 
we ordered delivery tonight , and they completely screwed up our order . i called to complain and they offered to fix it . my wife got hungry , ate half of one of the incorrect sandwiches they ' d sent us , and the delivery man refused to give us the corrected order unless we could produce the first order . i gave him my uneaten sandwich , and he handed me N N of the corrected order . as he drove away , i realized they had , again , screwed up the order . this is not the first time they ' ve screwed up our orders , but it is certainly the last . we ' ve cut them slack , but it ' s not complicated and , frankly , there are other options . i will never , ever order from this restaurant again . 
one of my favorite place for lunch and to kill time . go and taste their oils , preserves , honey , cheeses , chorizos , and ham ! you will probably agree that everything is absolutely delicious . i heart despa a ! 
thank you granny and gramps for living in nyc so i have a reason to make a trip to the eastcoast every year . . . of course to visit you . . and despana ! where do i begin ? this shop is what i call heaven on earth . from the moment i step in , i am greeted by a platter of sliced deli meats to sample my heart away and a massive array of cheeses , which are accompanied by a sample tray as well . a turn to my left and before me lies the most awesome selection of to die for olives , olive oil , sardines , sauces , jams , preserves . . . just everything delicious ! my favorite olives are from here . here ' s a visual for ya despanabrandfoods . com ho the most awesome part about this place are their bocadillos . i am crying tears of sadness as i write this review due to the simple fact that we have nothing ( that i have tried at least ) like this in ca . i highly reccomend the despana and the chorizo bocadillo . if you come with someone , just order both and split them ! ham , creamy cheese , and tomato-garlic spread in a ciabatta bread . . cmon , how can you resist ? 
i ran over to wishbone in late october back when they first opened up and the only thing you could get was chicken and hand pies . haven ' t been back since they rounded out their menu to include other sides , so this review is for the chicken alone . the chicken was tasty , but definitely over-hyped . thumbs up for being boneless . thumbs down for the breading itself being mediocre . the most interesting part of the experience i would say is the dipping sauces . but i ' m biased . dipping food into lots of different sauces almost instantaneously makes my eating experience so much better . i liked the bbq and the chipotle lime mayo . i think if they wanna stick around longer they should keep making different and new sauces ( with having a few of the regulars always there ) and making thicker juicier tenders . my chicken was definitely over cooked . adding sides to the menu is definitely a step in the right direction for this place . 
ended up here by chance on a sunday evening , was pretty busy . the hostess and manager were super nice offered to have our party of N get started with a bottle of wine in bar jamon next door , and once our seats at the bar were ready , they came to check on us twice then carried all our drinks over to the restaurant . portions were just the right size for a tapas place - not too small but also don ' t expect to be full on one or two . 
i made a reservation for brunch a week in advance for a sunday at Nam . the hostess called the day before to make sure we were still coming , and i said yes . she then went on about how they ' re always so crowded for brunch and so many people want to eat there so she had to double check we were still coming , and i again said yes we will be there . we arrived a little before Nam to an empty restaurant . the hostess boasted of the fresh food , and it seemed pretentious . but besides all the seemingly negative vibes we were getting , we really loved the set up of the restaurant and the food lived up to the hype . it was nice to sit at a restaurant where your elbows aren ' t grazing your neighbor sitting at the table behind you . granted the restaurant was empty the entire time we were there so there was no potential elbow bumping , if it were packed as the hostess previously said it would be , we would still have been seated spaciously and comfortably . the food was great , so we ' ll be back . 
really enjoyed my time here ! went during happy hour , which they have every weekday from N-N . it was a great price for some tasty sangria and yummy treats . i loved the guacamole and appetizers . starr gets another star in my book ! also loved the decor and ambiance . 
decent food and the warm cozy atmosphere during a vt winter is really inviting . the onion soup and beef bourguignon was definitely good , as was the service . with that said although the food was good i don ' t think i will be reminiscing about this place when i think about the best french restaurants i have ever been to . i would also say that the price , although not ridiculously expensive , was somewhat surprising for burlington . overall a good experience , and a solid three stars . 
awesome spin on home cooking ! portions will definitely not let you down . i ' ve been here twice now , and both times everything has been excellent . dishes of note bowl of mussels ( gigantic - see my photo ) chicken and pancakes ( has bacon . . . mmmm . . . and the syrup is divine ) and the beer floats for dessert . did i mention it ' s a h ! t load of food ? 
i had a N off deal from scoutmob for this place and went for brunch on a sunday afternoon . first , the service was really slow . it took a while for our server to take our order , and then even longer to get our food . other tables who arrived after us got their food before us . it also took sooo long for us to get our change back after paying that we finally had to walk over to our server ( who was chatting at the bar with the bartender ) and ask him to bring it back to our table . not sure if that was a misunderstanding because when we paid , we said we ' d need change ( which should have been obvious , we tipped on the full price , not the discounted price and if he would have kept the change - it would have been a huge tip ) . secondly , this place had a b rating , which made me a bit skeptical . i noticed that every dish and cup brought out to us had something stuck on , smudge marks , or was a bit grimy along the edges . combined with their b rating , it was very worrisome to me . thirdly , the food was simply meh . i had the crabcake benedict and fresh orange juice . as i said , streaks grime on the edges of the plate , but the quality of ingredients cooking just wasn ' t that great . our food had also cooled off by the time we got it and was only luke warm . would not return to this place unless i had another N off deal , was in the neighborhood , and was just getting drinks . 
miya ' s is like the twin peaks of restaurants . you either find it unique and sensational or an overrated , pretentious mess . i find myself in the former category ( though i still think twin peaks sucks ) . for one , you can ' t really talk about miya ' s without talking about the owner , bun lai , and his unwavering dedication to sustainability . while it certainly means you ' ll find less standard sushi fare on the menu , it also means you can eat and feel a little more socially conscious about the fact that you ' re probably not annihilating the earth quite as quickly as you would ' ve otherwise . miya ' s approach to sushi fusion is all over the place and it begins with the staggeringly long menu full of some of the most bizarre ( and amusing ) descriptions . you could take weeks just reading the menu . you can also blow a lot of money here if you ' re not careful -- but that ' s what separates this place from some other places -- you don ' t have to . there are affordable options on the menu if you choose them , and less than affordable options as well . the service is pretty tremendous . the last time i came here , i received a free spicy misou soup as well as a free appetizer ( of which i have forgotten the name , but they seemed to be some kind of deep fried onion straw-like concoction with an unknown but delicious sauce on top ) . i am a pretty big fan of the italian scallion and the yo yo mitzvah rolls , but you could spend months just exploring the menu . the only thing holding miya ' s back from a N-star rating is some truly outrageous prices on some rolls ( i ' m not sure what ' s in a N dollar sushi order , but it better not get me pregnant ) , and the sake prices are a little much for what you get . yes , it ' s delicious , but N dollars delicious ? hard to say . overall i have always enjoyed my time at miya ' s and i find they provide an interesting , sustainable , and delicious take on sushi that goes a little heavy on the wallet , but hey . . . conscience costs . 
caf habana is so good ! i have been here twice and each time i get something new i love . you definitely have to try the corn , it ' s fantastic and so different . i had to wait both times for a table but it ' s so worth it . i truly love this place and i would go back in an instant . you have to try it . you won ' t be let down . 
so good ! so good ! stunning falafel , incredibly wide delivery zone that is surprisingly speedy ( all the way to park slope ) and excellent excellent baba ghanoush . the zaatar bread pita makes me well up in tears over the years i wasted not having it in my life . nice guys on the phone not the best falafel in the area , hence the four stars . that award goes to damascus with its freshly made salads , pickles and authentic spicing ( pomegranate hello ! ) 
love mykonos ! i ' ve had a couple of different meals . the gyro was superb . grilled vegetables , superb . eggplant pizza , superb . all around , excellent food . and i will definitely agree with the other reviewers in that the place is quite small ( i usually order take-out or delivery ) . also in agreement with the others in that the owner is very nice . great food , highly recommended . 
great food and ambiance . one of my favorites for happy hour . 
oh you halal guys , where do i even start . this was also our " must go to " place on our ny foodie adventure and luckily for us , we had it three times during our stay - also brought some home ! pros - cheap ! N dollars for a gyro chicken plate - they are not stingy ! ( so ask for extra white sauce ) - heaven in your mouth with every single last bite - big portion , enough to share between two people cons - cash only - line is often long , def worth the way - their lids do not fit ! ( causes a problem when i have to carry it across the country ! ) overall N stars . definitely amazing - i waited in line in N degree weather , twice . that was how amazing i thought this place is was for the price ( N dollars ) , the amount of food you get is amazing , it would really feed two people . i got the chicken and gyro combo and it came with rice , lettuce , onions ( optional ) , tomatoes ( optional ) some pita bread . if you let them know that you going to eat it right away , they will just add the white sauce on it for you to avoid the hassle which is even better because you can keep telling them to squeeze those bad boys ( white sauce ) out until forever . do not underestimate their red sauce , a little goes a long way - at least for me ! brought a combo home for my brother and he was sad that i only brought one ! still my top N places to go to when visit nyc again ! 
a fine place some rate it up there with sally ' s and pepe ' s but i don ' t quite , although it ' s close . it ' s outside the wooster square district , maybe that ' s why , but it ' s somewhat easier to get to and into . however , it ' s been getting more crowded lately , and parking always has been tough . they opened a separate takeout door a few years ago which helped some . 
i ' m surprised that there are any good reviews here , much less a large amount of them . i can only guess that none of you fine people have been to any of the south philly taquerias , or hell , even dos segundos . my first review of taco riendo was better than it deserved simply because i love mexican . this time , i can ' t give it a low enough rating . when none of the workers at a " mexican " place have any discernable accent , it ' s a bad sign . i wouldn ' t be surprised to find thart riendo is mexican for bell . after ordering at the counter , i went to the bucket of drinks to see the various mexican soda options . every bottle was warm . i asked for water , and the girl pointed me to an iceless pitcher and a styrofoam cup . the water was also warm . nothing better than pouring your own warm drink . my chicken tacos came out , and in comparison , the water was actually warmer than the food . the salsa , however , is the hottest i ' ve ever had . there ' s nothing wrong with heat if you can still taste the ingredients . all you can taste here , though , is heat . so instead i ordered a side of pico de gallo , which turned out to be about an ounce worth of pico . a N-cent portion for N . it didn ' t matter anyway since they never brought me any bloody chips ! the chicken tacos would ' ve been more aptly named " cilantro tacos . " i couldn ' t even eat the tortilla shells since they had the texture of being microwaved Nx . they were as rubbery as . . . a big , thick piece of rubber ( i ' m at a loss for analogies , okay ? ! ) . the chicken was flavorless , bland and luke warm . i ' m really digging deep for something positive to say about this place , and all i can come up with is the girl at the register was pleasant . that ' s all i got . it ' s not enough to get me to come back . nice knowin ' you , taco riendo . 
love this place . rated number N for a reason . attention to detail . 
bleh - unfortunately all i can comment on the details of this experience . but i completely agree with all the other reviews giving it N star . btw frankie ' s is quite good , as is daniel , gilt and gramercy . but the food here is nothing to match any of those places - it ' s hard to imagine veterans from those restaurants producing what is served here . 
this is one of the worst italian restaurants that i have ever experienced . the meat in the meatballs and lasagna was no better than dog food . my wife took me to this restaurant because she remembered it being good many years ago . she tried my food , agreed with me , and will never return . there is nothing special about thts restaurant . 
my all-time favorite restaurant on either coast for the excellent food and attentive service and relaxed ambiance , and it is the standard by which i hold all other restaurants . the dinner menu varies a bit with the season but is reliably delicious . ( yes , the mac n cheese really is the best . ) sunday brunch is fun and delicious , as well as kid friendly , especially during the early brunch service . ( therefore my suggestion is to wait until about N p . m . ) ) 
such a great experience ! the salad bar is amazing with lots of variety . you could get full off the salad bar by itself if you choose to . the service is attentive , and the quality of the meat served is top-notch . the drinks are also really good . the waiters really pay attention to every table to ensure that diners are always being paid attention to . the venue is also good for events with large groups - came here as part of a large group once and the service and food were at the same level . 
i ' m a carnivore and i love miss rachel ' s cooking . the fact that all of the options are vegan should not dissuade you from trying out her restaurant . you ' ll be too busy enjoying your pastry or sandwich to notice that there aren ' t any animal products . her lunch club meals are super filling ( i sometimes can ' t finish them because the portions are so generous ) and delicious . my favorites are the barb and the wingman and i order them as often as possible . she delivers them herself and she is super sweet . recently i had breakfast at her new cafe in south philly . it difficult to decide what to order so i ended up taking some pastries home after getting a tofu scramble . the community table is a little daunting since i ' m not a very social person , but the other customers are very friendly and welcoming and i really enjoyed chatting with new people over breakfast . the food is fantastic and the environment is cozy and friendly . i will definitely be returning ! 
what happened here- it uses to be so good but it has changed this year . what a miserable experience we had . a big mistake to go to lunch with N people . the service was slow - we ordered and waited forever . all the food was lousy . the kiddies macaroni and cheese came covered with breadcrumbs- what N year understands that ? when i asked to send it back i was told they would charge me for another one ! our fish tacos had almost no fish just a few crumbles but tons of cole slaw the same with the shrimp one . our fried shrimp and scallop was all breading and really small shrimp and only N small scallops the tomato mozzarella salad was of poor quality with mushy tomatoes and firm cheese . with such poor quality food we will never go back again . we all felt abused at this place . 
absolutely love this place ! ! ! i really love this cozy cuuuute place . if i were able to open up a coffee shop , this place would be my dream ! ! ! i like the hard-working lady who owned this place , their lunch special is always delicious and healthy . this place is good for vegetarians too . i wish they close late ! they close so early ( 
joe you ' re so close to being a N banger ! but the mandatory N gratuity , cash only , and you made me feel rushed when i was trying to enjoy the explosion of your extremely juicy dumplings in my mouth . it ' s pretty amazing how much soup they put in their xlb . i had xlb at other places and although some were tastier , maybe less expensive , and even let me take my time slurping their juice , joe packs it in big . it was also nice that joe ' s green pancake was yummy and wasn ' t oily as most others i ' ve had . so here ' s three stars for you dumpling man . see you next time when i ' m in chinatown picking up fake lv . 
i went to this place for the first time last week based on a lot of recommendations . i was told they serve good breakfast and are open Nhrs . . . . my kind of place . when i got there at Npm i was disappointed to find out that they don ' t serve breakfast all day , but my disappointment quickly went away when i received my meal . i can ' t wait to go back and try breakfast . 
i went here for lunch on labor day . the food was fantastic as was the service ! we started off with the tuna tartare , which was in a delicious sauce . next , since we were not that hungry , we shared sea bass special . the fish was cooked to perfection and the kitchen split it for us ahead of time . we finished off with a trio of sorbets which all had unique flavors-strawberry , lime , and mint chocolate . i ' d highly recommend . 
i have been to this restaurant perhaps a dozen times and every single dish i have ordered has been excellent . this has never happened to me before , no matter how good the restaurant . the coconut chicken is to die for . the salmon is excellent , as is the chicken tajine . the list goes on and on . i would also recommend their brunch lunch , which i do when ever i can . everyone i have brought there has agreed that this place has great food . . . 
this place was amazing ! the menu has so many good options that we just had a feast in order to try as much as we could . sangria is awesome and i love the fact that it came in a milkshake glass with a tall spoon to get all the fruit out . a little small so you might be dinning with people you might not know and might have to wait awhile for a table . . . but nothing to complain about in comparison to the food . can ' t wait to come back to nyc and get some more tasty food . 
stopped in since it ' s close to where i was staying and empty . good choice . breakfast took a bit to arrive but was worth it . nice , understated decor . coffee is great here as well . definitely worth a look . 
i am giving ippudo N stars because it delivers on everything that it promises . i have been twice , the second time i went we waited over an hour , and i just don ' t care . everything is good . the service is good . the pork buns are so good that i ' m considering making them the last thing i eat on earth . all of the noodles are great . the green tea creme brulee was disgusting i can ' t believe they even serve it , but again i don ' t care . . . i love this place . 
if i could give good fork N stars , i would . this place was delicious and amazing . what really put it over the top was the excellent customer table service . my friends and i started out with the pork and chive dumplings and an order of the fried green tomatoes which were the special appetizer of the evening . they were great . the dumplings were really some of the best that i ' ve had in the city and the tomatoes were fantastic with the pickled jalapenos and roasted garlic aoli . for the entrees we had the evening special of ribeye with swiss chard , chimichurri sauce , and some kind of biscuit with truffles , my friends order the grouper and the korean style skirt steak with an egg on top . both of their dishes were absolutely delicious . my steak was overcooked . i ordered it medium and it came out well done but when our waiter brought it out he pointed out that they believed it was overcooked and offered me any other entree on the menu . it turned out to be very crispy and chewy so i ended up ordering the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon . by the time my replacement entree came out my friends had already finished their meals . when they brought it out the waiter apologized again and said that since it took so long , they would give me my entree for free . i thought it was extremely generous and wasn ' t expecting it . i ' ve never experienced a restaurant admitting their mistakes and then taking such efforts to remedy the mistake . good fork impressed me with their delicious food but they really amazed me with their customer service and attentiveness . this is not the kind of service that i have normally seen in nyc . i will definitely be back for more of the good fork ! 
it was an amazing experience . they have a little wine cellar above the bar . it was a nice atmosphere with candles everywhere , so it created a nice ambiance at night . get there before N , because the place is pretty small and it got filled up very fast . there ' s a lounge area in the back and wooden stools near the bar . i found out there are coat hooks on your way to the bathroom . i went with my coworker . i ' m also not a big wine drinker , but since i was at a wine bar , why not ? i wanted something sweet , light , and smooth . she and i couldn ' t decide which wine to pick and the waiter was so nice . he was very patient with us and asked questions back to make sure he chose the right wine for each of us . the waiter suggested this french red wine called c t catalanes , c te sud , lafage , languedoc-roussillon . it was N glass . they also go by the bottle too . my coworker is a vegetarian , and i ' m a bit of a meat eater , but the menu had a good balance of to accommodate both of our tastes . we had the slate of crostini ( N ) , which were three toasted bread each with house-made goat milk ricotta , chicken liver mousse , kabocha squash . i loved the squash and my friend liked the ricotta . i ' m a first timer for chicken liver , and i found out i didn ' t like the upper strong iron taste . then we had the beet salad , which was very nice and refreshing . it had pomegranate , walnuts , fresh goat cheese , tarragon vinaigrette in it . we also ordered the caramelized brussel sprouts which had a lime-mint glaze and fried shallots . this was my first time having brussel sprouts and can i please say this dish was amazing and filling ! ! it had a texture of a bok choy , but the glaze gave it a nice light flavor , and the fried shallots tasted like the fried onions you would put on top of a green bean casserole , only without such a strong onion flavor . i had the pastrami sandwich by myself . i wished it was peppered up . it was a little plain in taste in regards to the pastrami itself but i still liked it enough that it still passed in my book . it was juicy , complemented well with the caramelized onions , and had a tint of sweetness from the apples . for dessert we shared a hazelnut ice cream sandwich and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . the hazelnut ice cream actually had real hazelnuts in it ! it was creamy but not too sweet , and it had that nice raw hazelnut taste . however , i honestly didn ' t think it needed the chocolate cake part of the sandwich because i couldn ' t taste the chocolate and it didn ' t add anything to it . the hazelnut ice cream went really well with the homemade cookie . my wine surprisingly went well with the dessert too . it was a terrific experience and the service was wonderful too . i would love to go back again , and the N off from blackboardeats really helped our check , not because the food was expensive but because of the amount of food we ate . ardesia really serves quality food here ! 
the three stars are for the service only , not the food . we had lunch here on a sunday afternoon . not busy at all . there were N of us and it took over an hr . to eat . not one time did they come to refill our drinks . i actually had to get up w my glass to ask for more water . i only saw two employees and the girl at the bar had their undivided attention the whole time . we all ordered different versions of the traditional cuban sandwich . they were all very good . 
great atmosphere love the service . alexis our waitress recommended the best drinks . thanks for making my visit enjoyable . 
lots of good food for a low price . one order could feed a party of N . 
there are enough good reviews , so i figured why write another , but i just wanted to disagree with d . p . maybe they did not like you or something . went to hearth on N N for dinner . party of N . cannot comment on the wine by the glass , but paul ( one of the owners ) helped with the long list by the bottle . why get a glass - two people should polish off one bottle anyway . told him our likes and dislikes and he actually brought us something blind . we drank it rather quickly and turns out it was from lebanon . who knew ? reasonably priced and pretty darn good . went with a more traditional barolo afterward which was fairly standard . i did not get the tasting menu , but the folks who got it gave me some bites . the salad - agree - somewhat uninspired , though the pears were delicious . the pumpkin ravioli though was warm and the filling tasted like i was scooping it directly out of the pumpkin itself . really enjoyed it . delicious . the venison was perfectly cooked and not cold . nice red , almost rare center , melted in your mouth . the apple dessert thing was good , but very sweet . i had the duck egg , a middle course of some of the best damn gnocchi around and the pork special - loin and belly . pork was good , but the gnocchi was excellent . also tried the gorgonzola ice cream and the cider donuts . gorgonzola ice cream is different , but good . basically tastes like cold creamy cheese . i hope donuts on menus do not go by the wayside , because donuts , like bacon , can be eaten at every meal . if i have one complaint ( and this is a big one for me and reason for only N stars ) i think they gave me a cup of regular when i asked clearly for decaf at Npm . was up all night thanks to that . . . . next time i want to sit in the kitchen . 
service was terrible and sent wrong meal . did not make good on anything . most of the time the food was okay , as we use to go there alot but not anymore . do not care about regular customers . brothers pizza is much better and they do care about there customers . 
try the N-flavor " chicken " - it ' s delightful . i have a really strict vegan friend , also a dancer , and this is the only restaurant in nj we could find to please her . always delicious , always friendly . 
this is my go to place for lunch and gas ! healthy , fast , clean and friendly . always fresh and the staff always have smiles on their faces no matter what time of the day it is . 
the worst service ever . i met rude people before , but never like the one who works at gaia . i ' ve never seen someone yelling for N minutes at costumers just because they asked how long more would it take for them to be served . it happened here . if they treat their costumers that way , i can only imagine how they prepare the food . i will never come back again and i do not recommend this place for anyone . 
we have frequented saray for about N months . we always get the mixed appetizer . it is phenomenal--fresh and tasty . just a note that although the dining area is very comfortable and perfect for couples and families--they also serve take-out so you can dine in the comfort of your own home . if you have not tried saray--go today--you will not be disappointed ! 
i bought N restaurant gift card from restaurant . com when they were selling for N and i figured this would be a good local place to check out with it . blue grotto is inside the convention center and next to the radisson hotel . the decor is a mix between italian and french ( as was their music ) . the atmosphere was very nice and the place was bigger than i thought . the menu was separated into N pages . one page for first course and the second page for entrees . they offer daily bruschetta ( tonight ' s was crawfish . . . eww ) , too . we started with the normal mozzarella and tomato bruschetta , which i didn ' t like . it had red and green peppers in it which i thought was odd . i ordered the asparagus and goat cheese ravioli in a vodka rose sauce . at first , i thought it was okay but the more i ate it , the better it tasted . does anyone else have that happen ? jeff ordered their farfalle bolognese . as jeff puts it , " your dish was four stars and mine was two stars " which is why i ' m rating it N . the restaurant is definitely pricey . both entrees were N a piece . i would recommend going here if you ' re tired of all the normal kop restaurants . also , have to give a shout out to the waiter named wafeek . he was pretty damn funny . 
i got the opportunity to support a local band by entering this fairmount hot spot . if you want a change from spaces like johnny brenda ' s or khyber or trocadero or vox populi or barbary or tla or electric factory or transit ( ooooopppss ! they be closed yo ! ) or tritone or bob barbara ' s or avenue q or the guy who peed himself at the corner of Nth bainbridge . . . oh you ' ve been paying attention . so anyway , this is the only venue that ' s way out on the north west end of the city and a hop skip and jump to the infamous eastern state penitentiary if you want to rock out with your wahjiggadeehuh ? ! ? ! out with a bunch of prison ghosts . . . be my guest you freak ! ! ! i wouldn ' t suggest it . but i do suggest you bringing your combat boots for some serious thrashing in this place . . . or whatever ails you ? there is always creative new faces playing , screaming , goofing , or tim and ericing ( ew ! ! ! ? ? ! ! ? ! ) here . even the guy who wore that striped green shirt from blue ' s clues performed here under the name steven burns , which is his real name and his album unrelated to that kid ' s programming is actually quite good . ok , i ' ll quit geeking here . but again geek away b c for the most part there isn ' t much hate here to say the least . you ' re a star at the north star . . . only if you ' re in the band or know the band or paying a round of drinks or tipping your bartenders or you ' re not drinking and have to be the d d to take the rest of the puke-machines home . you ' re not just a star . . . you ' re a superstar ! ! ! . . . actually you just have a freakin ' overload of patience and i commend you but at the same time pity you for not having a beer you creepy uptight " i found jesus in my fruit loops " never kissed anyone but his mom weirdo ! ! ! sorry got to log off now . my mom needs to check her facebook . ) 
they take reservations for brunch ! little to no waiting makes sunday morning so much more pleasant . and of course , the bottomless sangria doesn ' t hurt . i like how they both have white red varieties with lots and lots of fresh fruit inside . the round bread that comes in the bread basket is also soo good . it ' s hard to stop myself from getting full on these alone ! 
enjoyed an excellently prepared meal w N friends , all courses were absolutely wonderful , our service never fell below great considering N of our party were prior to Nnite impossible N please but excellent service prevailed , i have a new favorite italian restaurant , thanx again
pan slices are great here
i can no longer eat pizza in sf . anytime i accidentally do , each bite is a heartbreaking reminder that i ' m far away from the joy that is grimaldi ' s . my thing for pizza is N ) sauce - and grimaldi delivers - the sauce is fresh , flavorful , and plentiful and N ) crust crispiness - again , grimaldi delivers , and the coal oven gives it a different taste than the wood burning ovens you see out west . im getting hungry , dammit . i was a bit sad when i realized its a nationwide chain , but its still freakin good ( and i ate a ton of pizza in nyc ) and theres something cook about the brooklyn location under the bridge with the aging bright green awning and the old school red and white check table clothes . oh and did i mention the pizza is delicious ? a few tips N ) i think it works better if you choose drier toppings , it keeps the thin crust crispier and N ) try to go in off hours - you wont have to wait as much ( or at all as was hte case the first time i went ) and they spend a bit more time on the pizza more deliciousness . 
i went here recently to have a drink with my friend after work . i don ' t think i ' ll be going back again any time soon . they have a nice wine selection , but i wasn ' t crazy about the service . the bartender was cute , but rude . sarcastic and slow don ' t make a very good combination . let ' s just say there are plenty of other place in soho to enjoy , why waste your time on something so-so ? 
this review is filtered through a malbec-colored haze . i met up with a friend here , and we sat at the bar , laughed , cried , drank an entire bottle , and ate some necessary artichoke pizza . it made me want to go on a million dates , it made me want to be in love so i could bring someone here on a million dates . so perfect . 
yummy yakitori and fabulous desserts , although overpriced . . . i left feeling great about the restaurant . then i came down with food poisoning , confirmed campylobacter jejuni , which is associated with undercooked chicken . i did have several chicken items there , including some half cooked livers , and those were pretty much the only chicken items items i had in that time period . just wanted to write a warning about the undercooked chicken they serve . . . i have eaten at a lot of other yakitori places in ny with no problems , so i will not be returning to this place . 
really good mexican place but one of those " fancy " mexican places that is all about the presentation of the dishes . you won ' t find your overstuffed burrito here , sadly . the majority of reviewers are correct . the guacamole is pretty spectacular here . very tasty . got the medium spicy but wasn ' t too spicy . they give you both chips and soft flour tortillas for it . i ordered the pork shoulder for my entree and it was delicious . very succulent and tender . it mixed well with the black beans that came with it and also the sweet plantains i ordered on the side . notably , the plantains had cheese on them which gave them an extra oomph . had a trio of ice cream for dessert that came with peanut brittle sprinklings . not what i think of when i eat at a mexican place but it was most welcome here . i would definitely come back here and come back often if it wasn ' t situated in alphabet city where there is no easy access to trains . cabbys love this hood but now i love it for another reason . this place did not disappoint . 
easy on the hot sauce . 
food is really good and had lots of options for gluten free and vegetarian eaters . also they have huge beers for only N . food choices are very different , i ' m not the biggest fan of kangaroo burgers , but i like the fact that i could get one down the street of i wanted to . 
very good italian food with great service . i love the gnocchi , pasta dishes and the mussels are outstanding . 
four years waiting for this ? really ? i can ' t believe the grade of overrateness the gramercy tavern has . where to begin ? my husband told me about this place long time ago , and i tried to make a reservation since N . never got it , until yesterday . he ate there with a friend ten years ago , and they left the place before desert because everything was disaster . the menu is so boring . this is supposed to be one of the top ten most popular places to dine in new york city . the waiter was a disaster , he didn ' t make appealing any of the menu . we both ordered the steak tartare , it was a tiny plate that just came from the refrigerator , with garlic and salty the taste was bad and dry . the entree was a roasted lamb , it was worse han then appetizer . the bad taste of the lamb remained in my mouth until the next morning . even the wine wash good , but it was the best of the dinner , the dessert was boring , ice cream and a whatever cake . the funniest was at the end when the waiter asked us if we wanted to take out the last little scoop of ice cream that remained from the dessert . are you serious ? it was a joke , and a bad one . the waiter was like a dummy , cold and scripted . the service was very slow . overall , the grammercy tavern became very famous and popular and they live from that . everything is dated here . it is for senior appeal . the main salon was full of grannies . you will save time looking for other new places like le philosophe o lafayette in soho , that is much better . this is a clear proof that a lot of the upscale dinning in new york is overrated and at the end is not worth it . 
hate to hate this place . the food here was cold , old and dried the last time i was here . i think it was because it was on a monday night , there were not that many customers so the kitchen did not want to bring out new fresh food . on a weekend this place can be better . due to more customers and higher turn over of the food . they have huge selections of regular chinese dishes such as general tso ' s chicken , vegetable low mein , etc and as well as sushi , crab legs , dim sums , etc if they can only improve their food freshness and quality on a weekday . i don ' t think i would return again . 
N . N stars . . . northern spy food co is a small little rustic restaurant using great ingredients . the only thing i didn ' t like about this place is they cram a lot of small tables in here so you ' re practically on top of the person next to you , don ' t expect to be having any private conversations here . one thing they have have going for them is that they do brunch everyday . true it ' s more like just breakfast everyday but the care they put into the dishes make it fee like brunch without the booze . it wasn ' t until after i came here that i heard about their famous pork sticky buns so i ' ll have to go back to try that . i ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs ( about N ) . i asked for the eggs scrambled instead of baked and on the side rather than on top . what i received was a side order of eggs ( more expensive ) than just adding on two eggs to the order ( which was clearly what i was asking for ) . also the scrambled eggs were " soft " as they say . technically how scrambled eggs are supposed to be cooked ( according to real high end chefs ) but it ' s not something you ever really find and they should have warned me about as i couldn ' t stand it . the actual biscuits and gravy were very good , not the best i ' ve ever had but a solid dish . 
sandwich military . . the best of manhattan , very good i ' ll be back for sure to try others
i love the outside seating but it is very hard to get a table on the weekends . the staff is very nice the menu has a variety of options . personally i love their chicken cesar salad wraps ! recommend . 
i honestly cannot remember a recent time when i ' ve had a better dining experience ! how salinas has anything below N stars is beyond me . i came here last night for dinner with a girlfriend . the space was cozy romantic . i love spanish food lived in spain for a little while , but i ' m also a vegetarian - it ' s typically hard for me to find many dishes within spanish cuisine . when i told our waitress , she sent the chef out he told me about the extensive vegetarian options they have - i was so impressed from the start ! our waitress explained the menu with intricate detail , and also told us the food is a mix of basque balearic influence . for drinks , i had the salud cocktail ( i believe it was rosemary tequila and cucumber - strong and refreshing ) , and they made a mocktail for my friend who doesn ' t drink . she told them the flavors she likes , and they made something delicious . awesome ! for our meal , we had almost every tapa on the menu ( okay , maybe not , but we had so many ) , and they were all so delicious , better than what i usually ate in spain ! my favorites were the lentil soup , pa amb oli , brussels sprouts and cauliflower , garbanzos fritos , and a tomato and goat cheese dish . my friend also had the crispy quail , which she really enjoyed . we also split the bunuelos for dessert , which were fantastic . at the end of our meal , we were lucky to meet one of the owners , who gave us a little more history on the restaurant and his connection to spain . he showed us the beautiful outdoor patio space out back - i absolutely cannot wait to come dine out there when it ' s warmer out . i just found my new favorite nyc tapas place . i will be back ! ! 
we have been going to baja ' s for a few years now and we have found one thing consistently amazing food . i have read some reviews on here that state that the waitresses don ' t write things down , that is because they know the menu and what is on it . so excuuuuuse me if you don ' t know what your little kid ordered . read the menu and you will also see when sour cream is not included with many of the items . they ask if you wish for some as most people like sour cream with their mexican food . anyway , i will get off my soapbox and state one thing . the food is to die for there . i will gladly pay N for me and my boyfriend to enjoy amazing mexican food ( with leftovers due to the huge portion sizes ) and two margaritas , which might i add are the best ones i have had . ever . every winter the place closes for about N weeks at which point we go and try other restaurants when we crave that mexican taste . every year we are sorely disappointed and we wait for the minute those doors open again . we were in there once again tonight and once again , we won ' t send our friends and loved ones anywhere else . nothing in this area beats baja ' s . 
best in the area . if you like veal , this is the place to get it . most everything on the menu is above average . there are only a few tables , more of a takeout delivery place so if you ' re looking for an eat-in restaurant , this probably isn ' t it . that being said , this is my go to place for no cook nights , which happen far too often . 
the only real diner in the upper valley ! i grew up in west lebanon ( across town ) and the four aces was the diner of choice back in the day . white river had two diners . . . the polkadot and lena ' s lunch . just up the hill from there was the tally house and howard johnsons , but now they ' re mostly all gone . if you ' re in the mood for quick , nothing magical , just coffee and grub , perhaps you might be better served at denny ' s on route Na in west lebanon new hampshire . why waste time talking about the place being " real " ? well , it ' s central to this . . . the folks that own and run the diner are on hand and at your service upon request . there is live chatter at the counter or you can have a seat at a table and talk with a friend . the bottom-less cup of coffee is special to the atmosphere . . . a person isn ' t ever made to feel rushed or herded out like cattle in order to make a turn over rate . daily specials they ' ve got them great attitude they ' ve got them coffee and food they ' re making great food . . . and having fun doing it
i always want to like this place because it ' s so convenient if you intend to go out after dinner , but quite frankly it ' s just not that good and the service is really not that nice . 
my favorite local bar restaurant at the seaport . oysters are always fresh and tasty , lobster special can ' t be beat , and their new brunch items are a nice addition . surprisingly , they can hook up a nice burger and steak too ! definitely worth a visit when you ' re near the seaport financial district . 
beware ! we made a reservation on open table . when we arrived , we were told our table was just finishing dessert . we were offered spots at the chef ' s counter . we did not want to sit crammed in together at a loud crowded restaurant . the chef ' s counter is for walk ins . a few minutes later we were told it would be a N minute wait for a table . again , they suggested we sit at the chef ' s counter . the hostess also told us that we need to specify that we want a table next time we make a reservation . we walked out . there will not be a next time . 
fairly good burger joint located conveniently off of princeton-hightstown road before princeton junction . our first visit was this past weekend , and overall we were pleased with our experience . my date got a single patty burger with cheese , while i went with their chicken sandwich . we shared a side order of french fries onion rings . the food came out fast enough , and it was indeed tasty . i would recommend buying more than a single patty , as there wasn ' t much meat in my girls burger . the cost was rather expensive , and is the main cause the low ( er ) rating . although the food was indeed fresh and tasty , i found it just slightly better than wendy ' s . we ' ll indeed come back often , as my wife really did enjoy her experience here . next time i ' ll be sure to get a burger . 
this place is overrated ! ive walked past this joint many times but was always turned off by the line . one day i finally stuck it out and waited nearly an hour before my gf and i were seated on a sunday . i ordered the miso ramen and i have to admit the broth was nice thick and tasty just the way i like it . a also added the chicken tandori topping for N which was a total rip-off as they probably put N-Noz of it on top . overall great miso ramen but not the best and definately not worth the price ( eg momofuku noodle bar ) . minca in the ev is much better . i have to admit the decor was beautiful . overhyped , overpriced and feels like a tourist trap . 
those were some great tacos . get the chorizo and you won ' t regret it . . . well , your stomach might . 
i ' ve been to greek lady several times over the past couple years . since i ' m moving out of philly soon , i decided to write about this place . my most recent visit was N hours ago . lamb gyro with everything . fries come inside . tastes good . food is not mind-blowing , but it ' s good . price is fair . gyro and a drink N . N a lot of reviews talk about how its hard to eat without making a mess , but its just like every other gyro . eat it from the open side ( duh ) . make a tear on the bottom side ( the pita side ) . as you eat tear downwards along the pita and open the top , spreading the foil out . it gets crowded on weekdays around lunch dinner with all the students and med center employees coming around . but i ' ve never had to wait a ridiculously long time . greek lady has never wronged me . yay ! i ' m a fan . 
i love this place ! we came here for dinner on a sat . night ( party of N ) without a reservation . we checked in at N N pm , and were given a table at N N . although the place is seriously tiny and a little cramped ( with only N tiny , drafty br ) , the service and food were spectacular . the hostess really made me feel like i was dining at the home of a good friend , and she was the mom making sure i was very comfortable and well fed . such great service , i can not say it enough ! we ordered an entree and a few appetizers - the server didn ' t blink twice when we said we would be sharing it . they even sliced it for us ! everything was so delicious . -gravy meatball sliders drool . i was expecting brown gravy , but it was actually a tomato-based sauce . whatever it was , i wanted more . the appetizer is N sliders and bigger than i expected . -truffle mushroom polenta i actually didn ' t care much for the truffle mushrooms - shrooms are shrooms , in my opinion - but i liked the polenta . not amazing , but good . -crispy bell evans half chicken yum ! ! ! this dish is huge ! when they brought it out to us , i thought they mistakenly gave us an extra entree . it ' s seriously more than enough to feed N people . the chicken was perfectly juicy and flavorful , and i loved the crispy topping . more , please ! i ' m definitely returning to check out brunch one day , too ! 
supper we found for a birthday dinner after reading amazing reviews . . . . . we couldn ' t have been happier with our experience there ! ! ! were seated at the bar----because of the crowd , but this is not a bad thing , we had the opportunity to watch the very talented chefs in action prepare our meals right in front of our eyes ! the grilled asparagus appetizer was perfection , while the lemon spaghetti so simple yet so tasty . the special pork chop that night was mouthwatering goodness , we had to go back again for our second birthday dinner . this time it was on a monday night , and we ordered the special-----which we will go back for every monday night from now on , was so succulent and right on . thank you to supper for having this authentic italian haven that is affordable with great service and even better food ! ! ! buonissimo ! ! 
absolutely loved the chiang mai fries ! i had the pad see ewe which was good but not the best i ' ve ever had . service is not so great . had to wait a really long time until the waiter came to take our order . he didn ' t really pay attention to us because of the big group of people that were there before us . still no excuse for lack of service to the rest of the customers . but overall i would definitely come back just for those fries ! 
very good sushi . accommodating service . have to try their sashimi . it ' s very fresh ! 
silk city on saturday nights is like heaven to me ! i was so happy when they reopened last year , i love the updates they made to the place ( especially all the extra bathrooms - yay ! ) dj deejay is awesome and so nice and actually plays things that are fun to hear and even more fun to dance to . i go to silk because i never have to deal with a dj who ' s trying to " school " me like so many of them do . he is what all djs should be like - ask anyone around town . saturday nights - no cover , no douchebags , all fun . hope to see you there ! 
i ' ve been going to tortuga ' s for a couple of years only because its one of the only decent " mexican " restaurants in the area . the food and service can be extremely hit or miss . the enchiladas are pretty decent , the guacamole is simple but expensive , the burritos are way too americanized to bother with and some of the other platters can be pretty good . the last time i went i had ordered the carne asada which was cooked fine , the beans on the side were pretty good same with the tortillas . on the other hand my girlfriend ordered the chipotle shrimp ( normally are good ) , but tonight were undercooked with almost raw vegetables on the side . the restaurant is way too pricey for the average faux mexican food it serves and the wait staff seem to be uninterested . 
never had anything but the square trenton pie , but this pie is so good it gives delorenzo ' s a run for the money--grew up in trenton with great italian restaurants on every corner , most gone now , and highly recommend this pie for anyone nostalgic for the pies of their childhood ! note a trenton pie should be so thin and light that one person could just about eat the whole thing , and it should be seasoned so well that you don ' t have to touch the shaker jars on the table . this pie qualifies for sure . 
great spot at the seaport for a drink and some apps ! came here a tuesday night and it was actually pretty crowded . it ' s a big spot though so we had no problem grabbing a table by the bar . had some wine and the chicken wings and pepperoni flatbread . everything was great- def will be returning ! 
awesome food , great service . get the bob burger-- blended grass fed beef bacon brisket . it ' s off the chain ! 
best tapas place i can think of in new york . everything sounded so good on the menu , we had a rather difficult time to pick . and we definitely went overboard with the sampling . we did ask our waiter for recommendations and he was most helpful . i forget all the tapas we ordered , but there was brussels , goad cheese with honey , bacon wrapped dates , meatballs , among other goodness ' . . . the setup is also well done . let ' s start with how unpretentious is it from the street , almost missed it . walk down a couple of steps and be greeted by friendly bartenders waiting on quite the number of people at the long bar . it ' s either a wait for a table or just happy hour crowd but busy nevertheless . then inside the restaurant area i couldn ' t pin-point where it reminded me of but somewhere abroad with much history . liked the opening where the tables upstairs felt like part of everyone on the main floor . can ' t wait to go back ! 
way over rated and over priced . not even close to the best pizza in brooklyn . have no idea why people go back and wait in line for a place that gets closed down by the board of health every other month . 
we had a groupon to try out this place last night . we were expecting a somewhat decent meal , but it was a flop . the three is mostly for the attempt , location and atmosphere . we started out good actually with being seated in the bar at a tall bar table . our service was sub-par . i feel more comfortable when the staff takes an order with pen and paper to start . for most of our dinning experience our waitress was mia . i mean really . she spent most of her time tending people at the bar with the bartender . never mind attending to the tables around the area . the food was basic and mediocre . the app of stuffed mushrooms was the highlight of the night and it was pretty tasty . it was smooth and had great flavor . it all went down hill after that . my ginger shrimp cakes were hard and tasteless . the spinach and mushrooms needed salt and my friend ' s pretzel covered salmon was dry and hard . the dessert was blah . we had the brownies topped with cookie dough . it looked lovely , but when you got into it the brownies tasted like they had been microwaved where the edges were hard and the middle was soft . i like fresh dessert , heck i like fresh food . it was really nothing amazing . pros -great atmosphere with its lively bar . -clean and new . -moderate to high prices . cons -poor service . -the food isn ' t that great . -plan on paying for parking . i ' m not in a hurry to visit this place again , but i have to admit it has great potential . hartford has some good places . 
this is where i got the most authentic shanghainese food in the greater ny area . i particularly like the braised pork knuckle in brown sauce ( ) and braised fish belly ( ) . the braised pork knuckle was just like from the kitchen of your very patient shanghainese grandma . as a chinese from the area around shanghai , i know it has to be braised for at least N hours to get rid of most of the greasy fat . the pork simply melted in the mouth and the tastes reminded me so much my old time when i was still in my hometown and enjoy it there . . . the fish belly is relatively quicker to braise but that doesn ' t mean it ' s easy - it ' s all about the timing . . i am confident to tell if the fish is overcooked by merely a half minute but the dish i had in this asia bistro seemed to be done just right . . . i would highly recommend this restaurant if you are around . i often visit chinese restaurant in nyc but i don ' t think i had anywhere better there . 
omg , get the grilled shrimp , grilled shrimp , grilled . . . . mnh nam nam hanmn nam . . . . . . . thats me salivating over the grilled shrimp . go out and get it now , like right now . go , go i tell you ! ! ! 
though the wait is often terrible i ' ve never had a bad experience with the food . the portions are large and i usually never finish my food , luckily my boyfriend is a fan as well and tends to finish what i don ' t . i honestly would have given a N star rating but what really bothers me is the tiiiiiiny little drinks they give you that never last through the entire meal , when i ask for an orange juice i don ' t mean a shot and i ' ve noticed customers who the staff clearly knew getting special treatment . 
gustos is great for the price . their pizza is excellent . calzones are great . get the meatball pie if you ' re ordering pizza , can ' t go wrong with any of their calzones
amazing arepas . perfect drunk food after happy hour at the beer garden . good prices . not that much space . for more space go to their sister restaurant arepas grill . 
not because of the food but the attitude - stopped by on way home around Npm - walked by many times never tried it - was quiet there and the perfect spot - nice lady said hi as i looked at menu outside - i asked what time it closed - she replied N . N for the kitchen - i said perfect ' sold ' all started out well - however . . . . . . silly me - i missed the ' obvious signs ' posted on the ' open door ' and ' above ' the menu that ' no credit cards that night ' --i ordered and enjoyed my meal - caught up on some work and handed over my cc for payment to be informed by waitperson - " we don ' t take cc and in same breath quickly advised that it was posted on the door " - i said i wished they said that when i was outside looking at menu - to be lectured again that the sign is on door and above the menu . . . . sorry . . . . . . . i wasn ' t looking at all the window and the open door - i just wanted to have something to eat ! ! ! - - explained i didn ' t think it was a good first impression - i went to person ( eating her dinner at bar ) who originally greeted me and asked if she was manager - she said no - i shared my concern - she advised me that it ' obviously a big deal for me as you are raising your voice ' . . . . . lame - - i advised her i was not - of course i was only patron now ( about N . Npm ) so they decided to go for kill - her colleague again shouted at me about the signage - i told that person i didn ' t want to engage her i simply explained to the person at bar my concerns that it was not ' best first impressions ' - the answer was ' i have been standing on my feet for N hours ' . . . . . sorry that is a customer issue ? again , they decided they were on a roll as i was only patron - i finished by complimenting the food again . . . as the whole kitchen staff were now standing inside staring . . . unfortunate for what should have been a simple good experience . . . . . . management owner if unsure take a look at your security cameras N - N . Npm
i liked the previous owner , and was disappointed when epernay closed . missing good french-bistro food , we tried the new-old owners reopened fricassee , and i ' m pleased to say it was even better . the mussels ( moules ) mueniere were the best i ' ve ever had ( we ' ve been to nice and paris , and fricassee beats them ) . beef bourguignon was excellent ( liked the tiny carrots too ) as was the cassoulet . atmosphere is nice , and service was pretty good ( not pro , but trying ) . byob makes it a good value too . definitely worth a visit if you have a hankering for french ! 
great and good
ryan was the best , she ' s super professional and lovely ! will be back . 
so . jimmy came home one day and started frantically raving about this sandwich he had . the " thanksgiving day anticipation sandwich " that bubby ' s serves in tribeca . something about turkey , stuffing , cranberry sauce , and cream cheese . sounds weird , but flipping amazing . plus , he was raving . so . i would like to check out this sandwich , naturally . jimmy takes me and krystle there for lunch on a saturday at roughly N Npm ( they serve all day , no breaks ) . they give us the N-Npm menu ( okay , so we ' re technically in time for the previous menu , but i ' m a human being and i understand if they want to switch to the next menu N minutes early ) . problem is , the turkey sandwich isn ' t on this menu . fuck . oh well , we ' ll try something else . ten minutes later ( ! ) , we are finally greeted by a server ( not ours ? ) . order drinks . fifteen minutes later ( ! ) , we receive our drinks . another ten minutes later ( ! ) , we finally get to order . now , i understand there ' s a weird switch over going on , but you ' d think that if they ' ve been doing this for a while , they would have figured out how to not make their guests wait so long for some sort of service . however , i ' m a human being , i understand . moving on . i order a burger , medium rare , side of mayo ? " sure . " okay . ( i like my burgers with mayo . really , it ' s the only thing i ' m picky about when it comes to food . granted , i ' ll try a great concoction of a burger sans mayo , but this burger only has one sliced tomato and one leaf of lettuce--not an original creation . ) N minutes later ( ! ) , our food arrives . N minutes after we order . now , you should understand that krystle , jimmy , and i can have great conversation . we can amuse each other for well over N minutes . we ' re just not too fond of waiting for food for N minutes when we ' re particularly hungry . however , i ' m human , i understand , etc . now , no server ( do we have one ? ) comes to our table after our food is dropped . i ' m missing said promised mayo . i wait roughly ten minutes to see if i can score some , but no one ever really comes near us ( i may not be a professional server , but i know how important that approach-after-food-is-dropped step is ) . opting to not have a cold burger versus probably not getting any mayo anyway , i sadly give into ketchup . i also find out that it ' s about medium well . darn . cliff notes of the rest of the meal takes N minutes to get the table cleared after we finished , and ten more to get the check . we ' re immune to bad tipping , but i don ' t think i ' ve ever put down my usual N so unwillingly before . that was N for N , bubby ' s . second attempt in the area for lunch with a friend around N Npm . decide to give the search for that turkey sandwich another shot . upon entering , i ask to see the menu before we ask for a table . yep , sandwich present on the special ' s list . done . table for two , wait ten minutes ( good , considering how busy it looked ) . sit down , anticipating an anticipation sandwich . pretty happy . busser comes up to us for a drink order , then proceeds to point towards something on the special ' s list . it ' s the god forsaken sandwich . kind of loud , can ' t hear him . is he telling me it ' s good and i should try it ? no . " by the way , we ' re out of this . " i ' m not one to cry , ever , but i think i came close . ( bubby ' s is out of what is probably the most popular item they have on the menu at N Npm ? wow . ) N for N , bubby ' s . you ' d have the luck of flopping a royal if i considered trying again . ( which . . . i ' ve flopped a royal before . there ' s hope , especially since i want that freaking sandwich . ) 
i ' m totally ordering from banana leaf again--it ' s super decently priced , delivers in center city , and reasonably consistent in food quality . i ordered the thai basil noodle , which i ' m not sure was a good idea . i actually came to yelp to see what to avoid , and what was the most popular dish . it wasn ' t as spicy as it was hyped up to be ( but i have really high tolerance for spicy foods ) , but this might be one of those dishes that doesn ' t travel well . my boyfriend got some sort of chicken curry , which was pretty tasty . this was paired with a coconut rice--highly recommend that if you ' re carb-hungry . as an appetizer , we split the buffalo wings , which were unremarkable , but not a total fail . again , cheap , easy , and they deliver ! new go-to for asian delivery , woohoo ! 
best bloody mary i ever had . . . . went for saturday brunch , really calm mellow vibe , i liked the crowd . . . the place was very busy but things seemed to be running smooth . i got a burger it was perfect , n my friends seemed to enjoy their meals as well . . . . would definitely recommend . if i was in the area i ' d go back again
the food here is good . the grandma slice is delicous . the customer service leaves something to be desired . the owners wife is constantly yelling at the employees , i feel like every weekend when i come in there they are mobbed busy and she is yelling . besides the fact that she is very nasty ! the rest of the employees look completely miserable , guess i would be too if i had to work for her . they are not friendly whatsoever and dont even try to order for delivery they have no idea how to manage their deliveries , they cant even deliver in a N minute time frame . . . which is completely ridiculous ! 
happy hour N cheese soft tacos are delicious ! ! ! ! as a vegetarian i ' m very pleased with the array of options that el rey has to offer . staff has always been very friendly and accommodating . 
this place may be small , but the food and service are excellent ! i love sushi , and after trying several places , this is hands down the best i have found in philly . 
easily N stars ! ! ! this place has been recommended to us about a dozen times and we tried it saturday night for the first time . who woulda thought we ' d find such a spectacular place to eat in the middle of the woods . we were seated immediately on a saturday night even though the place was pretty busy . decor was warm and inviting and the staff was friendly and efficient . i started with a butternut squash soup which was garnished with a little swirl of sour cream . it was delicious . my boyfriend had the keeper ' s salad with sherry vinegarette , which i tried and was terrific as well . for my meal , i had the pasta special which was penne in a garlic cream sauce , with smoked chicken ( which couldn ' t have been tastier and more juicy ) , cold , roasted roma tomatoes for a little contrast with the hot meal . the whole dish was covered in parmesan cheese , walnuts and chives . it was maybe the best thing i ' ve eaten in years . my companion had the bangers and mash , which he loved and which i tried and loved as well . the bangers were out of this world , although i still loved my own dinner more . came with gravy , spinach and apple sauce . to finish i had the maple creme brulee and nicky had the flourless chocolate truffle pie . my broolay was a little on the overdone side , but underneath was still delicious and it didn ' t affect the N star rating . the menu changes daily , which bums me out a bit since i would love to get the pasta thing again . and not that you will , but if you find yourself in the area , definitely go . 
i am a returning customer and i was really looking forward to another meal at doma . unfortunately my meal was ruined by the shittiest service . the server looked and seemed drunk . it took about N minutes to get an ice bucket for a bottle of wine and when the check came they wouldn ' t accept an american express gift card because " our system thinks this card is expired even though it isn ' t " . food was good but when you ' re paying that much for a meal , i would have liked a better experience . 
good
a fellow chef of mine turned me onto this place and i have to say it was very good . the menu was simple and safe . i guess that is harder to screw up . i have to agree with most of the reviews i ' ve read about raymond ' s , trying to have a conversation in there is quite challenging , but not impossible . raymond ' s is byob , i personally don ' t mind . i did get to find a very nice little wine , beer shop next door . suprisingly priced modestly . the owner there seamed to be passionate and very helpful about helping us find a good selection . their is no cork charge , and icing to booze is on the house . serve was excellent , very attentive without hovering . i loved the decor , it was bright , clean , fun , N ' s , N ' s feel . dinner at raymond ' s was basic . app . sauted mushrooms over truffled polenta . entree meatloaf with mashed and brussel sprouts both were very good . seasoned well and cooked perfect . mashed pots were creamy and not over cooked . meatloaf was not my mothers but not over the top . if you are looking for cozy , affordable , and predictable , this is a great place to stop into . 
i definitely agree with everyone else here - the food is overpriced and bland . i remember walking out of there last night telling my husband that if i didn ' t order the mexican street corn as a side with my entree and the pitcher of ( red ) sangrias that we shared , i would have been really upset . -appetizers we started with the queso fondito with peppers which was okay . it was very greasy , but was good enough to settle a craving that my husband had . -for the entrees , i ordered the carnitas tacos which automatically came with a side of beans . the was really disappointed because the pork meat itself - although tender had no flavor . the worst part was the side of beans . . . they were semi warm and still had the aluminum can taste . . . there was absolutely nothing added to them ! ! my husband ordered the short rib tamale which he really enjoyed , but the portion was a tapa-like portion at a fabulous price of N . -for dessert , my husband got the churros with hot chocolate ( which was luke warm ) , and i ordered the chocolate tres leches . the desserts were not great but not horrible . -service at first , the service was fantastic . . . we had our appetizer and first round of margaritas delivered to our table within N minutes of being seated . however , once we received our dinners and sangria , it ' s like the waiter forgot we existed for the remaining N minutes that we were there . -overall if we didn ' t have a groupon , we would have been really upset but with the discount , the bill wasn ' t too bad for a mediocre meal in philly . -tip if you want authentic mexican food , take a drive up to conshy for el limon . 
our table ordered the lockhart deal - each person gets a portion of each of the meats and sides , and it was friggin fantastic ! loved the pork belly and the chicken , and the cornbread was great . it also came with a dessert , and i ordered a root beer float . i normally hate floats but gave it a shot as i wasn ' t in the mood for cake , and i did not regret it . my friend also loved the hell or high watermelon beer . my only complaint is the whole table has to order the lockhart or they won ' t serve it , which was a minor nuisance because some at our table wanted to order their own meals . but peer pressure got the better of them and they did not regret it . 
food was great however the service was really poor . waiters were forgetful and not that friendly . 
i also stopped in on a weeknight , and basically can echo the previous review . this place looks great inside . i never saw it before the renovation . non-smoking is a major plus . i sat at the bar , which was very busy for a weeknight . fast turnover of customers . locals drop in , grab a burger and a drink or two , and head out . the atmosphere was laid back and friendly . lauren was behind the bar , and she is friendly and professional , without being over the top . my martini was perfect and ample . i didn ' t eat , but N of the people at the bar ordered burgers . they looked delicious , and no one complained . i stopped in a few weeks later early on a friday night and the place was jam packed . that is not my type of scene , so i left immediately , but i was impressed that they could draw that kind of crowd early . the continental benefits from its central location , ample parking , and the fact that probably half of yardley ' s population can walk to the place . no real competition is a nice factor in their favor as well . all they need to do is keep up the good work , and this is the place where people in yardley will go for a drink and a sandwich . the yardley inn is just a few blocks away , but it ' s a totally different scene . 
i am venezuelan and i was so excited about this place so i went there few weeks ago . i know i probably have high expectations since i am venezuelan but this place is not even closed to be a venezuelan restaurant . the food was just ok , too salty and the service is horrible . only N waiters for the whole restaurant and even tho it is small they need more help . i asked for a natural juice and i had to wait N minutes for it and i ordered an arepa which is the easies thing to do in the world and they took at least N minutes to bring it . . . . never come back to this place . 
the food level at this place goes down each time we have come in the past few years . salad bar was the worst lettuce soggy , hearts of palm unable to cut much less eat , cracked wheat salad had a gritty taste in the parsley ( sand ) . trying to get a taste of the different meats was near impossible . the chicken wrapped in bacon smelled like dog and was dry . coffee came out cold . seems like another is gonna bite the dust . 
love exotic food . don ' t expect to be disappointed . they have a huge selection . the wait time is not long . the deserts are to die for . i took a work buddy here and we split the bill , very fair . parking can b e pain the ass . but queens is a like the city . i ' ll be back
i went here because i was impressed when i saw it on the food network . we ordered what we saw on the show and i am not sure if it was an off day or what . . . but i know guy fieri was not oohing and ahhhing over what i got served . really oily and kinda not good . my dinning partners all agreed it was over rated . i will go back and give it another shot but we shall see . . . fingers crossed . 
consistently delicious pizza and spumoni . worth the trip ! 
maybe other people like greasy , oily pizza , but i don ' t . the crust , sauce , freshly grated cheese and basil are tasty enough , but dumping a bottle of olive oil , evoo or whatever it is , doesn ' t do it for me . waiting an hour or more for this pizza in my humble opinion isn ' t worth it but friends from out of town always want to come here and some actually like it . go figure . 
how do you feel about korean food ? i think after you try a meal or two from pick mix you might decide it ' s for you . i have always had an appreciation for asian dishes and while not all of them agree with me , most do . i have been forever wanting to try this gem of a korean ' joint ' and finally had the chance to do so this week . i ' m glad i did but sorry it ' s taken me so long to get here . i had the beef bi bim bap bowl and it was a good thing no one could see me eating because i practically inhaled it with chopsticks . a perfect mix of rice , veggies and beef you choose whatever you want in it and served up with a delicious lemon sauce . i really think this is one of those worth-finding-hole-in-the-wall joints if you ' re up for something that ' s delicious and pretty inexpensive too . 
the food is good , the chicken francese was amazing but i didn ' t like the pizza no flavor and too dried for my taste . sadly the service was awful . . . then again the people sitting at the other tables seemed to be well taking care . . . . all i have to say is . . . racism still surrounds us so if you are a respectful latinamerican that enjoys the good italian cusine stay away from here if you don ' t desire to be disappointed . 
this was the best chinese food i ' ve ever had . and i ' m not a chinese food snob . it wasn ' t greasy or oily or covered with all kinds of who-knows-what sauces . i had vegetable fried rice , it was full of vegetables , good ones , and nary an onion to be found . the rice was actually fried , not sloshed around in an oil-filled wok . shrimp and broccoli , perfectly cooked broccoli , the smaller size shrimp ( not the giant ones which are too chewy ) . and fried vegetable dumplings which were huge and beautiful and filled with chopped mushrooms . the price was close to what you ' d expect to pay at a takee-outee . i don ' t think i ' ll ever get chinese food anywhere else again . 
upon entering the cheesy devoted restaurant i approached the hostess who may have been retarded . i informed her that i had a reservation and she didn ' t seem to know what that meant . i asked for an outside seat and was understandably told that there would be a wait for it . i made my way to the bar and waited for one of three bartenders to serve me liquor . one did greet me and ten i waited again . the restaurant is loud and " busy " and the service didn ' t get better . eventually after a no problem amount of time i was seated outside . 
went here for brunch yesterday and it was great ! we walked in around N N and were seated right away . . . i ' m pretty sure we beat the crowd because by the time we were leaving the inside and patio were packed . the food is really tasty , went with a party of four and we all shared entrees . the list is as follows asparagus and mini crab cakes for starters , jim cade breakfast ( french toast , eggs , grits , bacon ) , eggs benedict , crab cake sandwich . over all it was a good experience the entree portions are huge , there was a live jazz band , they have outdoor seating , and the staff is really friendly . i gave it a four because they do not allow substitutions at all if you want something different you have to order it as a side which is like N N bucks . . . i don ' t know that really bugged me . also their drink menu isn ' t that appealing and what ' s brunch without a nice cocktail ? 
so-so place . it ' s a little tight , service is hit and miss . i had the mussels the other night--they were oversized , over done , and didn ' t taste super fresh . overall there are better places in this neighborhood at this price point . 
i had a great brunch here last week . great granola with yogurt good coffee and loved the egg sand . i will be back for dinner . 
oh , tia pol , how i love thee ! the ingredients are always fresh and delicious ! the variety of tapas is perfect for food-lovers who like to try a bit of everything . i always get the patatas bravas , croquettes , artichoke salad , and blistered peppers with sea salt . they lamb skewers are also to die for and so is the chorizo . a friend who i dined with doesn ' t eat meat and another friend doesn ' t eat carbs , but there were delicious dishes for all of us at tia pol ! 
just ordered delivery from this place and it was so good ! i had the tuna dumplings , which were a little on the messy side when they arrived but i ' m overall satisfied with them . i also ordered the fantastic roll . can you tell i ' m obsessed with tuna ? i would definitely order from here again . 
awesome service , awesome food , great environment ! ! ! ! totally worth the wait ! ! ! 
i am so happy this place is in the neighborhood . i want to move in here . excellent coffee and baked goods for morning , wonderful sandwiches for lunch . now they are open or dinner ? i must go ! seriously , rybread has great food and such a nice staff . i hope they have a long and successful run on fairmount avenue . 
not only was the food delicious , but the people working there were super nice and understanding of the brunch time rush of customers . they give free coffee , fries , and oranges as snacks to keep people on the line and the food usually comes out quite quickly . we ordered - huevos rancheros - not the fanciest looking , but filled with flavor . i loved adding the spicy mayo on top and mixing it all together . for some reason reminded me of sophie ' s . - bacon on a danish pancake - freaking sweet and fluffy . i ' m not one who normally eats sweets for breakfast , but this was just so good . remember to bring cash and expect a long line for regular rush hour weekends . i ' d definitely come here if you ' re near the brooklyn museum and botanical garden . they have a weird exhibit on high heels right now . 
this restaurant is so good that it finally motivated me to join yelp so i could write a review . it was a pleasure to experience great food and outstanding service . my husband and i were greeted warmly upon our arrival . i was in the mood for a light dinner so i chose the antipasto bar . what a pleasant surprise -- not the typical selection of fatty , salty fare . our waiter -- jr -- was very helpful in suggesting items i might like . i eventually decided on three salads quinoa arugula , beet , and lima bean with cubes of a sharp cheese ( i think it was provolone ) . all were delicious . there were many other wonderful selections as well . for my main course i had the vegetable minestrone ( i think it had a touch of pesto ) . a perfect blend of flavors . my husband ordered the lasagna , which was served with a thick meat sauce . also delicious . next time we will definitely order the thin crust pizza for an appetizer . trattoria dell ' arte is a great choice for a pre- or post-carnegie hall event . 
simply the best ! we ate there , ordered out now even get delivery from there . their price is unbeatable nice , authentic atmosphere , and great service ! our favorites are the specials they have in the menu especially the fish and the lunch special . my friend is a vegan and she loves their food and they have lots of options for it . summertime patio is a must go ! only con about this place is byo wine ! some people think it ' s a plus but i like to get my wine according the food in the restaurant . still the best place for the price they have ! i mean you are having a meat for N and it comes with extras ! tip try their stuffed cabbages ! 
food is delicious but its freaking expensive . if you ask for a salad with feta cheese on top , they will charge for feta N bucks . 
i loved hillstone from dallas and when i found out they have it in new york too , i was so happy ) brought my boyfriend here right away after i found out ! i love love love their hawaiian ribeye ! best ribeye ever ! it ' s so full of flavor and that ' s what i love about it because many ribeyes i feel don ' t have much flavor unless you put a ton of sauce on it but i really really love the hawaiian ribeye . whatever they put in it , i hope they never change it ! 
the boil is a great place for a large group and even for dating . i had visited this place twice in a month . they have varities of seafood choice such as crawfish , crableg , shrimp , and clam . so you can order them by the weight . their special sauce is delicious and must try . although this place is famous for crawfish , but i think crableg taste better than crawfish . 
chicken ceasar salad hummus plate with vegetables . it ' s a decent meal , comes quick and they don ' t leave you hanging . 
the first time i had your food , a coworker ordered it and it was wonderful , so i was excited to go there in person . getting there today , i was pretty nauseated to see that the bathroom and outsides of the kitchen machinery were filthy . the orders took a long time and then came out wrong - my doctor sandwich came out with horseradish mayo instead of the honey mustard on the menu and with tomatoes and without lettuce even though i had requested the opposite . the turkey was skimpy and the sandwich was too heavy on bacon . yikes ! after you ' ve deepcleaned and improved your staff , let me know and i ' ll try again . 
one of my favorite dives in queens in short . this place is one that gets overlooked from many native nyers as i don ' t think many know about how amazing the food here is . boy oh boy this place has it right and it is extremely affordable . the people there are warm too and will give free samples to let you try different foods . i try to hit this place up at least N-N times a week , but this place gets reallllllly busy at certain times due to the small size of the restaurant . empanada cafe in corona is the only other place in this city that hits a home run in this cuisine imho . top notch ! ! 
yum ! ! uncle moustache deserves five stars ! ! the owner ( our waiter i ' m only assuming was the owner as there was no other wait staff in the place ) was so generous ! he gave us a free dip with our appetizer and a free dessert ! ! now on to the delicious good things ! ) first of all , the decor is awesome . i love french antiques , as i am french and grew up living with my grandmother who had tons of chotchkies , so i felt at home ! the background music is also chosen impeccably . i enjoyed listening to all my favorite indie bands while enjoying conversation and the food . we were a little confused when we walked in as there was nobody to be found besides the ' pitza guy ' ( i ' m not really sure what to call him , my apologies ) . my girlfriend and i were looking for someone to give us direction as to what to do , but they we couldn ' t spot someone so we asked said pitza man if we should just seat ourselves and he nodded . once we sat down , a man ( i presume the owner ? ? as there was no other wait staff for the evening ) greeted us and offered to open our bottle of wine right away . after our wine was poured , he asked what we were thinking for an appetizer . we ordered the mezze sampler for our appetizer and we couldn ' t really decide what we wanted , so the owner was generous enough to offer to choose for us ! he even gave us an extra dip on the house ! oh and another perk ? they actually ask you if you would prefer whole wheat pita or regular pita ! we chose whole wheat and the pita was piping hot when it arrived to the table with the platter , just as i like it . the dips were smokey and delicious ( i ' m not really sure what we got one was definitely hummus and another eggplant dip but i don ' t know the rest ) . as for our entree , i got the ouzi and my girlfriend got a chicken pitza ( i don ' t remember the name of it , but i ' m pretty sure all of their pitzas are delicious as this one was yummy ) . our dishes arrived quickly , and extremely hot ! i was amazed as i ' ve never had food arrive to the table this hot and so fresh out of the oven ! our dishes were giving off heat like nobody ' s business . my ouzi arrived very crispy ( you could actually hear it crunch under my knife and fork ) but with nothing on the plate . in addition i was missing the yogurt sauce . about N minutes later he arrives with the yogurt sauce ( he was busy and i presume he forgot ? ? which i understand as i used to be a waitress and have been alone once or twice and know how hectic it can get ) . besides this , the ouzi was incredibly delicious . i usually don ' t like raisins in my food , but they added to this dish . the ouzi was incredibly flavorful . the rice was not overcooked ( this happens sometimes when you stuff it into things ) and the chicken was tender ( i later wished i ordered the lamb ouzi ) . my friend ' s pizza was so crispy and cooked to perfection . it was very light and satisfying . by the time we were finished eating we were stuffed and couldn ' t eat dessert ! ! we just ordered coffee it took about N min to arrive and he wasn ' t brewing it fresh as the coffee pot was in plain sight , but the owner somehow overheard my girlfriend was taking me out for a belated birthday dinner and he brought us a free plate of dessert and wished me a happy birthday ! ! it was a pistachio baklava ? ? and it was simply delicious ( i don ' t really enjoy dessert , mind you ) . i will most definitely be returning to uncle moustache in the future ! ! my only suggestion , don ' t be afraid and add more lebanese dishes to the menu ! ! 
i live N blocks away and i rather to go to lava then any of the other coffee shops around , i love the food the coffee and i think the stuff is great . i fell like home there and the owners allways try to give their N , even when they r busy . lava is more then a coffee shop , it s a community , i remember how that block looked before lava opened . i think u guys are great . 
lives up to the hype , the real deal . tasty , quick and huge portion one of the best deal in town
i was really impressed by this place . it is very similar to the nearby banana leaf ( my review yelp . com biz banana-leaf ) , which i was equally impressed by . they are so similar in food , price , decor , that it is hard to distinguish them . i will say , i think this place has a very slightly nicer decor . but the decor is very similar--big , dark , and kind of open . this place is a bit brighter , bigger , and more open , but still basically dark . prices are very reasonable . you can eat for under N a person , and the quality is exceptional for this price range . i came here with my dad he ordered the hainan chicken , it was outstanding . . . very tender ( steamed ! ) chicken on a bed of cucumber with some carrots , rice on the side , and a very flavorful sauce that was spicy , tangy , and had some interesting and novel flavors . i had a fried rice noodle dish with egg , mixed seafood , and bean sprouts . both dishes were outstanding . service was good . the menu here is huge , i really would like to come back and check out more of it . the food is vaguely reminiscent in some ways to thai food , but it has a more mellow flavor , less sweet , less sour , less spicy . the only thing i found slightly lacking about the menu is that many of the dishes are a tad heavy on the carbs and meat , more so than , for instance , thai food . but they are still fairly balanced . my only other complaint about this place is that i do not think that spiciness ratings correspond at all to the spiciness of the food . my dish was marked spicy and had no noticeable heat or peppers in it , my dad ' s was not and his came with a sauce that had quite a kick to it . just so you know . but these are minor caveats . this is a five-star place . 
i had both the chicken and the pork ribs and both were delicious , although i think that chicken was my favorite by far . also had their flan , which was pretty amazing . this is an excellent choice for the price . 
i went here two years ago and thought it was sublime . i don ' t know what ' s happened in the intervening time , but i went again this week and it was awful . the service is wretched N minutes for stale pita and N hour to get our water filled ( for N an entree people deserve warm bread ) . at one point the waiters put down two of our meals , only to realize they had made a mistake and retrieve them to bring to another table ! when the food did arrive it was lousy . my chicken was gamey and my daughter ' s falafal was so dry so barely touched it . the decor is lovely it ' s too bad you can ' t eat the lamps . stay away
one of my favorite places in burlington . other than large crowds , lots of noise , and the apparent inability to split up checks for large parties ( come on , how hard can it be ? ! ) , this place is the bomb . the most incredible pizza with the most incredible local ingredients . 
i had high expectations for this place . i love noodle soups but i don ' t think i even finished half of mine . i got their signature ramen that everyone gets , but i guess my tastebuds aren ' t catered to this type of soup . the broth is definitely flavorful but was a little too fatty and greasy for me . i like mine more clear and i just felt really heavy after several sips . the noodles were too thin and could have been cooked a little longer . they didn ' t taste homemade to me . for the price , i would have wanted a bigger bowl , filled with more meat and vegetables . a noodle soup should leave you feeling pleasantly full without the guilt you get after a big meal . i felt like i got the nutritional value of a fatty steak without the filling substance and satisfaction . sigh . 
after the meal i had there this afternoon , i ' ve fallen in love with de mole . my mom and i took a trip out to sunnyside for our first saturday lunch date of N . the restaurant is small , but they ' ve done a lot with the little space they have . i think they succeeded in making it very modern , and cozy . we were seated promptly , and started looking over the menu . we ordered the guacamole , since the majority of people who ' ve yelped it have said not to pass it up . and they were right ! it was full of cilantro and diced tomato , and the chips were on point as well . great start to our meal . we also ordered the scallop ceviche . it should be noted that the scallops are diced , not whole . when it first came , i found myself poking at it with my fork , expecting to find whole scallops underneath . still , the scallops were extremely fresh and i really enjoyed my first taste of mexican ceviche . i ' ve never had ceviche with bits of avocado in it , and my mom and i devoured it . i must say that both appetizers get extra props for their very attractive presentation . after all , you eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth . i considered ordering the enchiladas verde con pollo , especially when i saw others around me digging into their own orders . but , i came to try the mole and thought i should stick to that and order what the restaurant is known for . it is their namesake after all . i ordered the skirt steak mole , a special . it arrived looking just as it did in the photos posted on yelp . and it was amazing . i don ' t think i spoke more than a few words while i ate because i was too busy stuffing my face with the perfectly prepared steak and delicious mole sauce . even after we ' d left , and i was walking to the subway , i was driving my mom crazy repeating " i really enjoyed my mole ! " . we ended off our meal by sharing the tres leches . it tasted like it was flavored with liqueur and topped with bananas and whipped cream . sweet way to end off an awesome meal . if i owned a restaurant , i ' d want it to be like de mole ---- intimate and cozy , and serving up delicious and beautifully presented food that brightens the spirits , fills the tummy and is easy on the wallet . 
i luv barbs ! the pizza is delicious , the arugula is my favorite topping . i feel totally comfortable sitting at the bar alone with a glass of wine and enjoying my pizza . the staff is cool and very attentive . my favorite place to be on a weeknight . i do wish they had a better happy hour ! 
food was perfect , reasonable and fast . if you can get over waiting to be seated , it ' s worth it . 
the food , the decor and the people are wonderful . this place is way to fanastic for such a small space , which make the wait tremendous depending on the day and time you go . 
okay , i am guilty to say i am a regular here ! this is my place for my fix for steamed lobster and the deep fried crustaceans of the sea . this is not the place for a gourmet experience . this joint is for the average joe , families , and laid back good times with friends . the ambiance here gives you the fake illusion that you are sitting by the docks enjoying a water view . wood stumps from the dock , rope , mounted fish statues , signs that say fisherman and the lobster tank are the decor of this joint . the bar area is always happening . the mister and i eat at the bar when there is too much of a long wait for a table . bartenders are attentive and take down your food orders quickly . you have to mind the dj who mixes the N ' s and today ' s music together . there is a long wait on the usual friday nights and weekends . they participate during restaurant week and have a summer N course meal for N . N . this is what draws the crowds . our favs are the raw oysters , steam lobsters , and the deep fried seafood chowder pot platter with whole belly clams . wait service is friendly and attentive ! 
the take out was great . we ordered the mozzarella di bufala and chicken parm , both were delicious and the packaging for delivery worked well - the mozzarella basil tomato stayed in place . definitely will be ordering again . 
went here for a late valentines dinner the monday after valentines day this year . we sat downstairs right by the window . very warm and cozy place . we started off with a cheese plate and then split four tappas . the food was delicious . i ' m not a wine drinking so i didn ' t order any , but my girlfriend said they paired the wine very well with the food . the stuffed calamari and turkish beef dumplings were amazing . desert was delicious . the waiter brought me out a glass of warm mulled wine . i ' m not a wine drinking but it was paired with the desert i got . i ' ve never had food with wine that is paired together . it really does work . the wine was delicious . was one of my favorite dates , very intimate and very relaxed . we were there for N N N hours ! the waiters didnt rush and made the meal an event . 
gladly waited in line for N minutes . got one artichoke , one crab , and lots of grease . at Nam it was exactly what i needed . my favorite specialty slice in the city to date . also , i don ' t usually do this , but the lot of negative reviews on here are silly . they seem to complain about some combination of the line , the fact that the workers don ' t want to be their best friends , or the fact that specialty pizzas often times bear closer resemblance to their specialty rather than to actual pizza . to you i say lo N ) you probably don ' t have anywhere else to be , N ) loosen up and enjoy how unhealthy the fun unconventional toppings are , and N ) stop blaming your insecurities on the pizza guy . i mean there ' s Noz beers . 
comment to the owner gavin my family and i were vacationing in new york at the time and i actually talked them into going to dark horse for lunch . i thought the ambience of the restaurant was great . we went on saturday december N , N at about Npm . the restaurant was N N empty at the time . after the fact , we went to another irish pub in time square and it was fantastic . what really made our experience at your restaurant horrible was the waiter . i don ' t think your customers and guests should be treated as though they are eating for free and that your employees are doing the customers a favor . i ' m sorry but , bad for business . waiter had a heavy accent , didn ' t catch his name . bus boy was very nice . 
this place is aight . i came here with my buddies , and waited about an hour to get seats . we ordered one of their combo yakitori plates , which was big enough to share for N people to get a sampling of yakitori . we also ordered an okonomiyaki , which was kind of small and served in a cast iron , almost like a deep dish pizza--except it was kind of on the soggy side . i don ' t know if it was just ours , but i didn ' t enjoy eating it . we also ordered some takoyaki , which were not bad , but there wasn ' t enough seasoning ( very sparse on the bonito flakes ) . i ' ve had better takoyaki before , so this definitely isn ' t their signature dish . we also ordered some onigiri which were pretty standard -- it ' s hard up to mess up on that , right ? ? ? that night it was pretty busy , and they seemed to be understaffed , so service was pretty lacking . if the service was a little bit better , then i ' d give my rating a N stars . . . but seriously , there are better places to have takoyaki--just go to st . mark ' s . 
my january N , N lunch at tia pol the idea of having a business lunch at tia pol sounded exciting tapas , wine , good conversation . the problem wasn ' t with the food . it was the server behind the bar whose hairy butt was exposed every time he reached for something above the bar . ( emphasis on the hairy . . . ) good tapas ! bad ass . . . . can ' t seem to separate the image . al paradise
i don ' t think that amazing . . . . but the broth is very authentic . . . feels like it ' s from hoshu island . i am not a big fan of ramen in general , and this one is nothing in particular . . . . the soup is what makes it worth it . i like the decor though , and location is convenient . . . . a good post dinner or post volleyball place . 
this place is incredible ! the food is tastier than most indian restaurants and cheaper too ! i bought a couple trays of samosas , butter chicken etc . for a party and the people loved it ! the staff is obliging and the service is quick and efficient . when i order meat it is also cut cleanly and well packed . will definitely be returning ! 
a year ago i left n libs and my request was i must live walking distances to a paesano ' s . . . . hence my current location . although it moved N N a block farther from mi casa to a new location , it ' s ok b c a typical paesano sandwich probably clocks in at N calories and the extra N steps should but a healthy dent into my N calorie meal . . . yep i eat N . the usual suspects are there paesano , daddy wad arista . . and my new addition to my food harem . . . ms . liveracce- crispy chicken livers w salami , gorgonzola and a tangy sauce . the other sandwiches are decent too but the N of these sandbitches are part of my regular rotation . i would eat here everyday if that would not lead me to rocking a cup size of a hooter ' s waitress . 
i went to this place yesterday for bunch and loved it . the only downside to it is that it is very small . i had the french toast with apple compote and my friend had an omelet with goat cheese and french fries , we both loved our dishes ! the staff was friendly and nice . cash only . i would go back here again . i think we spent about N on the food , tip and tax , we did not order drinks . 
so i went to le virtu with N friends on tuesday night . . . . . . lets just say that craig lebain was so off with his N bells , they maybe deserved N . the service started off great . the waiter , whose name i can ' t remember , something foreign , started off with a few wine recommendations . we ordered a white and a red to start off . he asked if we just wanted the white to start off with and we said no , please bring both to start . he poured the white wine and said that he was going to start with the white for the apps and bring the red for the second course , we had ordered N courses . we said that we really wanted it now and it would be great if he could bring it . he wondered off and walked around doing nothing . later he walked by our table and saw that our white wine glasses were empty and realized he still forgot the red . great job buddy . the food was ok . we had the fried olives and polenta with sausage and peppers . the polenta was cold and the sausage was hard seemed like it was old , not tender or flavorful . we got N pastas for the next course . a papperdale and a agnolitti-both cold and uneventful . third course was fine the black ink pasta with seafood , pear salad and a very dry durado , with a balsamic on the zucinni that was so sour that we didn ' t eat it . the ramp pesto was the only thing that was good on the dish . needless to say we were finishing our wine after desert and the servers moved all of the tables around us and made so much noise we felt so uncomfortable that we took our wine glasses to the bar to finish them . never a thank you from the server for the N tip , or a greeting from the bartender , like maybe a " hello , how was your dinner ? " we are all N in the service industry so we get it and we were not there that long after our meal and the bar was full so we thought that it would be fine . well the bartender couldn ' t jerk our wine glasses away from us fast enough-i think maybe management should have a reevaluation of their staff-N bells doesn ' t mean you should float by with crappy service . i am just sayin . . . . . . . . . . i will not be back and i will tell all of my restaurant friends to stay clear ! 
i ordered an italian bomb pizza . it was good but the crust is super thin , can get soggy , and just not what i was expecting considering how hyped up it was . that was for take out , which is nice that they keep the eat in and take out parts separate so that it doesn ' t get too crowded in the eat in place . 
crepes were delicious ! i had the chicken asparagus crepe and the chicks was very nicely flavored . my fianc had the banana nutella crepe and loved it . the coffee had a nice taste as well . it is a cute restaurant and service was very fast . very close to the staten island ferry terminal . will like to visit again next time we are in town . 
loved this market , especially trader joes . many other great shops
one of the best burgers in the city . period
been here a number of times bN and it was superb - food and service , however after going back last night it will be our last . service was extremely slow and pizza was awful . to top it off they no longer validate parking . 
the owner of this diner is extremely nasty to his wait staff . i was there eating and saw the owner or manager treating the waitress so horribly . i was very surprised by this because she was an excellent server . never had to ask for refills on coffee , water , or soda . she was very helpful with the menu and the choices of what to eat . if u choose to go to this diner i suggest asking for april as your server . she is very helpful and gave us great service . if we return we will definitely be asking for her again . from what we saw this place is under new ownership and management . the food was very good . it was all fresh and tasted as such . the dessert ' s were amazing . the only problem we had was the treatment we saw of the wait staff . other than that i definitely recommend eating here . i will N be returning ! ! ! 
although we did have to go in the early evening because reservations were scarce , it was worth it because the food was so good . the special appetizer lobster and gnocchi , mussels , burger , minetta steak , and chocolate souffle are amazing . the restaurant itself is very small but i did not feel like i was sitting on top of other people , even with it being N full . 
this was a great spot for lunch in the east village . the menu is extensive and the items were ordered were very large and delicious . the place was very crowded but we weren ' t rushed at all by our server . we tried the bloody mary and bellini drink specials and both were excellent . i had a crispy goat cheese salad and it was very good . the others had an eggplant parm sandwich and one of their soups and both were very good too . this was actually our first meal in the east village so i ' m not sure how it compares to other places in the area but i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend cornerstone cafe . 
this place is great ! ! ! ! i love this place . i tried out the restaurant right when they opened and then again two times since . the food is awesome , inventive and creative . i even saw the chef on tuesday on nbc ' s the N show ! trying the shame burger is a must ! i have never had scrapple before and thought i would hate it but it was delicious ! the menu seems to change often and you never really know what to expect . it seems that they are only using the freshest ingredients that are in season , things like ramps ( spring leeks ) and fiddlehead ferns . . . . . the wine list is impressive and eclectic . . . . the prices are right too . finally , a list in the city where you can pick from N wines by the glass that are cool and interesting . . . . . . if you like craft beer , this is the place for you . . . . . N beers to choose from on draft , again , cool and interesting . they also had about N different bottles to choose from . try this place out . . . you will like it ! 
i work nearby and like to visit new restaurants and lunch spots in the area . i met my girlfriend here after work yesterday and we enjoyed making ourselves pretty much what was a buffet of appetizers and salads , they were all very good . she really enjoyed the cocktails and i enjoyed a few beers from italy , greece and an american ipa i hadn ' t heard of before . with very good food , friendly and quick service and a comfortable ambiance , i have no problem recommending this restaurant to anyone for pretty much any occasion . 
came here for restaurant week . cocktails are amazing . i had a mojito and it was delicious , with a real sugar cane stick , my friend had the tropical sangria which was also delicious . food was absolutely spectacular . get the domino for dessert ! ! atmosphere is very pleasant , we also had a very pleasant waiter ! all in all , loved it . 
way overpriced for mexican food . the overstuffed burritos are great , but too much money . a lot of university students and locals go here , so it ' s a nice mix of people . the tables are close enough that you can hear your neighbor ' s conversation . try to get a table at the front window for privacy . worth going to at least once . 
the best brunch in the city ! nothing is better than the cacio e pepe eggs . they are light and fluffy almost like an oatmeal consistency with a great peppery flavor . the potato skin sides are equally delicious and sprinkled with parmesan . however , the real standout here is the service . i went for brunch yesterday and my friend got carsick from a bumpy cab ride . she couldn ' t eat her meal at all . the waitress kindly brought her homemade ginger ale and bent over backwards to help my friend feel better . unfortunately we had to end the meal quickly . shockingly , they didn ' t charge my friend for her meal or ginger ale . i was so impressed with this kind and unnecessary gesture . if the manager is reading this , the waitress ( whose name i wish i had gotten ) is a true gem . i will certainly be back . 
good pizza and good service . i would have rated them better if they had a better crowd ! 
the food was soooo good . the staff sooooo bad . the staff was huddled and louder than the clients . attitude from the hostess and the bartenders , which both messed up our seats and drinks , and still gave me the attitude . ahhh . what a shame . usually it ' s the other way around . anyway , if you want good food with a group of assholes working for you . go here ! what ' s going on with ny service ? 
these are the most horrible smelling dumplings but they get N stars for deliciousness . 
great place for mexican if you ' re in the area . beware of the habanero sauce ! it ' s flaming hot ! but tasty nonetheless . the rice can be dry at times , but i recommend getting it with steak . the steak is juicy and tender filled with wonderful flavors ! 
stay away from this place . N . N veal parm , and they have the nerve to serve ground veal patties , not real veal . enough said . 
i ordered a shroom burger at shake shack an got a small patty on the ghetto potato bread you can buy at shoprite N for N . N . the burger itself was alright but man , this place is too expensive to be this bad
this place is yummmm-meeeeee it has a nice romantic vibe to the restaurant , except for the countless number of times you ' ll hear a table or four sing ( completely off tune , i may add ) the " happy birthday " song . ( i literally counted N times in my dining experience ) . i also came here to take my date ( now bf ) to celebrate his bday here but no belching of the happy birthday song from this table . i figure all the diners got their fair share of the happy birthday already . i ' m big on any tapas place , why ? . . . because of the variety , of course ! " they " do say variety is the spice of life , and by " they " i have no idea to whom " they " are referring to . brussel sprouts are amazing here , but i ' m sure you ' ve read that already . the only other place i ' ve enjoyed the brussel sprouts as much is at cleo in hollywood , ca . i would recommend trying to get a seat upstairs for a more intimate dining experience with your dining companion . . . . ( all the big loud birthday parties are usually at the tables on the first floor ) unless of course you are looking to be one of the big loud birthday parties . they only take cash here , so be prepared . also , best not to get too tipsy here , i accidentally did the math wrong and ended up tipping N in cash ( the drinks are pretty strong here ) . ouch . . . now i know why they call it " tipsy " ! 
soooooooooooo . . . . . . . . . . delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! exactly szechuan food ! ! ! ( N ) 
note before i even start i want to forewarn you that this restaurant only takes cash . we were not prepared for that and were embarrassed as we scraped up enough bills and change to pay for our meal . we ' d heard good things about tartine and loved the fact that it was byob . the hostess was nice enough to recommend two nearby liquor stores and remembered us when we returned despite the line that had formed and seated us immediately . we loved the atmosphere and generally had a great evening . however , the food was disappointing . the evening started out on a high note with one of the special appetizers goat cheese and prosciutto stuffed figs . delicious . but N minutes after we ordered the waitress returned to inform me that they had run out of the entree i ordered . between the two of us we ended up with a special codfish dish and the steak au poivre , and frankly , neither had any flavor . the steak was a small cut of meat not particularly flavorful nor well seasoned . the codfish and accompanying vegetables had no flavor . we moved on to dessert and after a few bites , decided we weren ' t impressed with that either . the best things of the night were the appetizer and bread and butter ( we both remarked at how outstanding the butter was ) ! service was mediocre , food was mediocre , but the atmosphere was so enjoyable ( packed on a tuesday night ) , that we ' d probably go back for an appetizer or try it for brunch . 
omb . . . yes , oh my buddha . . . this place is incredible ! it ' s all soup as far as i ' ve seen but it couldn ' t be more fresh . everything is done in-house and the flavor is out of this world . it ' s so cheap and if you can split one order for takeout among two people for a really cheap dinner . . . less than N sometimes . i highly reccomend this place ! 
i went to this new place in the neighborhood tonight and hoped to have a light meal and play pool . after the check the manager came out into the front and yelled at me in front of my friends and girlfriend for not giving enough tip . i went to the back with him to look at the bill and said ' yeah , we tipped N because the server was rude and aggressive for no reason . my friend ordered a burger and fries and when it came it had potato salad instead of fries . the server said we should have said we wanted fries when that was what we ordered . he walked away and came back and slammed ketchup on our table for no reason . ' this is what i explained to the manager about why we gave a N tip . he wanted more , so i tried to hand him more money , but he didn ' t like how i did it and slapped the money out of my hand . i tried to pick it back up to give it to him and he told me to leave the place and not come back . i said that was crazy and he backed down . i hope this whole thing wasn ' t because of my skin color . 
it was definately better . i enjoyed it last time , but the brunch wow ' d us . i never new they did brunch . apparently all new according to the waiter , but you ' d never know . i was impressed . so were my N kids who loved the chocolate fondue fountain and of course their eggs and bagels Nst . i loved the omlet station and the fruit . . . love the strawberries very fresh . great brunch ! ! coming east sunday . 
it has been a long time not to eat sandwich with the sauce all over my face . it is just too good to eat slow . i had the grill spanish mackerel today . the fish is fresh . i love the combo taste of the pink mayo sauce mixed with the fresh cilantro , skimpy thin slice of cucumber and a generous heap of shredded pickled carrot . the bun is crunchy , not too hard . the grilled butter wrap all bites heavenly . next time i will try eating in and sit on the low chair . 
it ' s a surprise to me that this place gets such stellar reviews . . . perhaps that ' s merely a testament to the general state of ramen depravity in prospect heights . the pork bun appetizers are five bucks a pop . originally i was thinking hoping that a serving would come with N buns . the pork bun was solid but nowhere near the fatty melt-in-your-mouthiness that other ramen restaurants ( ahem , ippudo ) deliver . the kale salad was a potent combination of crunchiness and saltiness and by far my favorite part of the meal . as for the ramen . . . the portions are definitely on the smaller side , so for twelve bucks you may feel a bit cheated . the quality of the pork and other toppings was average at best . you only get two thin slices of pork with the default settings . the broth , in my humble opinion , was the most notable misstep it didn ' t have a lot of flavor or garlic or pork globules or depth . it also contained one ingredient that seemed out of place in ramen , but i just couldn ' t put my finger on what it was . for once in a long , long time i left a ramen bowl half-uneaten . definitely don ' t trouble yourself to travel to brooklyn just for this ramen , but if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you ' re dying for a hot soupy noodle infusion , this place may do the trick . 
great fresh bagels , delicious and inventive cream cheese . donates to local organizations . 
oh my this spot is off the charts good . first time walking in can be a bit confusing , the place is so tiny , what looks like an upstairs balcony is seating for very small people with just a few tables . you ' ll be able to see and hear every conversation from all the nearby tables , caution to those patrons anywhere close to six feet , you will hit your head . i ' m not sure how this place passes inspection , the inspectors must get fed first before they take their clipboards out , but please don ' t ever change it ' s way too unique . it is jamaican cuisine and it is brooklyn , so expect slower service then normal , don ' t show up too too hungry they ' re on caribbean time . byob , or order some homemade sorrel , by the time the very nice waitress climbs the N degree metal stairs with your jerk dish you ' ll forget all about the wait and be transported to the beaches of jamaica . get their early before they run out of their popular curried goat , the oxtail is amazing , rice peas just right , jerk leg of lamb mouth watering . try it during a week night when it ' s not packed with hipsters and weekend food whores alike . 
i like this bar alot . it ' s growing on me . my girlfriend loves it way more than i do . i went here because of her . for now , the standing is okay in my book . greats about it are the two bars in here . the main one up front and the second tucked in the back nook . bartenders are super chill and friendly here . i had the pisco sours on a number of occassions , all were solid and tasty . i haven ' t really gone for the full dinner , but have gotten the bong smoked oysters and other orders of ceviche . everything tasted fresh . nothing seemed off and unusual in flavor . i would need to return for an actual dinner to rate the full experience . so far , this is definitely a great spot to grab drinks with your friends and enjoy some lighter fare for a pre-dinner or during after dinner drinks . 
a very nice , friendly and exclusive restaurant , definitely worth the trip down to the south of manhattan . the food was very good and had nice presentation . the service staff really worked hard to give you a top service experience and they succeeded . the sommelier was very good and had a humble approach in a positive way . the wine list was really nice . i rate it N out of N . ( N N ) if you wanna experience a perfect love couple dinner this is the place . 
the food are excellent . the service very professional . but we saw a segregation of people by etnicity , and this is very bad . 
their shakes are good but the service sucks . they are so stingy with napkins ! it ' s like they cut their own trees in the back and make them there or something ! their steak empanadas are horrible . i ' m colombian so maybe my standards for empanadas are a bit higher but god . . . . they are not what they used to be . i remember the first banana king on Nst ave in paterson back when i was like N years old . it was awesome ! i still like their pinchos and their chicken arepas . their salchipapa . but the bu uelos are too big for my taste . . . and the pan the quesos are often over cooked . the empanadas taste like they have been there for days . sigh . . . 
food is great ! customer service ? not so much . they didn ' t even have the decency of checking on my husband and me after they served food . wasn ' t asked for water once and not even if i wanted anything else . i would understand if it was busy , but it wasn ' t . meh . i ' ve experienced better . 
i really wanted to love this place , especially since the one in sf is great . let me start by saying that the service here is absolutely N stars . but the food . . . was so disappointing . to our surprise , the seasoning for all N dishes we had were way off . the foie gras was bland and the steak tartare was way over-spiced seasoned . . . also smelled tasted heavily of ketchup . the mussels were also so bland we had to ask for salt and tabasco . normally i love dipping crusty bread in the mussels sauce but it was as if the chef forgot the seasoning ! and the duck leg confit was also a bit dry and bland . i dunno , maybe it was an off night ? or new cooks ? i would come back for the wine and charcuterie cheese but probably not the prepared food . disappointing , to say the least . 
the place is great N for N drink specials are great but the staff is a huge mess from the managers to the servers and bartenders . i went on a weds eve . servers drinking at the bar and the bartenders serving them self drinks as well . i find it odd i was hit on by a man wearing a river walk t-shirt i assumed he was a bartender he was obsessed with the tv and the volume but rarely made a drink for anyone but himself . i came to find out that he was not a manager or bartender he is the owner . i overheard him comment on a guests breast and then a servers . this place is a frat house at best . i loved the food and the drinks N for N you can ' t beat it . i will keep myself and my breast away from this bar i am out for a good time but this place is a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen . i really felt bad for the waitress . 
besides the fact that these macarons are extremely expensive ( N per one ) , it is amazing . the blackcurrent and violet and gingerbread are the seasonal flavors and it was pretty good . the rose flavor macaron was good too . the only bad part is that is it too small and you will want to eat more and more of it . even though it is expensive , it is definitely worth a try and you will want to go back for more . 
i came here because of the very good reviews i read about it . a lot of the times you can ' t believe the hype , like that crappy restaurant avenue in long branch . this is in fact a very good place . sat outside and had a good seafood with pasta dinner . one of the better italian restaurants in nj i ' ve been too . byob is a major plus too . check it out if you ' re in the area . there was a bit of crowd and i had to wait even tho it was a random weekday night . i went back again and had the meat lasagna special . it was very good but i felt there wasn ' t enough , i ate it really quick . the gnocchi is also really good . one of the best gnocchi you ' ll ever get . great restaurant . 
yummy
a guy that looks like scotty j . from boogie nights ( aka phillip seymour hoffman ) with the short shorts and the blond hair and coke bottle glasses pulls up to give us our sandwiches . guy is friendly , pets my annoying ankle biting dogs and goes on his way . i sit down to take a bite out of my italian sandwich and everything in it was stale right down to the soggy tomatoes . my mother ordered the chicken sandwich and she got mostly bread and cheese . my dogs weren ' t too crazy about it either , i ' d give it one star if it weren ' t for scotty j . other than that it was pretty bad . 
ever since the rice noodle cart in front of the burnt down hong kong supermarket disappeared i ' ve been trying to find it ' s replacement . while waiting for poon kee ' s to take its sweet ass time to open , i ' ve managed to come across this cart through yelp and it is exactly what i was looking for . rice noodle ' s with sauce over fish balls . for N . N a pint it really gives you that feeling of satisfaction while still leaving your stomach room for more . protip the cart is in front of wing shoon ' s and the lady closes around Npm . 
great craft beer selection both at the bar and in the bottle shop . i live around the corner and have been catching flyers and phillies games at the bar . can ' t wait until the upstairs is open . 
i didn ' t get the pizza this time , but i ' m sure i ' ll be back for a second visit . for rittenhouse , the prices are very reasonable . our party of N ate for what you would typically pay for a party of N in the neighboring restaurants . we came here for brunch and it ' s nice to see more than sausage , eggs , and toast on the brunch menu . brunch entrees come with a coffee and your choice of a mimosa or bloody mary . service was decent and our food came out fairly quickly . i ordered the gorgonzola burger , which came with a side of greens and potatoes . it was flavorful and well balanced . our server forgot to refill my water , but other than that , everything was great . 
came here with some friends ! had an enjoyable meal ! the sag paneer was delicious ! good tandoori chicken as well ! we all loved our food ! 
very good
very enjoyable evening . i hightly recommend the appetizer platter to share . parking is in the rear or on the street , but a lovely neighborhood . great food . 
upon the glowing recommendations of a trusted friend , i sought them out . there were two carts on opposite corners but they had the exact same sign so i figured either was probably ok . i wasn ' t feeling terribly hungry so i decided on the falafel plate--meat just seemed kind of heavy at that moment . i kind of regretted it , though , because the falafel were not really hot i think they ' d been sitting around a little while , but the flavor was good . accompanied by the sauces , rice , and salad , which were all great and in generous portions , it ended up being the best bargain i had in ny ! 
this has been hands down one of my worst dining experiences in park slope . i ' ve been here N times . the first two times the food was thoroughly mediocre and the price was pretty high . the last time , the food was just awful , including the salad . imho it ' s pretty hard to make a bad salad , but blue ribbon managed it . i kept going back because this place always gets great reviews and some of my friends like to go , but after my last experience , i ' m never going again . not only was the food bad but the service was slow . they brought out cold food intermittently , didn ' t want to answer basic questions about meals ( my gf has a nut allergy and trying to find out if a dish had nuts in it was painful ) , and took forever . ( the bus boy filling up water glasses was great though ) . i had the hanger steak and it was awful . started with a goat cheese salad which not only was terrible , but the portion was ludicrously small . there were literally N small lettuce leafs on the plate . my gf had some kind of pepper shrimp appetizer that she ate as an entree and even though it was small , she didn ' t bother finishing it . 
great foods , good cocktails , professional service and decent wine list . what not to loved ? the price is why i gave it four stars . 
there ' s no good reason you haven ' t been here yet . cantina is that spot no matter what season it is . most people come here in the summer to sit in their huge outdoor area . i think they might sometimes allow small dogs but definitely not larger dogs . be prepared to wait for drinks . ( their bar is extremely small and i don ' t think you could fit more than N people back there to make drinks . ) it ' s like being in mexico . . . in south philly . ask for will , d , or mark if you ' re at the bar . they ' re the sh t . they have great margaritas and do awesome pitcher specials if you go for happy hour . i go here about once a month and i ' ve never had a bad experience . food is decent , may be a little overpriced . definitely almost spent N on a burrito recently . i wish the menu would change more frequently . tequila flights are serious ! get them ! drink the bloody mary type nonsense they give you . it ' s spicy but incredible . i have two complaints about this place . if you sit at the bar in the winter time you have to keep your jacket on because it ' s so damn cold . two , change the god damned jukebox ! ! ! ! ! ! lady gaga has been on there for over a year ! ! ! that is embarrassing ! ! ! and most of the other stuff sucks ! ! ! seriously ! change it immediately ! i ' d rather listen to morse code ! ! ! 
tom ' s is definitely not the best breakfast i have ever had , so why the N stars ? by far the best service i have ever encountered in any eating establishment . i took my two out of towners here for a late breakfast because it ' s within walking distance of my apartment ( yet another great reason to live in bedstuy ) . the line was scary . i had to be to work in two hours , and i wasn ' t sure if we would have enough time to wait , eat , and subway it to the west village . not only did we fit all that in , but we also had time to go to chelsea and hang out in highline park for awhile , that ' s how fast they are ! the line moves super fast , and your time in line is made better with the snacks they bring around-orange slices , chocolate chip cookies , piping hot sausage-all free . they pour you coffee in line too ! we were seated within minutes , checked up on the entire time we dined by various people , including i believe the owner . i felt like i was dining at home , but my mom never waits on me hand and foot like this . and the food ? great and super cheap . i had N eggs , grits , toast and sausage for N . N ! my friend declared it his favorite meal while in new york . i wouldn ' t go that far , but there is a reason they ' ve been voted best breakfast for N years in a row ! 
incredibly overpriced with rude employees . a homage to all things italian should be just that- not one flavor in a small gelato ( anyone who has ever set foot in italy and gotten gelato know that italians never limit you to one flavor , even in a small ) , not a N glass of wine ( the cheapest they offer ) , and certainly not staff that yells at you for dining at drinking your wine at a table with a friend that purchased their snack at another location within eataly ! yes , we ordered wine and cheese in la piazza , and our friend got a cappuccino and a pastry from the lavazzo area , and was yelled at for consuming his snack with us . . . . . in the same freaking store . this is americanized italian to the core . i am not saying the the quality or flavors are not good- they are just incredibly overpriced , even by nyc standards . you are better off getting your italian gear at chelsea market . 
they have cut down their portions a lot . they used to give you a ton of meat and rice now its almost not enough for a meal . hey halal guys that stuff cost like nothing pour it on
let me start by saying the lobster and shrimp pyramid pasta is the best dish i have had in recent memory . seriously outstanding . if you go , be prepared to wait . reservations are only accepted before N N . they ' ll take your cell phone and call you when your table is ready , so plan on a pre-dinner drink at valanni across the street , or tria down the block . also , parties of more than four are kind of obnoxious because the place is so small . byo and cash-only . service was cordial but not overly friendly . the tasting menu ( N for four courses ) , which i ' ve had before and comes with almost too much food , is only available to you if the whole table is also ordering it . we shared the antipasti app , which was big and full of portobello mushrooms , roasted peppers , marinated mozzarella balls , salami , olives and roasted tomatoes . for my entree , i had the arctic char special , served with parmesan new potatoes , grilled asparagus , and a micro greens salad with lump crab meat . it was excellent , though the fish could have been cooked a tad longer . i tried all the other dishes too , and everything was great , with portions that were much bigger than expected . the four of us shared the tiramisu , which was moist , flavorful and gone in N seconds . i ' m pretty close to claiming mercato as my favorite restaurant in philly , but there are still a few more to try . 
best tomato pie around - hands down . 
the best chinese and specifically szechuan food in town . super authentic from what i understand and really incredible . dan dan noodles are a great choice here , and ordering from the " wet " and " dry " sides makes sense , too . though you could blast yourself with super hot food all the way , try to pick a few dishes in the above six and a few below five to balance yourself out . they actually rate the the dishes based on spiciness too . byo is possible , and now they have a liquor license . 
i believe that with stella N trattoria , i have now found the perfect lunch experience in midtown manhattan . top notch service is matched by a contemporary menu , fresh and well prepared food , and unbelievable views ! even better , my office is just a few blocks away , so i am truly blessed to have the wonderful option so convenient to me . i particularly like their branzino , but everything i have ever ordered was spot on ! how cool to have such a great lunch experience in the middle of the macy ' s bedding lines department . unbeatable option . i really recommend this place for anything - salads , fish , sandwiches , you name it . 
for months i was supposed to make the trip here and i ' m mad at myself for not making it here much earlier . best fried chicken i ' ve had in quite awhile , and the bacon cheddar waffles were to die for . their lemon butter and herb butter is the perfect addition to the meal as well . definitely making frequent visits here in the future . 
i used to order from this place because they ' re one of the only non-pizza places that will deliver in new haven . no more . they are consistently rude on the phone , keep changing the delivery minimum ( sometimes N , sometimes N ) , and the curries are watery and tasteless . noodle dishes are so-so sometimes the noodles are fresh and sometimes rubbery and old . if you order something " spicy " they ' ll just throw chili flakes on top of it . then , the last time i ordered , the shrimp in my drunken noodles had gone bad--they had a strong rotten fishy smell that permeated all of the noodles ( which were rubbery ) . one bite and i threw it out--it was food poisoning waiting to happen . after reading haran t ' s review , i didn ' t really feel like getting in a fight with them over what constitutes bad shrimp , so i threw it out and swore to never order from them again . if you ' re in new haven , just walk or call a shuttle for take-away ( from anyplace else ! ) . 
it ' s not a bad steak , but it ' s just over-rated . there are better places for a steak to me . this one was too messy and it was only alright . i think jim ' s or john ' s roast pork are better options to me . 
good wine and food . small plates and great wine list . would definitely go back and recommend to my friends . 
i came to lombardi ' s one day by accident , a friend and i were looking for a place to eat and somehow stumbled onto lombardi ' s . i am a obsessed with pizza by the way and for years my fav was grimaldi ' s ( but then they sold it and now its not a solid five stars anymore ( ) anyway , strolled into lombardi ' s and ordered a pie with black oil cured olives and a little fresh garlic . . . when the pie came it looked delish ! the smell was unbelievable and then we tasted it and wow ! it was one of those hard to replicate moments . maybe it was that moment , that night , but my friend and i swear we made love to pizza that night ! it was awesome ! 
delicioso ! it is crowded , so definitely get reservations . it is byob , but they will treat you like family . there are only a handful of servers , so come with a tampered expectation of speed . however , it is so freaking worth it . the food is definitely fresh , the servers have an authentic accent ( a little hard to understand , but friendly ) , and they have a ton of specials . complimentary bruschetta at the beginning and cookies with limoncello at the end . authentic italian . 
great service , fabulous food . . . definitely a family regular stop ! 
i went there twice and both times were disappointing . first time , i ordered the signature item which is the fried dumplings ( N orders ) . when i brought it back to the office , i opened one of the containers . . . it was all burnt . . . black and i had to toss it away . second order was better but it was still not good b c it was hard and doughy . i went back to the restaurant today , to get a small chicken corn soup . . . it was just as nasty ! ! ! the soup was lumpy b c its was soooo starchy ! ! ! not sure if i will go back and try their food again ! ! ! ! 
my fianc and i enjoyed our meal here very much . i had the emmentaler sausage special , which was incredible , and she had the liptauer , which isn ' t really my thing but she enjoyed it . the decor and " feel " of the place are perfect . it ' s very small , the music is soft but noticeable , and the wait staff is extremely helpful and friendly . oh , and the chocolate cake for dessert was wonderful . 
by far my favorite ramen place in philadelphia . the noodles are perfection just the right texture and consistency . the broth is good too . it ' s a good , no-fuss ramen place . just plain good ramen . 
fun place to hang out after dinner . the dessert was delicious - we got the coconut pudding and the chocolate peanut butter bomb . would love to go back to try dinner ! 
went here with a group of five for dinner . they were very brisk about pulling together two small tables for us and getting everyone comfortable the host came back a little while later and was very concerned that i hadn ' t taken my coat off my shoulders -- i guess he ' d closed the door , then turned up the heat , but i still hadn ' t taken it off ( i ' m always cold ) . we started with an antipasti plate of cheeses , bread , house-roasted red peppers and a bowl of olive oil blessed with oregano . everything was excellent , especially the peppers . they also gave us a small metal container of grated parmesan with a hinged lid that called to my mind the visor on a medieval suit of armor ( cos i ' m a nerd like that ) , which some members of the party had perhaps too much fun playing with but that ' s okay . the parmesan was a great addition to everything from the bread to the peppers . a couple of us had the nightly special of pumpkin ravioli with a nutmeg-butter sauce . i felt like the pasta was just slightly tough but liked the nutmeg ( since you don ' t get it in savory dishes too frequently ) overall , more successful than not in my mind , though someone else who ' d ordered it wasn ' t really happy ( she ' d been expecting a cream sauce or something rather than just nutmeg and butter on top ) . another friend got the gnocchi with white sauce , of which i snuck a taste i liked the garlicky white sauce and the gnocchi were soft and well cooked , not doughy or tough . our waiter was slightly weird he seemed to fawn a bit and gave the other girls a weird vibe ( i was a bit out of this loop as i was sitting with my back generally to the room , and thus to him , but he was having a hard time grasping when pouring from our bottle of wine that all i needed was enough for a toast , i . e . a sip ' s worth , since i was not drinking . ) overall , la fourno is a good choice for italian in a warm setting . mangia bene ! 
good dog has the best burgers . i typically get the veggie burger which is amazing . the mix of sweet potato fries with regular is the perfect combo . my fiance got the traditional burger and he said it was outstanding and super juicy . this past time i got the fish tacos and they were a bit underwhelming . they were good , but i think i just had such a high expectation of them bc the veggie burger is so good . overall , if you are looking for some really good bar food def go here . the service and food is really good . 
fantastic nachos , cool vibe environment . i love it here- their nachos are worth traveling to . and their margaritas as sneaky at getting you druuuunk ! the oozing cheese and loads of generous toppings makes for a solid meal . 
huevos rancheros are divine . . . they get my highest praise ! delicious coffee . the bar counter seating where gas pumps once stood creates a most pleasant alfresco dining experience , somehow transforming the busy-ness of shelburne road . bravo ! 
everything that came out of this kitchen was better than anticipated . the falvors , textures and visiual appeal of mr forgione ' s creations will thrill you . the service is thoughtful , attentive and i felt i actually got sincere answers to all my menu questions . the waiter even recommended a less expensive bottle of wine when i asked for some help with the lengthy and quirky wine list . really nice place to dine , thanks marc . 
a great cozy little place with a pleasant staff , yummy food and drinks . i ' ve had some delicious crepes here with my closest friends and family . i love that you get to pick exactly what you want in the crepes , whether it ' s for dessert or dinner . definitely a place i ' ll be revisiting . 
so today i went to raymond ' s . . . . . got a cobb salad for N dollars . . . . . . . it took N minutes . . . . . . . . . they told me they had a new cook . . . . . . . when i got this N dollar ! ! ! ! ! salad it was a N inch plate of lettuce and at first i couldn ' t even find the chicken . . . . . . . there was about N strands of chicken . . . . . . . i mean for that price i couldn ' t even get half a chicken breast ? ! i mean a skirt steak was only a dollar more than the salad . . . . . . then to top it all off the staff sucked they all stood around talking and could care less about their tables . . . . . funniest part of the whole meal was they sat us in a tight little corner table that i could barely fit in and when i moved the table out so i could breathe . . . . . the hostess actually came to my table and pushed it back in onto my stomach and said " it belongs like this " keep in mind the place was completely empty at the time this all happened . . . . . . . . . . in short that place sucked ! ! ! ! ! ! don ' t waste ur time or ur hard earned money ! ! ! ! ! ! it was comical
this may be my new favorite place in downtown . don ' t be fool this is not your average irish pub ! yeah sure you can get sheppard ' s pie and fish and chips but the chef uses ingredients that you would find in french , latin , italian and american dishes as well . braised short ribs , duck confit , rissotto sides dishes a pasta dish with chicken and a smoked gouda cream sauce . . . . . who would have thought ! ! i went with a steak special . N . N for a Noz steak smootherd with grilled onions and shallots and a sauce that i can ' t remember but it made my mouth water ! ! all in all i was so happy that we stopped in . we even splurged for dessert , the creme brulee . it was perfect ! ! nice and creamy with great orange flavor . all in all a great experience
i ' ve been here several times and have tried out the delicious tapas . but there ' s one dish that i can ' t get enough of - the half-chicken with red peppers . the peppers just creep up on you and gives the chicken a kick that ' s incredibly mouthwatering . i guaranteed if you were feeling tired , you would be fully awake after one bite of this entree . service was impeccable and the drink pairing recommendations were excellent . 
the theme of this entire meal was " looks good , but don ' t get your hopes up . " i can ' t believe i suffered through a night full of drunk med students to look forward to this . decor -- first impression really cute , old time-y , cozy . old pictures , wood paneling , cute old people everywhere ( ok , they ' re not really part of the decor , but . . . they kind of are , you know ? ) . love it ! just don ' t make the mistake of looking up . starting a foot below the ceiling , everything is straight up industrial - all crazy metal tubing and unfinished black insulation . it ' s like the decorators started out pumped about their project and then ran out of steam at the end , saying " f--k it , it ' s not like people look at anything but their plates anyway . " sad . food -- " canoe club cheeseburger . " not just any cheeseburger ( though you can get the regular bacon cheeseburger option , too ) , but a super duper special burger . peppers and onions in the patty , which is served on a soft bun with cheese , lettuce , tomato , and tarragon mayo . sounds super tasty , looks super tasty , tastes super mediocre . i have never eaten a less memorable burger . thinking back , all i can remember is . . . grease . . . and . . . strangely crumbly meat . the peppers and onions added no flavor , and i ' m pretty sure the chefs forgot to season the meat . the mayo and cheese contributed less overall than you ' d expect -- mostly oil , not so much flavor . the burger came with choice of regular fries , sweet potato fries , or seasonal veggies . i , of course , got the regular fries , but decided to switch things up by having it with a side dish of garlic aioli ( N extra ) . mmm , garlic . the fries were crispy and well-seasoned ( you can see the herbs clinging to each fry ) , but honestly , tasted better with regular ol ' ketchup than the aioli , which , while tasty , really just made the whole meal that much richer greasier . i definitely came away feeling like i was coated with a thin layer of oil from head to toe . ugh . in a last ditch effort to my meal on a high note , i ordered a seasonal fruit crisp ( blueberries , peaches , apple ) . again , not as delicious as it looked . it was just hot fruit covered in granola . and it wasn ' t even sweetened ! i knew i should have just gotten the chocolate cake . damnit ! service -- very friendly and efficient waitress . super nice . not annoyingly solicitous or annoyingly negligent . i liked her . seems like this place could have been a posh-posh establishment back in the day , but has since been bastardized by local students and their families -- the clientele was a healthy mix of elegant , well-dressed older couples and hoodie-wearing , gum-snapping students . ahhh , progress . if only all of that progress had been good . unless the food here has always been this unmemorable . no wonder dartmouth kids escape to boston and ny whenever possible . 
if you have ridiculously horrible vision such as i do , you ' ll most likely go blind attempting to read the menu ( which is on the wall ) not crazy about ordering family style and definitely not crazy about the food . luckily i eat like a bird , but for those who actually spend money to eat like a king . prepare for the food poisoning of a lifetime . don ' t say i didn ' t warn you ! 
love this place ! great food , quick service , open late and cheap prices . what more could you ask for ? the ambiance isn ' t the best but the food makes up for it greatly . 
awesome place . hands down . brought in my family of N people and with just one person in kitchen and one person behind counter this place was on point . the grilled cheese sandwiches and presentations perfection . the gentleman behind the counter was friendly helpful and knew how to run the place . give him a raise ! ! all around N stars . food , ambiance , drink selection and more ! ! thank you ! 
i was excited about this new restaurant , but will continue to indulge in japanese cuisine elsewhere for now . the food was good , but too expensive relative to quality . this place also has a weird dining room layout . it looks cute at first sight , but the layout is not very practical . after finishing my meal , i had to wait about N minutes until they resolved an issue with charging the incorrect amount on my card . they could have offered free desert or a discount on the bill for the lengthy wait , but the staff did nothing . step it up hibino lic . 
i have been to walter foods twice the first time i left thinking its was the best meal i have ever had in williamsburg apart from peter luger ' s . last night the food was so mediocre the chewiest , rubbery steak and the service was so lacking in personality or interest it was just bad ! i guess this place is inconsistent which mean i won ' t be rushing back anytime soon ! 
bring back the chilaquilas ! please ! i ' ve always loved this place ! can ' t beat the cubano and the local beers on draft . do not order the fried mozz ! it was a puddle of tomato sauce with a little dollop of cheese and some bread to dip . what is that ? i do love the hummus and would suggest that for an appetizer instead . still a go-to place . i actually saw a server tell a couple that they couldn ' t have their starbucks coffee cups in there . still don ' t know how i feel about that one . . . 
when i say this is my favorite restaurant in the world , it ' s an understatement . i discovered this restaurant about N years ago . i was coming out of work and told a friend i wanted to go eat steak . so we took the train down to the soho area and walked over to cafe habana . at first i was like " what ? " ! ! i mean , we travelled so far and this place was really just a packed diner , hole in the wall type place . however , we sat down to eat and i swear the food just melted in my mouth . i also noticed that there was a long waiting line to get food . it was really unbelieable . anyway , i go here to get the corn as an appetizer and the skirt steak for dinner . the last time i went with a friend ( i go at least every N-N months ) i saw gabriel byrne ( from the usual suspects ) accross the street walking his dog . my friend who lives there said he lives in the neighborhood . every singles friend who i have brought to eat here has told me how great the food is ! 
finally , i had the chance to check out the famed frankford hall during mid-afternoon hours . i ' ve heard that this place is a nightmare during peak hours , so let that be my disclaimer for this write up . at any rate , don ' t let the unassuming exterior fool you--inside is a wealth of fun , libations , and food ! let ' s start with the games ! gotta love the jenga and ping pong . games that get better as you drink . the beer selection isn ' t the most varied selection--you ' ll see a lot of the usual suspects--but there are a few gems . the fact that the drafts are only available in half-liters or full-liters goes to show that the focus is more on quantity than quality . we recommend the spaten oktoberfest--it ' s robust , toasty , malty , with a bit of crisp fruit flavor for easy drinking , and has light carbonation . and how about about them sausages ! the perfect pairing to beer and well-made . meaty . juicy . casing you don ' t have to fight with , but stable . held in a soft roll that allows the sausage to be the star of the show . put some sauerkraut or red sausage on it to sour the flavor up a bit . and don ' t forget the curry mustard ( nice and grainy--a far cry from your average fast food yellow mustard ) . what i really love about frankford hall is the laidback atmosphere . seat yourself . grab your own beer , food , and games . come with friends , coworkers , or family . relax . loosen up ! there ' s indoor and outdoor seating and the outdoor seats are heated during cold months . N . N stars , but the atmosphere causes me to round up . 
i ' ve been here twice already and the food is always ' refreshingly ' good ! being that all the ingredients are local and organic , i can definitely taste the ' freshness ' that goes into all the meals i ' ve had here . . . . the very best being the tomato gazpacho soup and the brown rice with eggplant off the lunch prix fixe selection . 
i came here for brunch on a saturday with some friends . i made a reservation but the restaurant wasn ' t very full when we got there or when we left . also , i hadn ' t realized that the restaurant was connected to a hotel since their entrances are on different streets . we got the omelette with mushroom , pepper , and tomatoes , steak and eggs , the fried oyster roll , and the waffles with fruit . i tried a bit of the waffle and steak and they were decent . my entree was the omelette , which came with a side of arugula salad . the salad had a lot of onion in it , and while i like onions , it was a lot spicier than i ' d expect a salad to be because of it . the omelette also was made kind of like a roll with the egg on the outside and the vegetables on the inside . i ' ve never had my omelette this way , but it also made it harder to get an event amount of vegetable with every bite of the egg . 
average chinese buffet . . nothing too special ! . . just like most reviews about this i want to mention that not all food is labeled which is unsettling . . sushi however is really good . not all the sushi is labeled . not to many choices and staff wasn ' t very polite . all and all this place isn ' t the best option . i rather drive much father to a much better buffet . unless you don ' t care what your eating or your just in it for the sushi this is your place . . otherwise i wouldn ' t recommend this buffet . . entrance is nice . . it ' s got that going . . 
if i could give it zero stars i would . i guess the one star can be for the food . it was ok . waited N minutes for our waitress to come over and even welcome us . waited another N minutes for drinks , and we only had soda . then after N additional minutes we hadn ' t even gotten our appetizer . the waitress brought out free guacamole . waited N more minutes then she kept asking us if we wanted more chips . still no appetizer . we cancelled it . N minutes later our entree comes . we eat it . we see a cockroach crawling down the wall . the waitress brings free dessert . finally the check comes and the appetizer we never got was on the bill . needless to say it was a miserable experience . 
just moved to the area and my wife and i went to sakura with a few friends . our reservation was N Non saturday and we were sat as soon as we got there . food was great from the shanghai wonton soup to the pork juicy buns to the angry dragon to the deliciousgreen tea mochi ice cream . we had great service . everyone in our party loves the juicy buns and raved about sakuramandarin . highly recommended and will be back again soon . also we got a lot of food for not a lot of money and also a byob . 
good thin crust . crazy lines . i would go during the afternoon on a weekday or take it as take out . 
sakagura was good . but not great . gochi in the bay are is better than sakagura . the location is cool and pretty hidden ( just walk through the parking arage ) as for dishes , the fluke and duck were the best dishes . the cold duck wrapped around scallions were amzing and extremely memorable ( a must try ) . 
this is really good pizza . comparatively expensive but delivery was very fast . i ate N Nth at once . 
we ' ve been going to mr . sushi for over N years , and have not been disappointed yet . the people are always warm and welcoming , and the food is wonderful . i ' ve been spoiled . 
so overrated . i do not understand the hype . 
i ordered the fish and chips and for it being N bucks , i was expecting it to be tasty ! but it wasn ' t . the fish wasn ' t crispy at all and the fries were soggy as hell ! why was my food so effin soggy when it took N minutes for my food to come out ? ? my person ordered the tuna burger and it came out cold . we are unsure if tuna burgers are supposed to be served cold or not . but the onion rings that were served with the burger was hideous ! it did not look good at all ( most naked onion rings i ' ve ever seen ) and of course it tasted awful ! there was no freaking batter on the onions at all . you were pretty much eating oily onions . okay okay , i lied . there were random batter crumbs here and there . i will probably give this place another go , but i ' m going to try their all you can eat crabs for N ( during N-Npm only ) . 
my co-worker and i came here before a meeting . the sandwiches were solid and not too expensive . if i ' m in the area i would do it again but i wouldn ' t make a trip out to dayton for these sandwiches . 
great place with lots of varieties . i highly recommend it . 
service is not a strong point . the food was ok . my meal arrived , and within two minutes my server checked to see how everything was . he then disappeared for N minutes . when he came back to offer me dessert ( hello ? empty glass ? ) , i asked for the check . the check came in N minutes . after my charge card sat there for N minutes waiting , i finally dug for the cash to cover the bill . i had the amount exactly , put down the money , and left . i know the server probably copped ( another ) attitude about the way that single diners tip . i get it . this isn ' t typically my approach , but i had no other options . 
pizza was aight , at best . greasy ( they pour olive oil on the pie before tossing it in the oven ) and too thick for my liking . my real problem , though , was that it took me N attempts before i found the place open . each time i went ( all during normal peak business hours ) , the guys were in there , hanging out , drinking beer , but said they were going to open " later . " " when ? " i asked . " few hours maybe . " each time i walked away disgruntled . that arrogance really turned me off . when i finally happened by when they were open , i waited on line for N minutes and ordered an artichoke slice . " we don ' t have that one today . just plain . " it ' s obvious that they ' re riding on the hype and being super lazy with the business , and i hope that it bites them in the ass when the hype dies down , which it inevitably will . blah . . . 
this place makes great sandwiches and i got some really good gelato . had the pistachio and it was delicious . 
my boyfriend and i came in for brunch soon after the bsbh opened . i ordered the quinoa salad , which was pretty good , but the portion size was smaller than i expected for a N vegetarian salad . however , what made our experience two star was the service . our waiter didn ' t seem to know the menu , was scattered , and not terribly personable . we attributed the mediocre service to the staff still getting settled , but weren ' t particularly excited to give it another try . this past friday , we were looking for a casual place for dinner , and decided to give bsbh another chance . afterall , it ' s in a great location , and has a serious beer selection , and outdoor seating . our first strange interaction was with the host . we requested a table by the open windows , so we could feel like we were outside , but avoid the impending rain . the host was silent for a good N seconds--staring at us , at the table chart , at the tables we asked for . finally , he grabbed menus and we followed him to the section . immediately , we could tell he was going to put us at the table closest to the kitchen and bathroom , despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty . we quickly asked if we could take a different table . this request was met by yet another ( extremely awkward ) N seconds of silence and staring before he put our menus down and allowed us to sit . finally seated , the waitress came over immediately and asked us for our drink order , clearly before we had a chance to look at the menu . we asked for another minute to read over the extensive beer list . N seconds later , she showed back up , asking for our drink and food order . we inquired about specials , to which she replied that she ' s not used to saying them , because people always read them for themselves on the chalkboard ( we had our backs to said board ) , which made us feel a little stupid . we ordered the veggie burger and the chicken sandwich . both were edible , but not great . the veggie burger came in a pita , and was probably the size of two standard patties , which was slightly unappetizing . the chicken sandwhich had so much cheese on it , you could barely taste anything else . the best part of the meal was the rejuvenation beer cocktail ( hefeweizen , rye , lavender syrup , lemon juice ) . overall , bsbh is disappointing . we might come back here for a drink , but would definitely sit at the bar . 
little food a lot of money , to me not a traditional mexican restaurant , more like a shi-shi restaurant , sorry
came in here by accident a couple of sundays ago when we couldn ' t get served at that pretentious german beer garden bar across the road . we had an absolute ball in here . the locals were friendly , the barman jeff was awesome with great music and the drinks were ridiculously cheap . forget what it looks like outside and go on in . . . . you will have a lot of fun . 
to danielle j , the person who previously reviewed our establishment . we appreciate you stopping by and we will take into consideration what you mentioned about your visit . in regards to price , our average ticket pp after happy hour is N , which falls at the low end of the medium price range according to zagat . secondly in response to the mostly asian crowd , that is the theme of our bar . thanks for spending your time giving us your thoughts . we have a great hh menu which has lower prices until Npm daily . 
had the seafood bisque soup that came along with half a caprese sandwich , bread , and an apple . it was all delicious . the soup is so good . one star off only because they close way early . i grabbed the soup and headed to the nearest starbucks to sit and enjoy . 
great food and fantastic atmosphere . keep your eyes peeled for the chicken liver sandwich with baked chicken skins . it ' s like the chicken version of bacon . 
ok , so the place is not the best look one around , but here is the deal . i have eaten at almost all the stalls and you just cannot go worry at this place . the food is amazing and cheap forget the high priced indian restaurants in the area give this place a try and keep an open mind . 
wonderful dinner on a quiet saturday night . calamari was best ever ! veal chop delicious , as was the sushi grade tuna , grilled to perfection . our server , gina was a delight . we were told that end of july , beginning of august is slow , so we enjoyed a quiet and enjoyable evening . 
this place is no beauty from the outside . my friend and i walked in and were immediately greeted and seated and served water . it seems like more of a take out place as for the duration of our meal we were the only ones in the restaurant ! the food was excellent however . i had the beef dumplings and sha momo ( i think ! ) . the broth was delicious and all ingredients tasted very fresh . although the restaurant is a sit down and waiter service it was very casual . our waiter was excellent , bringing my friend a fork without condensation and running to get me a new pair of chopsticks when he saw mine had fallen . i liked it a lot ! 
this is a really great joint ! it ' s the perfect place for everyone i know to meet in the city because of it ' s location . great cocktails , ( the bloody mary is awesome ) . the food is outstanding , they make a cheese stuffed jalape o roasted chicken dish that is insanely good ! very friendly staff . 
pompei is my favorite pizza in bayonne . i grew up on new york pizza and when i moved to new jersey it failed to compare for the most part . i will say that north bergen has a few really good spots but pompei brought me back to my youth and never fails to satisfy ! they have to be doing something right as they recently celebrated N years open . that is something to brag about now days . the crew behind the counter are awesome too . when you are in bayonne you have to check them out . 
we had breakfast at katz ' s this am . this was my first time going for breakfast , and can only hope it was just an off day for the kitchen . for not being busy , to see food coming out of the kitchen that was lukewarm was not a good first impression . i ordered the side dish of cheese blintz , they were good . the pastrami special omelet was tasty , half was hot , half not so hot . home fries were the same . the grilled vegetable melt , also not hot . i think i ' ll stick with katz ' s for lunch next time . 
the tavern is great , but it suffers from what i consider to be a bar a few sizes too small . however , the food is great and the ambience has a distinctive " yardley-like " feel , even more so now after the remodeling . burgers and wings are a must here . 
best mexican in philly , wow ! and tequila mojitos are amazing ! 
excellent restaurant ! the food and service were great . i really enjoyed the eggplant angliotti and the fig dessert . our waitress for the evening was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu . would highly recommend this place ) 
recently my boyfriend and i headed to nyc for a weekend to celebrate my birthday . i was really in the mood for some good ( and not too expensive ! ) italian food . we were seeing a matinee of a show that day and wanted to stick fairly close to the theater so we did some research and made a reservation at trattoria trecolori for after the show . i ' m so glad we did ! the restaurant and food were both wonderful ! the location was great ( right on Nth ) and close by which was good since it was so cold that day . the restaurant itself is very cute and cozy . . . . not too loud or overcrowded . we got to the restaurant about N minutes before our reservation since it was so cold outside figuring we would just wait , but the hostess took us right away and gave us a cute little corner table . it was very cozy and not cramped at all . the food itself was delicious . our waiter was very friendly and helpful but was not pushy when we didn ' t want to order the special of the night . our food came very quickly which made me a little bit concerned that they would try to rush us out but this was not the case at all . our food was just prepared quickly that ' s all . i got the chicken parm and my boyfriend got the veal sorrentino and we both loved our meals ! my chicken parm was delicious and well-cooked and the marinara sauce was so yummy ! and for only N . best of all , we decided to get a dessert ( ricotta creme cheesecake-highly recommend it ) and happen to just mention it was my birthday . next thing i know they ' re bringing me a cheesecake with a candle in and the entire wait staff sang me " happy birthday " . it was a real surprise and very nice . also they did not rush us to pay our check and get out and let us enjoy our food which was very pleasant . overall , i was very impressed with this restaurant . lovely atmosphere , authentic delicious italian food at an affordable price , friendly staff , what more could you want ? i will most certainly be visiting here again next time i " m in nyc . 
a great experience . the line was quick , the service and hospitality were top notch and the pizzas were delicious ! we ordered a margharita and special pizza N . both were excellent ! we ' ll definitely be back . . . 
i grabbed a take-out pie from last night ' s soft opening and came away impressed . first off the seating has been thinned out since it was " grimaldi ' s " with fewer tables leaving the smallish space less crowded . the pizza was an improvement over grimaldi ' s with a more noticable coal flavor , a better rise on the dough and a more flavorful sauce ( with a slight spiciness ) . the improvements came at a slightly higher price point with a large cheese going for around N about N more than at grimaldi ' s . juliana ' s is a great addition to dumbo , but wild rise at N jay street bar still makes my favorite pizza in the neighborood . 
best pho in the city , price is way cheaper than their competitors ! i always get the beef noodle special , come here probably one a week . 
i came to check it out because one of the owners is an old college buddy - wanted to love it but felt the many ways it could improve . the waitstaff was completely overwhelmed , and on a not-too-busy early sunday evening . took N minutes to get my order in with a waitress who had earlier claimed to be clocking out , but ended up becoming my nice-enough go-to when the other waiter blissfully ran by me N , N times . finally got my drink N minutes later . the jambalaya was not great - an ok flavor overall , but uneven temperatures throughout and way too many pieces of chicken and weird ( cold ) andouille sausage , and one tiny little shrimp . i would still be interested in trying some other dishes , but the flustered , though nice enough , service is enough to make me want to order take-out instead . 
this restaurant has excellent food , the service is always great , drinks are good , too . you can enjoy a great burger or an excellent steak ! 
i ' m keeping stars high for hollywood , but at times , it seems like they are starting to slip-up . they have great lunch specials for N . N . comes with bread butter , garlic bread and the entree . i usually get the baked ziti which i love but recently it was undercooked . i like pasta al dente , but this was needing a few more minutes in the pot to limber up a little bit . also , the pizza is great but recently we went and it was a little over-cooked . i know , undercooked , overcooked - they just have to hit the mark in the middle and they ' ll be back on top . overall , i still like the place , after all , nobody is perfect and they can ' t be great all the time . if they keep up the slide , though , so will my start rating . even then , give it a try - you may like it ! 
reposted from fathom page now that egg has its own yelp page . . . we went to fathom a few weeks ago and learned it ' s now the east girard gastropub ( egg ) . stollenwerk ' s co-owner recently purchased the restaurant so the menu is in transition as he works out the staple dishes and rotates in some seasonal dishes ( i got the sense from the waiter that legally they couldn ' t keep the old menu ) . the appetizers are mainly seafood dishes , but the entrees are a mix of choices ( hanger steak , bangers n ' mash , oyster po ' boy , vegetarian lasagna , and salmon are some of the current options ) . given the history of the area ( come on , fishtown ) and the lack of seafood places in the city , i hope the new owner keeps a good thing going with his own twist . i had the salmon with lentils and spinach , which was pretty good . my husband had the mussels ( an appetizer ) , which were tasty and if they had been put over pasta , could ' ve been made into a meal . overall , it ' s a good start and we will definitely look to return as the restaurant fully embraces its new identity . 
N stars all i have to say . food was delicious and the service was great . 
my son recommended this restaurant . he loves it . we were visiting from ou tof state . it was beautifully decorated , and the service was very good . my husband loved the salmon , and the other three of us ordered the mezze vegetarian platters . they were stunningly presented , in sections divided by nice lemon slices , and all of the choices in the platter were delicous . the red lentil soup was wonderful , and the baklava and halva for dessert was excellent . this was a wonderful ny experience ! 
i ' ve been extremely pleased with almost every single thing i ' ve ever gotten here ! very fresh ingredients , homemade soups , dangerously delicious cookies , and really friendly lady ( owner ? ) at the counter - she ' s as sweet as pie ! ! this place is a gem ! ! ! ! ! 
i ' d been to the other continental location a couple years back for late night drinks and food , and loved it . the continental midtown doesn ' t have as cool a vibe , but then again , i was there during their peak lunch hour . the food is good , but not great , and the menu ' s a bit limited . service on the slow side . but it is a more interesting place to hit up for lunch than the standard options , and with a few exceptions ( like the N lobster mac and cheese ) the prices are normal . 
i don ' t even know where to start . i guess the occasion i was here for lol . my team had hit their projection for the month of august we do dinners to celebrate our accomplishment . ) they decided to host out store dinner at blend over the water boy am i glad they did ! for starters the area is just beautiful ! parking isn ' t the easiest thing to find so we just opt out for the valet parking to save us the hassle . it was N which isn ' t bad . after giving our cars away to be parked we entered the restaurant . omg . the restaurant is stunning . the bar is fully equipped with anything your liver desires lmao . we were a big group so we couldn ' t get seated until everyone arrived . we had no problem . we all grabbed a drink at the bar in the meantime . waited until everyone arrived then were surprised by the fact that we got to sit in a private area of the restaurant . with a personalized menu congratulating us ! it was great ! we sat down were quicker tended to . everyone here is just so attentive . they would come periodically to ask if they can serve us with anything else . check if we were good on food drinks . unlike any other experience i had . our hostess was the best ! i ' m sad i didn ' t get her name . i felt overwhelmed for her . there were so many of us she handled it so gracefully . no mix us with our foods or drinks ! i was very impressed the manager , let ' s just say he has hook ups our store for now on lol . he was lovely . overall , this restaurant was truly a treat an experience i hope to enjoy again more often . oh the arepitas they give as appetizers . . . . to die for ! they took arepas to a whole new level ! the tostones " nachos " . . . . you just have to go try it for yourself . definitely won ' t regret it ! thanks , blend on the water team
great tacos ! ! have not had the burrito but have had every type of taco multiple times . one of the best tacos i had in philly . my only complaint is that after many repeat visits , i am starting to get tired of the menu and would like to see an expansion . how bout el pastor tacos or fish tacos ? ? ? 
great bar , great food , great service ! as a local i would suggest it to tourists and other locals alike ! keep up the good work elixir ! 
best food i ' ve had in a while . loved the decor and service was great . the mushroom ragout was remarkable as well as memorable . the burger was tender , juicy and bursting with flavor ! so excited to go back ! 
leunig ' s is in my top N all time restaurants . it ' s not an every week visit for me for N reasons , it ' s over N hours away and i am not a baller . however , when i am in vermont i make sure to set aside some extra cash and time to stop here . i adore french food when done this well . how could you not . the service is impeccable . the decor and ambiance transport you to paris . the use of local cheeses made my head spin . ( i am a cheese for dessert kind of girl ) . the cheese plate was perfectly constructed with contrasting flavors and textures . it ' s simply stated one of the most romantic restaurants i ' ve ever been to combined with such attention to detail and quality all around . i highly recommend for a special occasion or if you ' re a baller . . . a tuesday . 
hands down best slice of pizza in nyc , just wish i could go here more often , all the previous reviews say it for me , i don ' t think i have to say anything else . 
on first hearing that the prix fixe menu would be at the chef ' s discretion , we decided to order from the regular menu . the chef appeared and said he would consider our preferences , fish , in our case . the meal that emerged was outstanding and he presented us with signed copies of the choices he made for us - on terre a terre stationery . a wonderful keepsake for a memorabel meal . 
from the outside , the signage and setup looked intriguing . i was disappointed with the wine ( and selection ) . . the waitress was french speaking but seemed like she really had better things to do . . the biggest surprise were the crepes . . they were doughy , poorly seasoned and for anyone who have had good french crepes , i would suggest finding another place to spend your money . to be fair , we did not have the deserts that others rave about . 
i have worked at yale for N years , so have eaten at claire ' s many times over the years . i agree with the negative posts . the service is terrible and often rude . . . and claire , that includes you ! claire actually asked my daughter and her two small sons to leave because one of them was crying . shameful ! she should have made an effort to help . i will say that the cakes are good , and the soups are too . but the prices are outrageous , and certainly not worth the aggravation . 
checked out sanfords this sunday night for dinner and i just fell in love with the place . first , walking by the restaurant , you hear some music playing and it kind of gives off this exclusive feel - with the dark lighting inside and menu on pedestal on the outside . night was supposed to be casual , but the menu looked really good with alot of options . were seated immediately , waitress came over and got our order and brought a bowel with a variety of rolls and flatbread with butter . cutting to the chase - i ordered the death by mushrooms ravioli which consists of porcini , portabella and cremini mushrooms in a black truffle cream sauce - and it was the most amazing ravioli i have ever had . you do not need to be a fan of mushrooms , in fact , they just scare me most of the time , creeping me out - but this was so rich and flavorful ! my friend ordered the angus cheese burger and the first thing out of his mouth was mmmmmm ! ! ! he ordered some light beer from oregon which came in a medicinal looking bottle which he liked - and i ordered the chardonney - was good . all in all , i can ' t stop thinking about that ravioli and am so thinking of going there this wknd again . 
majority of rolls are very , very creative - not typical straightforward plain boring sushi ( though they have that too , if you ' re into that ) . my last two visits were disappointing , i finally figured out why most of the more creative rolls also feature some type of cooked meat seafood fish , or something tempura-ed . not showcasing a lot of raw fish . also , almost every roll is doused in some type of sauce ( spicy , eel , etc . ) which detracts from the actual contents of the roll . again , not a bad thing , just not my thing . my first date with the boyfriend was at shinju , now fat salmon . it will always have a special place in my heart , but it just isn ' t the same . womp womp . 
i have never had a bad meal here . the food is fresh and consistent . the restaurant is noisy and it ' s difficult to have a quiet conversation . don ' t go hear on a first date , but it ' s great for going out to dinner with friends , etc . 
love the bartenders here ! ! always welcoming and make a great cocktail . food is good , consistent . definitely becoming a home bar for me . 
we had dinner last night at big fish . honestly the worst meal i ' ve ever had , especially at a seafood restaurant . my family ordered a variety of dishes pizza , fish and chips , a potato-encrusted halibut special and shrimp scampi . with the exception of the scampi , everything else was significantly below par . cape codder salad was basically chopped lettuce and they left off the dressing . my halibut was non-existent , all potato no fish . the service was slow and snarky . a few years ago , this was a family outing we enjoyed but we will not be coming back now . 
horrible ! was leaving the record exchange and stopped in for a quick bite . didn ' t even finish the meal just threw it out and left . i ' ve gotten better tasting more authentic italian food out of a can . you could not pay me to step foot in this place again . do yourself a favor and stay away . 
who doesn ' t like gooey , melty , mac ' ncheese comfort food ? that ' s what we wanted but this place just couldn ' t live up to the hype to give us just that . saw it across from the montclair bread company , which is where we love shopping for bread and baked treats ! looks spacious inside but sparse seating even though we were the only ones ( me and my two N-yr old toddlers ) who sat up front in the sofa seating area to eat . ordered two kid meals which came with apple slices or apple sauce , and juice box . sounds good , but it wasn ' t . expensive option for subpar meal the classic mac was drier and hardly gooey , and my mac cheese little guy thumbed his nose at it after just a few spoonsful . he normally gobbles everything up and asks for " mo maccheez " . his sis spat out the mealy apple slices and is the one who will eat whole apples just to ask for another one . my manchego sticks were soggy and sitting in a pool of oil atop the paper-lined plate . seriously unappetizing ! my tomato soup was too salty and spicy and just plain , awful . they offered to replace with complimentary cream of broccoli soup , which tasted just ok , and had an uneven texture with the partially chopped ( unblended ) broccoli and partly melted cheese . thought it would be a treat for me and the kids for a lunch date , but it really doesn ' t interest me enough to go back . 
this dive bar has charm . we came in a large group and grabbed a huge picnic table . most of us ordered their pork sandwiches , two for N and they hit the spot . sweet potato fries were decent . i don ' t know if they ' re used to handling large crowds because everyone who didn ' t order pork had to wait a while for their food after we got ours . no big , we weren ' t expecting much better . when i stepped back inside i saw that there ' s only one guy in the kitchen - slack cut . when it got cold outside they lit up the fire pit which was really cozy and nice . inside it isn ' t too crowded and they have a decent selection of board games . vodka cranberry was nicely sized and only N . the guys liked the beer list . we ended up spending at least N hours here and had a good time . i ' d come back if i was in red hook again for some reason . 
this place was recommended to us by a friend who know i ' d be with a large group of people at sleep no more . it was about a N minute walk away from the theater ( and half of it we could do via the high line so , bonus ) . being a saturday night , the place was very busy , but our large party of N was easily seated at the ping pong-style table in the lower level . there was plenty of room to move around--which you don ' t always get in nyc restaurants--and this midwesterner never once felt claustrophobic . we ordered a bunch of dishes and ate family style . potato chip nachos decadent and a great balance of flavors and textures . i could have eaten the whole portion myself . duck breast the general consensus is that it was the best anyone at the table had ever had . my husband couldn ' t stop raving about it and he normally dislikes duck bone marrow i ' m not as adventurous as my party , but they loved it . the only thing that wasn ' t shared at the table was a the bone marrow burger . the person who ordered it took one bite and promptly refused to share the love with anyone else . roasted vegetable and goat cheese terrine delicious , smokey and earthy--the perfect complement with baguette and great if you ' re looking for something a little lighter . rabbit croquettes most of the people at our table ( including myself ) hadn ' t eaten rabbit before , but would definitely get these again . not gamey at all--which is usually what i ' d heard about rabbit . bacon infused whiskey it ' s delicious , but to be fair , it tastes more like bourbon than whiskey . not a problem for me since i ' m not really a whiskey fan . bacon ice cream you must try this . half of the table loved it , the other half didn ' t . i thought it was phenomenal . it ' s kind of like salted caramel ice cream but with bacon flavoring . bar drinks besides the aforementioned whiskey , there ' s a fabulous wine menu and a lot of great craft beers to choose from . something for everyone ! the service was great ( even on a busy saturday night ) , the food was great and i ' m looking forward to going back for more . 
i had ordered form sanford ' s many times before going into the actual place today . they were closed for a while and now have reopened with a new fancier look - first warning this is not a diner . i went to brunch with my wife and the first impression was positive the place was full ( we waited N min for a table ) and they have a nice N " prix fix " brunch menu . we both went with eggs benedict juice ( she with coffee and me with hot chocolate ) and that was when things started going bad . first , they brought two coffees . after i told them i had asked for hot chocolate ( without whipped cream ) , they bought me a hot chocolate . with whipped cream . when they brought the oj , mine had a small hair in it . so far , a few mistakes , but justifiable ones given that it was the rush hour for brunch . then the food came and quickly the disappointment followed . the eggs benedict were just bad the english muffin was burned and the eggs were completely overcooked ( the yolks were solid ! ) . the hollandaise sauce and the potato hashes were good , but not great . we decided to give it another shot with the banana chocolate chips pancakes . after waiting for around N minutes for our plates to be removed and for someone to take our order ( this in a time were there was a line outside ) , they finally arrived . you could tell from the get-go that they were pre-made pancakes . there was no maple syrup with them , just a few small boxes of some generic ( terrible ) corn syrup . they tasted bland and , although the banana was there , there was very little sign of the chocolate chips . i will eat again at sanford ' s because it ' s pretty near where i live and they deliver . i had their burgers and wraps before and they were decent , nowhere near the debacle of today ' s brunch . i ' ll try them again in the near future and , if necessary , update my rating and comments . final thought don ' t go here for brunch ! it ' s crowded , the service is terrible , it ' s loud and the food is just plain bad . 
not many greek restaurants around . but this one does it right . fresh seafood , traditional gyro platters , greek wine ! some of my favorites are the octopus , gigante beans the eleniki prassini salad . you have to try this place if you are in the monroe area . only downfall is that it is a little pricy but i guess you get what you pay for
generally pretty impressed with the place ! i ' ve been looking forward to trying aksum for a while now . i ' ve heard great things about the brunch ( not too sure about how it is for dinner ) . a friend and i stopped by at around N N am and were seated immediately ( no reservation needed ) . the service was absolutely excellent and is probably the reason for my four star review ( though my dish probably would have been somewhere between a N and N . N star ) . our waitress was warm and genuine and happily talked us through the menu and cracked a couple of jokes . positive service like this can go a long way ! i settled on the shakshuka eggs and my friend ordered the monte cristo sandwich . presentation wise , the food was on point . taste-wise , the dish was great-- perfectly spiced , and texture of the baked eggs was heavenly . i definitely would have liked more pita bread to dip into the tomato stew ( it only came with about N small triangles of pita bread ) and i would have liked for the tomato stew to be a bit warmer ( i have a feeling my dish was ready to go before it was served and was thus cooling in the kitchen ? ) my friend was gawking over the monte cristo sandwich throughout our meal ( i ' m vegetarian so i didn ' t try it ) but it looked beautiful and she said it was delicious as well . i did try some of the apricot jam and potatoes that came on the side of the dish , and both were beyond tasty ! i definitely will be returning to try the famous french toast as well as other nontraditional breakfast varieties . this is a cute spot and is definitely not frequented enough-- would love to see more people coming through ! 
comfortable interior made up of furniture in a variety of wood colors . a couple bars . bar stools with chair backs earn points from me . pleasant staff who , at the slow start of happy hour on a tuesday , were gathered like wall-leaning hip kids at one end of the bar . our waitress was cool , and she served up water as soon as we sat down . it ' s the little things . happy hour offerings are priced for the happiness of the hour ( s ) . carmelized onion dip ( w rice crackers , pita-style flat bread crisps san roman fresh tortilla chips ) had an unexpected consistency and was pretty tasty . enjoyed the variety of chips . also had some fries . music was pretty odd , reminded me of pst and yN circa year N , but sprinkled with more current hits and occasional dragging radiohead tunes taht were not entirely suitable for the setting . wish i had tried the pickled vegetable board and boulevardier cocktail , but there ' s always next time . 
looong overdue review . . . i ' ve been eating at sharky ' s for N years now . they have fantastic food and the wings are in my top N . i like them hot and sharky ' s wing sauce is not only hot , but it ' s flavorful . it ' s not very aesthetically pleasing , but i ' m not going for the atmosphere , i ' m going for awesome wings , great apps , and cold , cheap beer . 
i have gone to piccoli after reading some of the reviews myself . some of the reviews were bad while others were amazing , so i decided to try this place myself . right when i walked in the place looked outdated and that set my first impression . after that i ordered my first meal and it looked amazing . the food also tasted amazing and although the atmosphere wasn ' t great , i would definitely come here for the food . 
bakery chai latte fresh madeline the perfect cold weather treat ) do try ! and on the weekends ( or wednesdays ? something like that haha ) they have an amazing chocolate bread that i swear you won ' t be able to find anywhere else ! ! restaurant i ' ve been here for brunch and dinner and i ' ve gotta say that both meals have been pretty spectacular ! the fries , the waffles , the escargot . . . but the best part has got to be the atmosphere . nothing seems stuffy or overdone at balthazar . it actually reminded me a lot of paris ) which then made me miss paris and wish i was there instead of new york , ha ! the service in both places are very good . the prices are high , but you do get what you pay for . remember to make reservations in advance ! the wait is typically very long and it sucks to be outside looking in on all the lucky bastards eating their fries . mm . . . 
come visit - order the frittata . soooo yummy and presentation is beautiful ! coffee here is great too . came with one friend and waited only about N minutes on a saturday around noon . not bad ! 
i went to that place one time and the food was delicious ! ! ! 
awesome , sunday breakfast , i had the blueberry pancakes and sausage was perfect , and the sercive is unbeatable and the price was cheap , oh yeah ! ! , i reccomed this place
the spaghetti alla carbonara is ok . i advise all to avoid the maccheroncini it is very salty . you can probably manage to eat your way through if your waiter keeps you well supplied with water , but otherwise it is near unbearable . the service is great at least when i was there with family . great atmosphere and great wine list for the location . the wine list offered half bottles in addition to whole bottles . it was nice to have that option so we could have wine with dinner but not be tied down to a full bottle . 
we went to zahov by chance on a sunday night after a movie , not knowing anything about it ahead of time . it turned out to be a great experience . the menu items were unusual to us , but the waiter was most accommodating . he explained any item we had a question about and offered recommendations . our selections were delicious ! the humus with their baked laffa bread is incredible . we especially enjoyed the crispy haloumi which was brought complimentary after they had run out of the bronzino we had selected . the customer service was extraordinary . the attention we received was unmatched . the night ended with a dessert tehina semifreddo , which was out of this world ! we can ' t wait to go back ! 
great service--not overbearing , but friendly and patient . the chef sent out several extra dishes for us to taste . 
i am a bit of a pizza nut , and this place is freaking amazing ! the most inventive pizzas i ' ve ever seen anywhere . skip the salads and dessert and focus on the pizzas , come with a big group and sample a couple . try the honey jones pizza if they have it that night ! ! ! 
probably the only place in new york that sells poutines . their service is great and their prices are reasonable . i always swing by at least once a week to get their poutines or a regular order of fries with curry ketchup ( might sound gross but i love it ) . worth every cent ! 
waiting for our check as i wrote this . first thingts first , service is extremely slow and disappointing . my salad took about N minutes to arrive and was so so . we waited very patiently and anxiously for our margharita and porcini pizzas . another N minutes to arrive and were very disappointing . they were tasteless and extremely soggy which didn ' t make for a great meal . we read wonderful reviews but for my husband and i it was truly a waste of time . 
pat ' s my choice for late night , greasy cheese steak ! given the all time rivalry of pats vs genos , it ' s all about the meat . it doesn ' t have all the glitz and lights like geno ' s does from across the street but it ' s my go to if i want to satisfy my fat craving . i usually get the american whit and never cease to amaze me as soon as i eat it . oh and make sure you get some of the fixin ' s on the side such as the whole hot peppers . yum ! 
the seafood mariscada is excellent and the garlic shrimp appetizer is exceptional . the quality of the seafood is superb and the sangria is tasty . i visit this restaurant at least six times a year for various occasions including birthdays and anniversaries . 
the greatest italian . . . capalleni syracuse is exceptionlly good . puffed bread is fantabulosly uniquie . bread with tomoto sauce on top is excellent as well . great service and dishes served with soup or salad . we are going back soon taking more visitors next time . 
i don ' t say this lightly but this might very well be the worst burger i ' ve ever had . i mean , who wrote these glowing reviews - the owner ' s niece ' s and nephew ' s that were thrown out of their apts and have no where else to crash ? the bun - flimsy and doughy , the lettuce and tomatoes - aged and crispless , the fries - mcdonalds like , the patty - dry and flavorless , i could have dumped the entire salt shaker on that bad boy and it wouldn ' t have made a difference . major fail . do yourself a favor - skip . 
 update - added a star because the owner reached out to apologize for the experience , and because the food is tasty , once you ' re actually able to order it my original review . . . incredibly annoyed . i called melt shop at N N am looking to place a delivery order , as their website ( which usually offers online ordering ) wouldn ' t allow me to do so . the guy who answered the phone informed me that although they open at N N am , they don ' t start delivering until N N pm . i should also note that i wanted something from the breakfast menu , which apparently stops at noon . so to reiterate , they only serve breakfast from N N am until N pm - a half hour ! i have never heard of menu items being available for just N minutes . and they won ' t deliver before N N . so what ' s the point of offering breakfast options at all ? but whatever . my girlfriend and i were really in the mood for grilled cheese , so rather than getting food elsewhere , we waited . i called back at N N pm to place my order . at this point , we hadn ' t eaten anything yet , and we were starving . the same guy now told me the schedule changed and they won ' t be delivering until N N pm . ridiculous . get your act together . get your story straight . so now my girlfriend was like , " ugh , this is annoying . i ' ll just go pick it up . " we live a few avenues away , so it wasn ' t the end of the world . it ' s just nice to eat breakfast in pajamas once in a while on the weekends , but again , whatever . she got dressed and left the apartment , order in hand , on a mission to get our grilled cheese sandwiches . it ' s N N pm at this point and our stomachs are eating themselves . you know the feeling i ' m talking about . at N N pm , i get a call . " well , looks like we ' re not getting melt shop after all . " i didn ' t understand . " what do you mean ? ! " i asked her . " turns out they are now closed . apparently the windows are being power washed or something . i don ' t know . they were not helpful , and just said they would be closed for at least the next hour . " so to recap - they open at N N am . but they don ' t deliver until N N pm . at which point they have already stopped serving breakfast . and they close at random times , during the prime brunch hour , to wash their windows . cool . epicfail
i ' m still so happy about this meal . . . we too were traif rejects like many writing here . we went to traif on a sunday night with no reservation assuming it ' d be slower than other nights . not the case even for a table of two . they offered to seat us at the bar or go to sister restaurant xixa . we opted for the unknown and headed to xixa . xixa was quite dead -- and i have a feeling that won ' t be for much longer . we ordered N plates and got a treat from the kitchen added to the order . N . charred green onions potatoes in some ridonkulus sauce . we licked it up with our fingers . . . N . short ribs -- we sucked the bones clean . N . the corn ( elote off the cob it has a name that slips me ) . it was cooked in tom yum soup . we fought over this dish and drank the broth until it was gone . we said " next time we ' re ordering two of these . " and for only N , why not ? N . the surprise dish came out from the kitchen . i believe they said it was the carnitas ? pork , pineapple , on top a tamale or sweet bread of some sort . it was sweet and spicy . not our favorite but happy to have the taste . N . rice beans with green chorizo . definitely a higher end risotto vs . your typical traditional rice beans . i recommend it because we also wiped this dish clean but it wasn ' t our favorite overall . it was very filling for a small plate which is a good dish to have with a small plate exclusive dinner , right ? you want to leave hungry . N . fundido was saved for last . truffles , cheese , and chorizo . . . have you seen the simpsons episode where lisa goes crazy over truffles ? that was us . we would ' ve turned violent fighting over the last bite if we weren ' t in a public place . good god this was good . it ' s a food bomb and filled us beyond the point of being able to have dessert . that is my only warning . worth it ? yep . this is one of the nicer meals we ' ve had in nyc . we felt very special throughout , like big spenders , and yet the bill was under N ( we had some glasses of wine ) . pretty amazing . i love brooklyn . 
i ' m very proud to call this our ' around the corner coffee shop ! we love kickshaw and it was one of the selling points of our apartment . . . well ok , we ' d already signed the lease , but we had coffee afterwards at kickshaw and knew that it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship ! i ' ve enjoyed watching this place grow , first from a great coffee shop bar with some killer grilled cheese ( and a delicious tomato soup ! ) and then to a fantastic brunch spot ( i highly recommend the potato cake , it ' s made with potato , butter , asiago and angel ' s tears . . . i ' m almost certain ) . their coffee is delicious and their baristas are very talented . there is always some beautiful art on the top of my latte , but they also do a great pour over or a no nonsense drip to go ( take along a butter croissant , you won ' t regret it ! ) now they are talking extended dinner menu and i couldn ' t be more excited ! until then , head over for their fantastic mac and cheese or their delicious kitchen sink salad with a cornucopia of tasty pickled veggies . i gave this place N stars because i can ' t say enough good things about them , i only wish they had more tables because it ' s starting to get crazy busy all the time ! ( good news for them ! ) 
food and service are both top notch . i ' ve eaten here a number of times and enjoyed the oriental chicken ( both the salad and the wrap ) and the soy salmon , but my favorite thus far is the salmon salad . i ' ve also been told the bison burger is good . 
this place is a crowd pleaser so it ' s often an option when i ' m with a large group and everyone has different tastes . they have plenty of veg and non veg options ( including kangaroo meat ! ) on the menu . the staff is friendly and helpful . i was more excited about the food when i was reading about it on the menu then when i was actually eating it , but maybe that ' s because the vegetarian options aren ' t super special or interesting . i have a feeling that they have dessert down pat but i haven ' t had dessert here yet . it ' s a good option when you want to switch things up in astoria and go somewhere new . the portions are large , the drinks are yummy , and in the summer it ' s nice , bright , and breezy inside . 
i am a new wave fan usually and have been frequenting this spot for the last two years . my experience today , however , made me upset enough to write this review . prior to today , i would have rated new wave with N-N stars - please be sure to take that into consideration when reading this review further . my fiance and i went for brunch this afternoon . he ordered the bleu burger medium and i ordered huevos rancheros . when our food came , my fiance ' s burger was pretty much rare and half of his fries were frozen . my order was N egg short , had no cheese , and absolutely no seasoning on any of it whatsoever . it was two charred tortillas , plain white rice , half of an avocado , three slices of tomato and a few forkfuls of bland pulled pork . they didn ' t have two of the beers on tap that we ordered at first . overall , it was a pretty disappointing experience . it could have been an off day or a new cook . i hope that is the case and that it gets better . when the bill came and we paid over N for that meal , i wanted to cry ( not really , but i sure as heck wasn ' t thrilled about spending that kind of money on our meal ) . i know that we should have spoke up but that is something i truly don ' t enjoy doing . 
ordered a sicilian hoagie on a seeded roll with long hots for delivery , when primos wouldn ' t deliver , and was not disappointed . delivery arrived within N minutes and was delicious . 
delicious curries and indo chinese food . friendly staff , the mixed grill is delicious . . dal makhni is must have . the biryani is delicious . did i forget it ' s byob . . i am a regular
the corned beef pastrami rueben combo was out of this world . food smackdown rightous . our whole party was attending a convention accross the street and hershel ' s came highly recomended by the people at the hotel and at the convention center . boy were they right . the staff was incredibly friendly and everyone in our group gave it two thumbs up , a definite don ' t miss in philly . will without a doubt go back when we return . 
wanted to love it . . . . but didn ' t . surprised ( when we asked ) what was homemade on the menu listings , and the response ( for so many items ) was that they were frozen ! i appreciate the honesty . . . . . and won ' t go with a lower rating , as i want the business to work see the quality improve . for those who love it- good , but i must be missing something ! 
i love chocolate ! ! ! if you do too . . . then this is the place for you . they have the best hot chocolate i ' ve ever had in my life . i tried the salted caramel and milk chocolate with wafer balls , both to die for . the food was also very good ! i recommend the wings for the appetizer , the spinach artichoke dip was good as well . the fish tacos with mango slaw was very good but the rice red beans the come with are amazing . i ' m from the caribbean , i know about red beans and rice . . . . the fries was just ok , they ' re dressed with cocoa powder . my only complaint is the tables small and its loud , but with food like that i really don ' t care . definitely leave room for dessert . 
where do you go to order the best sandwich you ' ve ever had , anywhere ? i go here , to salumeria in reading terminal for the roast beef hoagie . it is the perfect blend of ingredients and bread . they have their own tasty base coat that sets up the experience , and they put artichoke hearts on , if you wish . the advantage of a busy place like this is in the freshness of its offerings . salumeria ' s ingredients are always excellent , always fresh . prepare yourself for a line . it ' s the cost of greatness . 
ok , junipers food is great and all , but so is meals on wheels when you are starving to death , which i bet has better service . i was seated in the backyard , which is code for dump , and was told " i ' ll be right back with menus . " N minutes , N minutes , N minutes go by and bitch never came back . idk what i am supposed to do with ' service ' like that . when i left , the waitress was at the counter intensely looking at her phone , glanced up as we were leaving and looked right back down . it was almost as if she was expecting us to leave . the food is good , i ' ll say that . however , as i have come to learn you do not always get the chance to enjoy or even order their food . 
when first open , this pizza was very good and service was good . since changing ownership , it is not . instead of white pizza , we received a shrimp , sausage , garlic . called to say we were returning , and were told correct pizza would be made . instead , we clearly were given the one from our original order , and it was cold though we live a short distance away . no apology , no refund , nothing . 
 ( my very first review on yelp ) got my food in less than N mins . it was very good ! N fed me and my daughter and there is still enough for another person to eat . try the general tso ' s chicken ! 
their food is good but their takeout takes forever . they will make you wait an entire hour and a half for delivery on a monday . never again ! 
i wanted to edit my cantina review because they have really improved in the last year . they have new management , new staff and new food . i love the atmosphere in the bar area--it ' s friendly and not too loud to have a conversation . i usually end up having a beer or two and one special margarita . most recently , i had a cherry margarita . it tasted like a cherry limeade--i ' m definitely getting another one ! brunch is my preferred meal at cantina . they always feature new specials and delicious bloody marys and marias . my favorite picks at cantina ? -goat tacos or burrito -plantains -ensalada de nopal -breakfast burrito with veggie sausage -pastel de chocolate ( chocolate mousse with a bit of hot chili ) if you want to get the most out of it , head to cantina during a weekday or night--or for a late brunch ( try between N and Npm ) . it gets very crowded on weekend nights so plan ahead . 
it ' s just the best pizza and everyone must try it . any new yorker who isn ' t excited by the prospect of venturing to midwood , brooklyn to get one of the best pizza pies in the world , are crazy . you can read a gazillion reviews online with all the details of the fresh ingredients , how they are hand-made my dom dimarco . you can find video online of the difara ' s experience but you must go yourself , brave the mob and delight in the art of a true pizza master . 
great food , excellent service - i called in advance to prep the staff that this was a special event for my boss and his client . the client has been here on many occasions and favors this restaurant . the staff went above and provided a " first class " experience for our party . the client was impressed and grateful for the extra effort . thank you all and we will be back again and again . the parting cake gift is such a gracious , elegant touch . 
nom nom can do no wrong in my eyes . i ' ve been going regularly for a year . this place is perfection . i ' ve turned many people into fans and have always talked dates into coming here because i ' m addicted . get the karai extra spicy . it ' s amazing in the winter and clears up any sinus issues you may have lol . spider buns are also a must have . they now have a set of lockers that you can charge your phone in for free . this place is great . cash only or level up . 
umami means " pleasant savory taste . " indeed it was savory . due to opening week , the wait was close to N hours . good thing we swung by jinya first for a bowl of ramen to hold us over . the great thing about umami is that they text you when your table is ready , which allows you to hang out in the neighborhood rather than loiter in front of the restaurant . although the long wait , the food came out really quick . we even got our burgers before our drinks . service was good , very attentive . i was content with my order , the original umami burger but really like my friend ' s truffle burger . hopefully once they open the upstairs seating area the wait won ' t be so bad . if it is , go play some porno bingo while you wait ! 
hands down best chicken taco i ' ve ever had . it ' s so good i feel bad ordering any of the other tacos ( except for the lengua when they have it ) . dear taqueria diana , please make the lengua a regular taco ! much love , chun
the wine was bad and the portions were small . disappointing . 
thanks yelpers for leading me to pick this place out of all the rest in ktown . all of the small plates they serve before the meal were very tasty ! favorite the veggie pancakes . . . soo small though . . wanted to order extra order . prices at this place though ( if not the lunch special ) are quite high for the portion size . the mushroom rice in stone pot was absolutely delicious . pricey at about N bucks but worth it to try once . pork kimchi stew- we thought this would be a lot better than it was -- though tasty it had the tiniest and fewest pieces of pork i have ever seen in a dish ! that was a shame . . could have been much better . had to ask for the barley tea . . it was very good . no ginger tea was given to us at end of meal even though we asked . ( service was very nice though . left feeling hungry still , so wish portions were bigger . tried as hard as i could to pass by the N slice place ! 
this is our go-to take out delivery place . pizza is really good . we ordered aranchini to go and for like . . . N-N bucks or so . . . it was literally one rice ball . how can they possibly justify that ? lol . 
the namesake artichoke pizza is good , perhaps even very good , but it ' s not " the best " . it ' s basically a white pizza with whole artichoke chunks strewn throughout , along with spinach , garlic , bechamel , and mozzarella . you can order a huge slice ( easily N pizzas in N ) for N . the crab pizza is also noteworthy . this thin crust pizza is very thin , crispy , chewy , and foldable , if only the huge artichokes and globs of molten sliding cheese didn ' t prevent that endeavor . once you ' ve consumed half the slice , you may be able to maneuver into a more manageable fold up for more polite eating appearances . there ' s stella artois on tap to wash it down . claustrophobic people , beware . expect to be squashed as you queue up to order in this tiny east village restaurant front--just send in one of your friends , don ' t all come in at once--for what ? ! with that in mind , the staff here are very nice and patient . do not expect sit down dining , unless you don ' t mind sharing a small wooden bench outside with strangers who are waiting on their orders , possibly next to an overflowing garbage can . you can also politely elbow your way in for standing space against the chain link fence , next to a parking lot , with ambient street lamp lighting . if you ' re inebriated and it ' s the wee hours of the ' morn , this place is easily N-stars . 
great food great service . the portions were huge ! everything was so good and delicious . i go to school a couple of blocks away so i will be returning at least twice a week . highly recommended for a nice brunch time . 
came to fr re de lys for the first time today , and i ' ve rarely felt so welcome ! the two brothers alexis and thibault really did a great job ! the food is outstanding and the wine selection is worth the trip from brooklyn ! i will be coming back very very soon ! thanks for a great time
kimchi grill is good and cheap . i tried three burrito fusion dishes there ( i believe i tried the chicken , beef , and pork ) , and they are good but , again , nothing to write home about . if you ' re on a budget a need a good , cheap lunch , i ' d recommend this place . 
food is ok but the four stars are for their awesome cocktails and N dollar bar menu from N-Npm on the downside- almost everyone at the bar is over N . . . 
what i like the best is that the mobile stand is opened late at night . a good alternative to the diner nearby which is not so cheap after all . love this place ! 
greatness ! ! ! superb service and food so delicious you don ' t know when to stop . it all starts the moment you walk in . . . you feel right at home when you and your company are immediately welcomed . this corner restaurant is romantically lit with an exposed brick wall and interesting art work . we had reservations for N and were immediately seated upon arrival . i have to be honest . . . i am not a salad lover but their bibb lettuce salad with pancetta vinaigrette , crispy shallots and poached egg is so tasty . i just wanted more ! some other appetizers we had included fresh lentil soup , the most tender slow braised meatballs i have ever had and brussel sprouts topped with parmesan . i had the pork served over sweet potato puree and it was such a good combination . other people in my party were bragging about the duck entree . the desserts were so unforgettable you find yourself still talking about them with other people . the baby jesus is appropriately named since it ' s truly makes a life changing impact as soon as it meets your tastebuds . the entire staff was attentive and checked in with our party a number of times . i will definitely return here and recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent food , great ambiance and a good time . the owner , leo , really took care of us and for that we are grateful . 
i have only been there once and it definitely would be my last time in that restaurant . their sweet-and-sour soup tastes like a soy-sauce soup , vegetable looks like a gooey stuff and pork is whatever you name it . probably on that specific day , the chef was replaced by a first-day-at-work apprentice however , i am not going back to this restaurant any more . 
we made our trip to philadelphia for mainly one thing , and it ' s to try pat ' s king of steaks ! a dive that specializes in cheesesteak sandwiches with the cheez whiz being their most popular one . so , of course we had to order ours with the whiz ! their cheesesteaks are made of thinly chopped up rib eye steak . just throw a little hot sauce and peppers with it , and you ' re ready to take it down ! pat ' s is super busy , but you get your sandwich in seconds after it ' s ordered . it ' s absolutely a huge tourists spot , but with senator john kerry of ma , and barack obama being known to chow down the cheesesteaks at pat ' s , who wouldn ' t want to make the trip here ? ! pat ' s is definitely the signature restaurant spot to represent philly . 
this place is ok . i went and had the duck and it was delicious . but for the price they had on the menu it was such a small portion i was still hungry after i ate . it was just a let down because i love duck but it just wasn ' t filling and didn ' t do enough to satisfy my experience . ok place , def not worth the hype . i ' d rather go to deltas in new brunswick and pay those prices and end up with a more satisfying product . i dnt think i ' ll b trying duck here again anytime soon . 
great times , great pizza . yum yum . 
i ' ll keep this blunt . sarcone ' s is the only sandwich shop i ' ve ever gone too where i get angry toward the end of my sandwich because it ' s so good i don ' t want it to be over . now that ' s a strong sandwich . 
barcelona is a tapas spanish themed restaurant located in downtown new haven . although we had a pleasant experience here , i can easily imagine it becoming the type of place i wouldn ' t want to be within a mile of later at night . the decor of barcelona is very modern , although the seating was somewhat awkward and cramped . if the restaurant had been crowded , this could have been a major problem , but no one was seated near us so it was fine . this establishment primarily features tapas , and allows you to essentially construct a meal out of small and delicious appetizers . this seems like a great place to visit with a large number of people to maximize sharing and tasting . the tapas they we had were all very nicely prepared and quite delicious . they certainly were not a bargain , but were priced as to be expected in an upscale restaurant in new haven . the menu suggests getting a three tapas sampler , but be careful because i was very full after two of them . the beer selection was above average , including some captain lawrence and lagunitas ipas and although i am not much of a wine drinker , it seemed like that had a nice variety to offer also . my primary complaint with barcelona was the service , which left much to be desired . it took almost N minutes for me to receive my first drink and the waitstaff was not very attentive . i found this surprising because it was early in the evening and the restaurant was not at all crowded . i can only imagine how bad service could be on a busy friday or saturday night ! overall , i had an enjoyable experience at barcelona , but it does not seem like a place i would return to any time soon . 
might be the best halal spot in all of nyc . . . and that ' s saying a lot . great value , delicious food , and unlimited white sauce . also , pita bread is automatic , don ' t have to pay extra for it , which makes it all that more delicious . 
fool me once shame on you . fool me twice shame on me . first time i waited N minutes for food that never came . the manager couldnt be bothered to come out and talk about it . six months later i was convinced the place is good and to give it another try . sitting outside enjoying dinner with my wife and a N year old and they decide to let a group start smoking cigars where people are eating ! ! ! ! ! hello ! ! ! whether you like cigars or not ( which i do ) noone wants have cigar smoke blowing by while they are eating . especially around children ! ! i only gave N star because zero is not an option . 
this place is great ! i went with my mom and sister and we loved it . we ordered the spicy tuna roll , cucumber and eel roll and the cy-tuna roll with edamame to start . the waitress hostess was very friendly and attentive and our order came out quickly . the prices are reasonable too . i loved this place and will definitely be back ! 
best and most authentic banh mi in nyc . the place is very tiny - can only seat up to N people . so i would suggest not coming in big groups unless you ' re planning on getting your sandwich to go . haven ' t tried their other food but will always come back just for the banh mi alone . 
gelato is so creamy and delicious ! would have given it N stars of it wasnt so overcrowded
a rating , not ! ! ! ! ! do not eat at this establishment ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! a huge waterbug was brewing in the soup eeekkkk ! ! ! 
i totally agree with jonathan g . went there today for a pastrami sandwich based on the positive review in wednesday ' s ny times . the sandwich was tasty , but the pastrami was skimpy ( by new york city deli standards ) . counter service was friendly and efficient , but with a small crowd , it took way too long for the cooks to deliver a simple sandwich . also , i expected a pickle on the side , but alas there was none . it was very annoying that most of the tables were filled with computer users ( i counted N laptops ) who were sprawled out with empty coffee cups sitting next to them . apparently it ' s a great place to buy a cup of espresso and spend a few hours using free wifi . all the while the lunch crowd was jostling around trying to find two seats together . i ' ll give them another try ( the cortado looked yummy ) but if the same issues are encountered , i ' ll go somewhere else . 
i like coming here for the conchiglie balsamico , one of my favorite dishes ever . it is a creamy balsamic shell pasta with generous pieces of chicken and sliced asparagus . i have tried making it at home , but it didn ' t even come close . so , back to teresa ' s i ' ll go ! i also have tried their monday night pizza tastings . it ' s good to go with a large group ( N or N people ) and you get to have about N different pizza courses a salad for N ( ? ) per person ( add more for wine pairings ) . i wish their menu was a little bit more expansive , so that i could try a different dish to like , or that my date could have more options for dinner . it seems he goes between the few pasta dishes each time we go , with me always ordering the balsamic shells . 
the food and the service was great ! fortunately we went on friday for breakfast . tried to go the next day , but the line was tooooo long ( around the corner ) . if we had the time we would ' ve waited though . i would suggest , as popular as tom ' s may be , it would help newcomers find the place easier if there was better signage . 
read a review which said the pancakes were awesome . . . they were . . huge and moist with a little crunch at the edges . . wow . i am not a lover of pancakes but i tasted from someone ' s plate and so enjoyed . . . the spinach omelette with goat cheese was tasty and really enjoyable . . . on a hot morning we didn ' t have to wait and we opted to sit outside under the shade of a huge tree . . . was much quieter than the inside . . . for a sunday morning , there was not a long wait . 
love this place , never disappoints and again kayla you ' re a sweetheart , thank you we had a great time ! ! 
while touring the city , my husband and i decided to stop by the brooklyn taco co . usually i feel apprehensive about ordering at a place i ' ve never been to before because i am pretty particular about food . i ordered the chilorio brisket taco and was pleasantly surprised . it was a generous sized meal and was very flavorful . i really enjoyed the sweetness of the pineapple salsa but use a fork if you don ' t want to get too messy . my husband had the guaco taco and he really enjoyed it . i had a taste of it and enjoyed that as well . i recommend checking this place out if you are ever in town . 
yum . jacob ' s pickles became a family favorite in a matter of days . it ' s a place to take friends and do some drinking , but also a restaurant where you can bring your child in for an early dinner . the servers are nice , and the food is good . the smothered chicken with biscuits and grits is enough to feed two adults and one hungry child . their pancakes are great . i didn ' t have a found jesus moment with the mushroom mac and cheese , but my friends did , so there ' s that . anyway , big , big thumbs up . 
a visit to philly without going to the reading terminal market is not a proper visit . this place is phenomenal with so many excellent choices . this is not a food court where only a handful of vendors are good . here you will want to eat everything and not have enough stomach space . what to do ? buy some things ( like cookies , sandwiches , and chocolates ) to go and eat it later . this is a good place to go for lunch or brunch . even breakfast . you can go to the diner or eat the food of the amish . 
as an out of towner , of course i found this place to be pretty cool . i can see where it would be a tourist trap , but there isn ' t anything like it in boston ( even though the north end is awesome ! ) it was a bit of a maze to navigate thru , but there was a ton to look at each corner you turn . we ended up in the la pizza and la pasta and ordered various pizzas which were all delicious . i ended up ordering the spaghetti with black pepper , which was fantastic ! its was cheesy , buttery , peppery deliciousness ! there was a wait , which is to be expected , but our servers were all very pleasant and prompt once we were seated . i don ' t think this is a must see when in nyc , but if in the neighborhood , its definitely worth checking out and trying . . . who doesn ' t want cheesy , buttery , peppery deliciousness ? 
first off , since we only ordered the sushi , my opinions might be biased . however , i cannot say it better than my friend gerald did , when he reviewed this page in february of N " what is this place ? high end appearance inside a lower budget hotel . sushi ordered by a price quantity formula , rather than quality taste alone . " i think gerald was completely right in classifying it so . our waiter took quite a while to get us anything , and the place was eerily empty . despite having enjoyed a tasteful sushi dish myself ( the angry birds which i would in fact recommend ) , it did not make up for the atrocious wait time . the food was overpriced , at least in my opinion , and the only reason my family went , or might ever go again would be if we used the groupon deal that finally pushed us through pure ' s doors in the first place . 
i am writing this after eating a barrage of sushi after sushi . i am in love with this place ' s food . the variety , the care put into its creation , and the hospitality make the taste tenfold better ! i am a repeat customer
i had wings with some type of habanero sauce that was not good tasting at all . my husband had a burger that he wanted well done , and it was more than well done , as in crunchy . my sister in law had something they called mashed potatoes on the menu , but were served with the consistency of home fries . also , for being a vegan friendly place , they should mention on the menu that the baked beans have bacon in them , so people don ' t think that ' s a vegan friendly dish . the service was good , and beer selection was good as well . i ' m sure we ' ll stop back at some point to give this place another try . 
i went here twice within a week for the beer selection . the beer selection was very good , N craft beers on tap . the first time i came here , the salmon burger was pretty dry and not too good . the beer brat hot dog was pretty good , but i could get a good hot dog for much cheaper elsewhere . the second time i went here my girlfriend and i ordered medium burgers . hers came out correct , but mine came well done . neither of our burgers came with the side of sauce they were supposed to . my burger was supposed to be stuffed with mushrooms and shallots , but it seemed to not be the case . beer was good , but my girlfriend had to wait a while for her second beer . she ordered a N . N irish dry stout from victory , but was served in a smaller than pint glass ( maybe Noz ) . those glasses are usually used for stronger than average beers , not weaker . overall , i would say this was a disappointment , and that i will not be coming back here . for what you get it was pretty pricey . i would be willing to give it another try after they have gotten there shit together , but until then i will be at plan b or a similar " gourmet " burger place that can actually make your burger correctly . 
just has my boyfriends Nth surprise birthday party here and it was great ! the staff was super friendly and accommodating . i reserved a week in advance and the morning of i dropped off a huge cake and some table decorations . the food was delicious and our chef was a ton of fun ! when it came time for pictures one of the servers grabbed our N cameras and took pictures of the group with each one and decided we needed a silly picture taken as well ! they sung happy birthday N times and you can tell they were really having a good time with us . will definitely go again ! ( we had a party of N ) 
the dumplings and potstickers are average and are a bit on the greasier side . good thing is that they are very very cheap . extremely cramped place , expect to eat on the park bench nearby as there are only seatings for four . the ordering process was extremely disorganized , had to repeat me and my friends ' order several times , and even then , there were some items missing . okay place , but there are more comfortable locations where you don ' t have to be packed in a tiny place for average food ( but cheap ) food . 
the service is horrendous ( beyond description really ) and everything is a little bit too salty , but disregard the curative powers of their soup at your own peril . 
some people see this hole in the wall as a simple , cheap eatery that serves up cheap roasted meats over rice . i , on the other hand , see a life time of dedication and skill . the store front is pretty hard to miss . if it wasn ' t for the constant line that can stretch out the door and down the block , i would not have found it myself . don ' t let that line discourage you your patience will be rewarded . from dawn until dusk . this team of N serves up some of the best roast pork and duck on this side of chrystie street . just be patient this couple takes their job - and - their domain seriously . " she " works the morning noodles , " he " works everything meaty from taking your order , to chopping your meat , to packing , the taking your payment . the most bang for your buck is the two roasted meats over rice ( usually roast pork and duck for me ) for N . i also go for the roasted meats by the pound ( extra ginger garlic sauce please ! ) when i ' m looking to stock up . but of course , there are some opportunities here . one thing i ' m not super excited about is the roast pig . it ' s only made in small batches and is rarely as crisp as i ' d like it to be . and then there ' s the level of cleanliness that always makes me a little nervous . with only two in the front of the house , it is purely impossible for any cleaning to happen during the day . fortunately i never got sick . come with some patience . just don ' t come hungry . . . or you ' ll just end up cranky from the wait . 
stopped in here on a saturday night . i love the atmosphere , very dia de los muertos . the food and drink selection was solid . i had a big lunch , so just went with an order of calamari . it was really excellent , very tender , not at all chewy . my companion had the chicken sandwich which was surprisingly large . the fries that were served with it were great , reminded me of boardwalk fries . i went with southern tier pale ale as my beverage , they had some left from beer week . 
why haven ' t i been here ? ? ? i met up with a friend of mine for brunch here and what a pleasant experience it was . atmosphere was great and it was very well decorated and cute place to take a date if you want to impress her . and my goodness , their coconut pancake was to die for . i have never had anything like that before . and their version of eggs benedict with smoked salmon was incredibly good too . i am sure great weather had a lot to do with my experience but i think this place deserves a N-star rating . want to end a great date with a girl on friday night . take her here on sat morning . wink wink
fast and friendly . great for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ( i was surprised at how good their dinner menu was , with a wide selection to choose from ) . the wait staff is very friendly , and the owner is often around for dinner to check in and make sure you are happy with your meal . my daughter loves their pancakes . . . . their omelets are also quite good ( though lately the chef has been burning them slightly , so i ' ve chosen other items from the menu instead ) . nanny ' s chicken and vodka rig for dinner were among our favorites . a great local favorite . 
cafe triskell is simply my favorite restaurant in all of queens , and probably all of nyc . this place has one of the best savory crepes i ' ve tried . the mushroom ham swiss crepe is amazing . the place doesn ' t look like much from the outside , and from the inside it looks like a cozy little place . everything i have tried here has been fresh and delicious . there is a chef and a waitress , and everything is made to order , so depending on your perspective , this could very well be an upside . this place is way better than most crepes places , i can ' t wait to go back for more ! 
house special noodle soup was amazing . lots of meat , the broth was flavorful , and of course the noodles were tender . i have been here a bunch of times , and suggest sharing a bowl , and some of their dumplings . runs you less than N bucks , and is easily enough for N . 
risotteria made me believe in the awesomeness that is gluten free food again ! and you can take your friends who don ' t believe that celiac ' s eat as well as other people . . . ) 
joe ' s . . you are always true to me . pork crabmeat soup dumplings . ' nuff said . ( N orders is enough to split btwn two ) 
 N best neapolitan pizza margherita in nyc . properly properly good pizza in the style of naples . if you have spent time in italy you will be brought back . the authenticity of lucali is worth its weight in gold and N glorious red stars . 
i was in new york for a week on work and i managed to eat here twice . you might say that is a foolish choice in a city with a million unbelievable restaurants , but it was worth it . the ambiance is everything that i would ask for in a restaurant . cozy , romantic , dreamy . the food sealed the deal . it was delicious ! my friend and i ordered everything to split so we could sample as many of the amazing sounding items as we could manage . all good ! it was possibly my most happy dining experience . plus i saw josh hartnett dining there with his oh so cool dude friends and oh so annoying girl friends and i realized " hey , he kinda is a heart throb . . . " 
this place is truly pathetic . after a N minute delivery estimate , which was sad considering the restaurant is a N minute drive away , i was still willing to give it a go . after an hour and N minutes and no wings to speak of , i gave the restaurant a call to see what was up . they said the delivery had left the store N minutes ago . N minutes after calling , the delivery driver showed up . he called and demanded that i come downstairs to pick up the food . i asked him to come up to my apartment ( i have a broken leg , which is part of the reason i requested delivery ) , and he refused citing " company policy " not to deliver food to an apartment door . hmm . . . i have several friends who live in this building and have ordered delivery multiple times from this joke of a place , and every single time they come to the apartment door . so long story short , this delivery driver was a jackass , and after driving my wings around new haven for an hour plus , i didn ' t really trust the food any more . i politely refused to hobble down to his car . so obviously i can ' t rate the food quality , but with such bad service i doubt it could be worth it . next time i ' ll just go with s ' wings or archie moore ' s . 
our favorite pizza in new haven . fills up quick , get there early ! parking is horrible in new haven , but that ' s no surprise . . . . 
this is the kind of bar that my grandfather would love . good food , lots of " old man beers " and a fish tank sports tvs to watch . other old men agree , as this is filled with them . the music however , is not for old men with its beck , morrissey , and whatnot . the roast beef sandwich is cheap and delicious . the golden brown french fries are good too . this isn ' t the place where two people should go to tie one on , but its great for a group of friends to have casual drinks and an array of party comfort food in a relaxed , spacious setting . 
great little place for a falafel snack . very fast service , and very cheap . you cant beat N . N for a falafel . in fact , last night i made falafel and it cost me N ! ! ! anyhow , its a very very small establishment , so dont plan on sitting , just take your falafel and run ! you could sit outside on the bench and eat your falafel , which is what we did and it was nice to eat your falafel and have the next door belgium waffle aroma waft over . 
this place serves delishiouso pizza ! it has all the flavor of a wood fired pizza and the toppings are so rediculously fresh ! been here N times in N months and picked up a few for take out and every pizza has been spot on ! the salads are seasonal and change slightly to what the farmers markets are selling and the small plates are a great way to start the meal . the pizzas old school or artisinal are really the best around for what they put on them . bar is a favorite place for pie and a close second was modern ( although they had a few technical difficulties a few times this year it seemed ) so between those type of pizzas here lies de legna . try the ceasar salad and the salad with beemster cheese favorite pies the napoli the tonno
amazing italian food , great for date night
i was expecting more , but it was okay . hubby and i like to share everything we order , so we got the buttermilk biscuit sandwich and country breakfast . we also ordered pancake with warm maple butter . 
omg date cake ! ! ! that ' s all you need to know about this place . we ordered three out of the N desserts including date cake , the donuts , and the ganache . the donuts are skippable , ganache was pretty good , the date cake was mind blowing . ok i ' m definitely hyping it up way too much again but what ' s another way to say it was freaking awesome but still go in with moderate expectations ? ? we each had a bite and immediately wished we had ordered three date cakes instead . we were stuffed from dinner , but it was so good that we contemplated for N full seconds whether we should order a second , caved in , and devoured another . on to the place itself . i don ' t think the restaurant is located in the best part of williamsburg . the menu even mentions that a car service is located next door and encourages you to " get home safe " . it ' s also not marked - it ' s just the unsuspecting restaurant on the corner . you then pull away the heavy black curtains and you are transported into a prohibition era style bar restaurant . they have live music going on every night and we enjoyed the jazz that was playing on the tues night that we went . there was a full dinner drinks menu as well but we didn ' t order any typical dinner items . a couple of my friends got black velvets . not a big fan personally , but they also had other beers drinks on the menu . will definitely return here for that delicious cake . . . cash only ! 
absolutely incredible ! to say this place is authentic german cuisine is an understatement you literally feel like you ' re in a beer hall in munich ! the food is top-quality and the beer is amazing . the best part is their affinity for european football and their annual oktoberfest and maifest events . 
i have eaten my share of authentic mexican food . . but this food made what i had before a joke . the pollo . asado burrito was so fresh and they actually give you a generous amount of chicken and guacamole . i was full and could not stop eating . well worth the N bucks . will come back to try the tacos . 
yayyayyayayyayayyayyayyay
stayed in white river junction for the night . looked at the reviews and selected the elixir . small menu but seemed appealing . crowded at N N on a friday night . sat at the bar to have a drink . atmosphere is very nice . a little loud , but it was crowded . we were seated at a good table in about N minutes . service was very good . the food was excellent . wine list is extensive . local beers on tap . full bar and martini list in the menu . much better than i expected . presentation was excellent . price was reasonable considering the quality ( compared with burlington , vt , portland , me or portsmouth , nh ) . potion size was reasonable as well . highly recommended . 
perfect for happy hour . margaritas are N and they ' re not watered down for happy hour . if you ' re a vegetarian , the cactus and sweet potato tacos are the best thing here . wings are decent , as are the N unlimited chips . the only reason i don ' t give it N stars is because i find the bbq to be meh . 
way overpriced . sloppy service . after one hour the food came out and the fries were cold and soggy ( obviously ) . second attempt , still soggy . 
what an adorable little space ! came here for brunch one day . service was excellent , though perhaps the decor was a bit dark for a brunch gathering -- this place would be lovely and romantic for dinner . did i mention they have a bar ? the prices were decent and the cocktail menu was intriguing , but i wasn ' t there for booze . i ordered the shrimp and grits . the grits were a bit drier than i hoped they ' d be , and there were only three shrimp on the plate . a good number of tasty chunks of fried pork belly and a spicy cream sauce helped out , but i wasn ' t blown away . one of my friends got the monte cristo , which was massive . i was told it was good . the huevos rancheros looked like a winner too . probably deserves a three based on food for me , but service was great and it ' s a charming place , so N from me . maybe i ' ll come back for dinner some time . 
finally a place with great vegan food in the financial district ! i ' ve been a here a few time now and everything has been awesome . 
i ' m in town for a convention and went looking for something i don ' t eat as often in cali . rangoon was a quick walk from the hotel and got pretty good reviews , i figured i ' d give it a shot . restaurant was pretty quiet , and i got a seat right away . the server poured me a water and left the pitcher on the table . . . not used to that . it ' s fine when you have the room , but i didn ' t think it was a sign of great service . i ordered my shrimp lemongrass soup . a small somewhat sloppily poured bowl arrived ( see pix ) . another sign of service quality . the soup was tasty , a strong sour savory lemongrass , tomato , and chicken broth with some small mushrooms and a lonely shrimp floating . the main course arrived a few minutes later . . . accompanied by a chipped bowl of white rice . i ' m not asking for lennox china and crystal goblets , but chipped dishes should be tossed ( cost of doing business ) . the mango chicken was fine at first taste , but got sweeter with every bite until i felt like i was eating dessert for dinner . the chicken was tasty , mango seemed fresh and firm , ingredients were fine . . . . but the cloyingly sweet sauce was overpowering . 
great selection of craft beer , great service and the best burgers in town . try the cowboy burger . . . 
i loved the peanut-sauce wonton ! that was delicious , as well as the salmon-avocado rolls . if you ' re looking for a cute place to get a variety of asian foods , i highly recommend ! 
yum ! the gyros and sambosas are the best i ' ve ever had , and the sauces make them even better . the lamb shank is so tender and flavorful . i love the borani banjan ( eggplant ) , and i ' ve never had rice like that before . the baklava is made with pistachios instead of walnuts and is soft and moist with honey . i can ' t wait to try everything else on the menu ! the owner is a very hard-working woman and as sweet and friendly as could be . tashakor ( thank you ) ! 
for the price they charge , this place rocks . fresh salads and quality meat . my go to place for a healthy bite to eat . one quick tip - they have a surprisingly diverse dessert section on display , but i say skip all of that and go to a bakery for dessert . 
if you like to wait forever for overpriced cafeteria-style spanish carribean fast food then this is the place for you . the wait time in the stuffy , hot , smelly staircase is never correct and the staff is rude at best- particularly the owner with a napolean complex and an embarressing mustache . 
i ' ve been here a few times and the food is quite tasty . the reason i give this place N stars instead of N is because i ' ve had some good meals and some excellent meals . agricola is a farm to table , locally sourced , and seasonal fare restaurant . the menu is changing which is why some meals have been better than others . most recently i had burrata with fried green tomatoes , a goat cheese and potato terrine with roasted beets , and a mushroom flatbread . all were phenomenal . previously , i ' ve had two pasta dishes ( spring time veggie pasta with peas and a butternut squash pasta in a light broth-y sauce ) and they were both average , there was nothing very creative or memorable about either . i ' ve also had some amazing desserts ( homemade graham cracker and huckleberry ice cream sandwiches ) and cocktails ( gooseberry margarita ) here . the price point is a little on the high side but i definitely recommend it for an occasion . 
the decor is the least of its downfalls . the only authentic thing about the place were the vacant thoughtless eyes of the wait staff . the food , while not over priced , is of little value after you discount for service , location and atmosphere . better off going hungry then wasting time and money in this pit . 
some of the best mexican i ' ve had in nyc . small and cramped but the quality of food and drink make up for it . 
fiore you make me think ai ai make the pasta blink i love your seafood saucy ink a bottle of liquid entertainment drink red and white vino clink atmosphere is more classy than trendy , dress appropriately . food is very good and worth the price . unique concoctions of homemade pastas and creative sauces . try the soft shell crab appetizer and the trofie nero pasta in seafood squid ink sauce . i know , but trust me , it ' s delicious . the setai is a beautiful setting for this second floor dining special . large floor space , mysterious and modern trimmed walls . after dinner head downstairs for some jazzy jazz in the intimate hotel lounge and bar . 
this is a N . N star review . stopped by here this past weekend around N Npm , got the tuna and soft shell crab . sushi is cheap , but i ' d say i ' ve had fresher quality at other places in the city . come if you want decently priced booze and cheaper sushi . 
best pizza on the east coast ! 
the ambiance , the experience , the food . . . . phenomenal ! nuff said ! 
simply unique , and the food is next to amazing . their brunch items are delicious , especially their eggs benedict . if you do order the lamb sausage , know that they are beyond well seasoned , as in , to the point you might not like them . but from sampling all of the other items ( from friend ' s plates ) , the food is very well done , and scrumptious . your taste buds will definitely thank you for the flavors and textures when you come here . they do get busy on good days , so expect a wait at times . definitely coming back here every now and then , for the food that is . 
the english muffin burger turkey burger was great . too bad the waitress was a complete b ! service sucks , i would have came back for the burger , but she ruined it . seems like the white trash dash in there anyway . way to go in keeping new customers . 
easily the best burger i ' ve had in my life . try the southern style , it ' s amazing ! really cool restaurant friendly employees too . 
i love soup noodles ! and super taste is quite good , cheap and fast ! i ordered the duck soup noodle and the soup base did not disappoint . they were very generous with the duck meat . the noodles were good but not too memorable for its " hand pulled " quality , imho . there was no veggies to be found in my bowl , which sucked for me but i ' m sure its a delight for the carnivores out there . the venue itself is the typical absolutely-no-frill-eatery in chinatown the lady who takes the orders will be yelling and barking orders into the kitchen . no , she is not mad at you . the downside for me is that they use disposable bowls . . . . yes , they run fifty cents to a dollar cheaper than some other noodle place but i ' m willing to pay the extra buck for washing the reusable dinnerware . 
a classic bar ! dark , places to sit , can actually hear yourself speak , and the menu has pages of affordable whiskeys , bourbons , and ryes . ( yes ) most of the names i have never heard of before , being as they all are from small american distilleries , but i was more than happy with their quality . the noah ' s milk was my favorite ! after sorting through the booze portion of the menu ( which makes up about N of it - yay ! ) we ordered some food to share for the table and we were happy with the prices ( sandwichs were like N-N bucks ) but thrilled with the food ! the pickle platter was great to pick and share with a group and the chicken liver sandwich is just awesome - i can no longer claim to not eat the stuff . . . it was a little hard to find on the street , but inside it was comfortably dark ( i loved the bottle light fixtures hanging from the ceiling ) and the music was perfect for the atmosphere ( dylan , the clash - what more can you expect from a bar named after a bukowski novel ! ) two-thumbs way up ! finally a place with good booze and food that i can afford in this city ! 
the food was really , really good ! also , and during the summer , you can eat in their very nice enclosed patio ! you get to be outdoors , but you do not have to be on the sidewalk bothering passerby people ! 
my girlfriend and i have tried practically everything on the menu . the place is nice and the staff is friendly . favorites are curry goat oxtails sweet whiting mac cheese cabbage chicken wings it is worth the wait , you will not be disappointed ! 
this place is pretty much my go to hoagie shop . they are just a few blocks away from pat ' s steaks and geno ' s but they are galaxies away quality-wise . i think everyone who lives near pat ' s geno ' s should be going to cosmi ' s . these guys are grill masters . they make your sandwich special , just for you , not in an awful assembly-line of mass-produced and half-assed sandwiches . the have some of my favorite french fries in all of philadelphia . the chicken wings , unfortunately , are only so-so . they have a great cold drink selection , chips , desserts ( tastycakes , cookies ) , and a dessert cooler with ice pops and ice cream sandwiches , etc . plus , bonus , the have these terrific sesame seed rolls that take your hoagie up that one special notch . i get the turkey and they pack that mother with plenty or filler , enough to make it a two-meal sandwich . it is a great corner sandwich shop . second bonus sometimes there are cute girls working there . otherwise , there are affable south philly dudes who like to joke around . 
great addition to windsor terrace . . . stumptown coffee rocks . . . all food is organic shmanic grass fed free range etc . . . salads are always fresh , tasty , and inspired . sandwiches are good . . . not great . . but good . . . . desserts are kinda pricey . . . more than N for a little cookie ! . . . service is always great and it ' s quiet even when packed . great addition to the neighborhood . 
i would not recommend emporio . the staff is obviously overworked and making mistakes . my salad was actually wet ( ugh ) , and my friend ' s lamb skewer appetizer was undercooked . moreover , our entrees were not very impressive and my friend ' s was actually missing one of the ingredients . emporio is not taking the time and effort to live up to the buzz . i was expecting good , solid , rustic italian food . instead , we got a mixed-up , disappointing lineup of foods . rustic ? well , maybe . good ? no . 
this was our first time here and it was disappointing . first , there really isn ' t much ambience and the room is pretty bland looking . we could also hear every conversation at every table in the big room . we ordered a pitcher of red sangria that was very weak and tasted watered down at N it was well overpriced . we started with shrimp ajio and there were six over-cooked shrimp in a not very garlicy tasting sauce . we figured the paella dela casa was a good bet , but again were disappointed . first i thought paella was made with saffron rice , not regular white rice . not here . also the paella didn ' t have a lot of depth of flavor . it was pretty bland for paella . we ' ve gotten spoiled over the years eating at don pepe ' s in pine brook and newark . this doesn ' t hold a candle . we ' ll have to see if we can find another spanish restaurant in the area . 
tiny and dirty ! 
good service . great cozy atmosphere . good ( but not amazing ) food . busy place . 
love this place ! ! ! love the location , love the atmosphere and the decor , love the food , just love it ! try the rum bowl for N . 
every couple of years , i need to remind myself why i don ' t frequent sally ' s apizza . it ' s not to say that the pizza is not sublime , which it is it ' s just that it seems easier to get into heaven than to snag a sally ' s table on a friday night . we made the circle around wooster street on a warm , end-of-summer friday night , continuing the tradition of post parent-teacher conference abeetz . seeing noone in line at sally ' s at N N , we figured that we would give it a shot . i didn ' t remember the last time something similar happened . by the time we parked , and got into line , there was one couple ahead of us . N N , and the wait begins . now i know that there are not too many tables here , but it was N N before the couple ahead of us got in . luckily , the comedy club across the street has drinks available , and the necessary restroom , should you find a need for either . our line-mates were friendly , and commiserated with us as we watched some people come in for pick-up orders , and back-door table snatchings . one family close behind us had four generations waiting for dinner , including a ninety something ggma , who apparently had been in line since sally ' s opened in N . N N , and we are escorted to our table . seriously . two tables were turned over from the line in an hour and a half . now i understand that the place only opened at N N , and all tables were filled at once . but let ' s assume N tables . let ' s also assume that the oven only fits one pizza at a time , and each table ordered two pizzas . we can also guess that N tables came in from the back door , and N pizzas were picked up . how ' s your math ? let ' s say that N pizzas were made before we sat down . that ' s a pizza every two minutes , and i shouldn ' t be complaining about the line . of course , the oven holds more than one pizza , though you wouldn ' t guess it . my only explanation is that not only did they not turn the oven on until N N , but that they started making the dough then too . so the friendly waiter drops off menus and comes back in a couple of minutes to take our order . thinking ahead , we each order two beverages , remembering that we won ' t see this guy again until the pizza is dropped off . time check N N . ( insert time passing sound effect ) N N- pizzas arrive . ( cue the gluttony ) of course , they have to be good . why else would we waste our lives waiting for these stupid things . there is nothing i could write that can convince you to eat or not to eat these . i love it . the three of us ( including a Nnd grader ) ordered N pizzas . small red with mozz . medium white w fresh tomato . medium red all onion , half bacon , half sausage . ( w mozz ) the first two pies came about N minutes before the last , and were almost completely gone by the time the last one came . there were only N small survivors . N N , and we are presented the check . as i go up to pay , i wonder to myself if i would wait in line after i was done if i was able to get the pizza first . probably not , since i wouldn ' t finish the expedition that sally ' s ending on a good note , like it did tonight . 
i am a big fan of veggie heaven , its simply the best vegan chinese ever hands down ! ! ! ! the food and service are always at the highest level , they truly value their customers . i have been going there for the last N years and have never been let down , i think they strive to have a good repport with their customers always making you feel like family . i cannot say enough how good the food is , and the coconut blueberry vegan cake is a must ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i love this place and it also has another location in denville that is owned and operated by the same family , veggie heaven is a golden gem ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
simple , cheap , filling and delicious ! 
this was a fantastic visit . the food was delicious with plenty of vegetarian options too . we stopped for lunch and the server was very kind and made some suggestions because my friend did not know what to order . the food arrived beautifully plated and was equally tasty . i would highly recommend either a lunch of dinner visit . they have some tables not a lot but , still worth the wait if you were to have to . 
i have been going here for their lunch buffet for years . the food is tasty and they always have a great selection . even my kids love it . 
allergy friendly ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i ' m a veggie with nut , egg , and shellfish allergies . typically i ' m great with just a cucumber avacado roll , but when i explained that to the server she insisted on letting the chef have more fun . certainly , i was relieved , b c this is a top-notch sushi place so i was excited to be able to try the best of the best , despite my allergies ! the chef made me veggie tempora rolls ( no egg in the batter ! ) , a veggie roll with tomato , greens and others , and a new favorite with avocado and strawberry topping drizzled in honey . before getting to work he was sure to clean and sterilize the boards and knife blades to be sure there were no remains of nuts or shellfish , without me even asking ! anyone with allergies , rest assured at umai umai , they will take care of you ! be sure to bring an allergy card with you though , i know that really helped the chef know everything that was totally safe to ' play ' with . i can ' t wait to go back ! 
best jamaican i ' ve ever had . the medium is N meals - not just government approved food pyramid meals but obnoxiously oversized american he-man meals . god help you if you get large , i can only assume it ' s enough for a small family , specifically chris farley ' s family , may he rest in peace . the jerk chicken and brown stew chicken are both excellent and tendah the former had my big jewish nose running from the heat . the sides really make the meal though , so let me help you out by ranking what i ' ve gotten N . rice beans ( i usually try not to wast stomach space on fillers , but this has outstanding flavor with some zing ) N . mac cheese N . cabbage N . collards ( best collards i ' ve ever had , not too bitter ) they were out of potatoes and plantains when i went ( winter ) . this place is popular so go sometime not between N-N or call in your order ( even though they probably won ' t pick up ) . the lady is really nice , but you gotta understand if she doesn ' t seem that way when it ' s busy . the yelp location is wrong - they really set up on Nth , south of spring garden , along the west side of the street . google says N n Nth . just ask someone dummy . 
my post-concert go-to place for a slice or N . great pie for over N years . i know it ' ll be hot it ' ll be good . a slice of cheese , a slice of mushroom . heaven ! 
i ' ve lived in nyc for over Nyrs , and it took that long to get a table at this famous little cafe , but i was able to snag a window seat last monday afternoon at N N . . . and it was worth the wait . yes , the staff is a bit overworked ( translation somewhat slow-- ) , and yes , it ' s expensive-- but man , those caramelized onions with the potatoes that accompanied my lox eggs benedict were truly tasty . when eating out , i often end up wondering why i ' m paying anything for such tasteless food , but that ' s not the case at tartine this is not just a hot spot in the village--it ' s a culinary delight . . . kind of what i would call " down-home gourmet . " plus , the coffee is perfect strong with body , but not bitter ( and they know what you mean when you ask for half n ' half ) . there are a lot of diners in this city that are cheap and easy , but if you want a memory ? tartine is worth the investment of and energy . . . . 
the overall restaurant experience is enjoyable but not time consuming . it is the perfect combination of greek favorites such as gyro as well as salads , which are inevitably sweeping the nation with growing popularity . some may find the french fries added to the sandwiches odd , however in greece at the small mom and pop souvlaki stands , where the original gyro was created , you will find a small portion of potatoes in the tzatziki sauce . 
extremely good service for a coffee house in queens . the staff was extremely inviting and friendly . always there to ask if you wanted more water or coffee . the grilled cheese sandwiches are good but a tad bit expensive for a grilled cheese sandwich . the tomato soup was excellent and fresh tasting . i love the atomsphere but the expensive food and only taking cash at the moment garders it N stars . 
got bad food poisoning from the catfish and or tartar sauce . you might want to avoid them if you go . . . as for me , i won ' t be returning . 
i ' ve been here a few times and i recommend the garbage trucks pizza , nasty sounding i know but wait till you see what ' s on the monster ! there ' s gotta be at least N toppings on it from veggies to sausage and pepperoni to multiple kinds of cheeses ! it ' s super tasty and can feed quite a few people . oh and the cheese fries are delish . steak-style fries with real cheddar melted on top , none of that fake cheese garbage . 
the people that run and own this place are very rude and nasty ! i will not ever nor will any family or friends go to this pizza place . . . . . . they don ' t deliver to my house but they deliver down the street ? does that make any sense ? . . . . i called and placed an order about an hour passed so i called and asked was it on it ' s way , the person on the other end was very rude and nasty and stated that i gave them the wrong address , why the fk would i give another address besides my own ? then he rudely stated oh we don ' t deliver to that area and hung up on me , meanwhile my kids were waiting to eat . even when you go in to place an order they are nasty and sarcastic and rude . gencarelli ' s sucks ! 
keep your expectations low for the food , and go for the atmosphere ( if you are looking for a trendy nolita spot ) . would recommend drinks and ordering at the bar to nibble on . tofu curry , lentil sald , pea soup , and mahi-mahi all mediocre at best . 
great place for drinks and pub fare . loved the wine selection and jerk chicken skewers ( fries were good as well ) . i also quite like the music - at a good level . . . not too loud , not too soft . i ' d recommend going here with friends for drinks and a good bite to eat . staff very friendly . 
i love everything about union jack ' s . the employees are super friendly and upbeat every time i ' m in there . the " cor blimey " with fried pickles and chipotle sauce ( a staff recommendation when i didn ' t know what i wanted ) may be the best sandwich i ' ve ever eaten . as far as i ' m concerned , the best sandwich shop in burlington if you factor in the friendly service , delicious food , reasonable pricing and ease of parking . 
great place to come for a date night . sangria is super strong and delicious and comes in a huge glass . brussel sprouts are phenomenal and the short ribs are one of the tastiest i ' ve ever had . avoid the paella - it ' s just not good . highly reccommend this place . 
the chocolate spumoni ice is what draws me since i was a teenager . no one has chocolate spunmoni . no one . 
this place gives jersey dinners a bad reputation by not providing good food in a friendly setting . some how on our order , someone within the staff didn ' t process the complete order and things had to be ordered again and at that point we removed the item from the order . then my daughter was not eating her egg whites . i tried them and they were sour . i figured they were the carton egg whites . when i confronted the waitress she confirmed they are not from fresh eggs . i asked them to be taken from the bill and she said the manager was upset that because the other food was taken from the bill could i ask him . he would not take the sour eggs from the bill since he lost money from the other food being taken off and the eggs weren ' t sour . the eggs were , the other food was never served and i will not eat or recommend this place to anyone . if you have a problem with your meal they will not correct it as they didn ' t with us . 
totally disgusting . . . . . . 
sunny zen enviornment and simple , excellent food at reasonable prices . rice balls , soups and teas are especially excellent . i wish i lived here . 
i believe service and the way you are treated is as important as the food . i went here on an off night by myself and was about to sit in one of the two empty seats at the bar . the hostess told me i couldn ' t sit there because she had a reservation for two coming in to sit in those bar stools . there were at least N empty tables that i saw so there was room for two to sit at a table . i have eaten here before and like the food , but to start reserving bar stools ( or pretending to be ) is not only pretentious but rude . this place doesn ' t warrant that type of behavior and i will probably be going to the great number of places near there that are just as good if not better . . 
good solid tuna salad hoagie . hit the spot ! order it with lettuce , tomato , onion , and pickle . you won ' t be sorry . bread is pretty good . service is ok but they have an N limit for cc . pickles are yummy ! 
when i first went to bayou , i had really high hopes . to start off , their drink the " coleman " will get you smashed , so drink slowly . i believe the food to be hit or miss . there seems to be andouille sausage in everything . the food isn ' t bad , it ' s just okay . desserts are great , though ! the place is worth a try , just don ' t expect it to be the best food you ' ve ever had . but i guess it would be nice to eat something other than penne vodka once in a while , right ? 
the service takes this place up to a N . exacting attention without being overbearing . feeling taken care of is something that has become increasingly uncommon as many restaurants focus on their food and neglect service . if anything is not to your liking , anything at all , everyone here will ensure that it is made right . the food and cocktails are quite good . primarily peruvian as far as i can tell . not a huge fan of their corn and mushrooms but that ' s personal preference . 
my fave place in the area . amazing food with fresh ingredients , reasonably priced and old timey cocktails that will get you wasted in no time . and if you do have to wait longer for a table than assumed they make up for it with the best olives and bread to snack on . yumedy-yum-yum . 
this place is really freaking good . came by the other week with a friend when we were a bit famished from too much shopping . all the other cute cafe type places were full and we decided to wander in here on a whim . . absolutely no regrets . it was delicious . i had a salad and a chicken panini . my friend had the salad with huge delicious slices of mozzarella on top and a pasta ( don ' t remember the name . . sorry ! ) . the service was really fast , and friendly . will be back for sure . 
this place is fantastic . one of the best places to eat italian food in philadelphia . i didn ' t think it could get any better , until i learned that tuesday nights are byob night ! woohoo ! 
i was there with five and a baby for a thursday night dinner , its was wonderful we all enjoyed the food the baby samon and she loved it i was shock i loved the pork dish that was my favorite , the iticha salad was delicious and my wife was great with the meal , dessert was very good too creme brulee and a raspberry cream sublime . i will be going back for brunch to try iveher its good . 
pro there ' s something very authentic about this place and the food is honest . they serve hot tea while you wait for a table ! had a really interesting experience with the sea urchin ( which i love ) in fish broth jelly ( which i found questionable ) . they have a pretty solid tempura soba . i like that they put the tempura on a separate plate so its not soggy when it gets to your table . try the wasabi ice cream . con a little pricey for the portions . 
superb food , friendly service , great ambiance and the best smoked bluefish roulette i ' ve ever tasted . an extensive selection of wine as well ( i recommend the vin de pays du vaucluse ) . move over applebee ' s , there ' s a new sheriff in town . 
does anyone not notice how mean they are there ? 
the original , and still superior to the others in the city ( looking at you , williamsburg ) . place is packed and chaotic at times . make sure to keep your receipt . note the dumplings here are ok , but you ' d do much better at prosperity dumplings a block or two south . 
not bad ramen . i ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the chasu pork . i can ' t really comment on the authenticity but i enjoyed the broth and noodles . the pork was quite good too . the extra egg was marinated and cut in half and was good too . i had the tempura as well for an appetizer and the batter was light and crisp too . service was prompt unlike some of the earlier reviews so it sounds like the initial opening pains have been dealt with . the music was loud and annoying however . this place is a good addition to the neighborhood and i ' ll be back for sure . i haven ' t tried any of the other ramen places in philly yet for comparison however . 
love their new location ( more space ! ! ! ) and the expanded menu . hand drawn noodles are a must for the cooler months , but their noodles and their spicy beef tendons appetizer are so yummy that i find myself craving it even in the midst of summer ! so if after all this time , you still haven ' t tried hand drawn or hand shaved noodles . . . . please . . . just go now ! ! ! ! 
this place is right around the corner from us , and we ' ve eaten there N times since moving here a little over a month ago . i ' ve had pepe ' s pizza as well , and i have to say , john and maria ' s is right up there with them . delicious crispy crust , sloppy sauce , fresh mozz , if you ' re a pizza person ( and i am ) , you ' ll love it here . the margherita is excellent , as is the mama mia . my wife has also gotten some of the non-pizza dishes , and said they were excellent as well . 
this is my " go to " restaurant . i ' m quite lucky to have it around the corner from where i live . every family event of mine is held here and the staff couldn ' t be more professional . i have suggested this place to many people and they all feel the same as me . 
i recently had lunch there . mango juice was in a can . couldn ' t they pour it on a glass to make it more presentable . dumpling soup was above average and had a strong celery flavor , which made it a non-filipino soup . bipstik or beef onions stew was bad . it looked like bipstik but didn ' t taste or smell line one . i would still go back and try the others , again , with a critical sense of taste and smell . just avoid their bipstik . 
the ramen was great . the wait was terrible . i passed by alone and asked the guy at the door how long was the wait . there were about N people waiting . he said that it will be quick because i was just N person . ok . i waited about N min . most people who came before me were gone . anticipating that my turn was coming soon , i noticed that he called someone definitely came after me . i asked the guy if he called me . he said no . after the Nnd time someone who came after me was called , i told the guy i was here before them . he said that it has to be N people . the same thing happened at least for the next N pairs . at the point , i waited for N hour total and at least N pairs of people who came after me went in . when i finally was seated ( after a single person left ) , i was furious . it must be visible because the manager in the counter who cheerfully greeted me asked me what was wrong . i told him what happened . he apologized and told me that the guy at the door was new and he was going to talk to him later . he offered me beer or sake . i declined since i don ' t drink . he gave me a small dish of appetizer and gave me a can of hot tea when i left . yes it was a freezing cold night . the ramen was delicious . i think that the manager made sincere efforts to make me feel better . otherwise , i would have given N star and was never going back . i would have been fine if the guy told me that he may not be able to seat me soon because i was alone or if it were just N or N pairs went in before me . i was alone and looking for a quick bite . i probably was in the store for less than N min . some pairs could be still ordering . i would go back if i have a company ( seems like a pair has the best chance to get in with least amount of wait ) and if someone else is at the door . 
everything here is from spain and the atmosphere is of a cool wine bar meets grocery store . the have authentic spanish meats , treats and everything in between . the sandwiches in the back are excellent and absolutely worth it as well as the fresh desserts . loved the sausage and tapas . the service was quick and nice . a bit small but you still can enjoy the food . it was a bit pricey , but it ' s worth the money you spend . 
sushi was decent and it is acceptable , but since we are in the city , there are better places to go to . the price seems decent , at N pieces per roll for approximately N . N . they have a few specialty rolls that was good . service was great , especially our waiter when we needed a good recommendation on sake . ( " thick and chewy " sake , only with his recommendation would anyone pick this sake from its description - - ) they have great ambiance as well , the night we went , they had surprisingly a lot of birthdays doing around with their lighting torch candle . great service , decent sushi . i may go back to check out their karaoke upstairs . recommending to other people wise , if you are in the area , sure , try it out . 
great pizza . . . . after you walk the brooklyn bridge , there might be a long line but stick it out and wait for this pizza . it will be well worth the wait ! 
a great little deli ! what i really love about them is their sandwiches , especially the " george ' s hero " . if you can get past the fact that it ' s named after bush long enough to order it you ' ll be in heaven ! i don ' t know what they do to this sandwich , but it ' s so effing good ! i can tell you the components , but it doesn ' t do it justice roast beef , marinated red peppers , cheese and arugula served warm on a roll . see what i mean ? you ' ll just have to try it . never tried the " bloomburga " , but it ' s on my list just for the name alone . oh , and they have cute little fresh squeezed ojs for a dollar and they ' re friendlier than most other delis , too . 
 restaurant week review damn , this place came to play . what better way to handle restaurant week than to let your guests select one thing from each category on your menu ? the deal was crazy . for two people N apps N cold N satay N meat N fish N side N desserts sampan ftw started with hamachi ceviche and pork bao buns . both were delicious . the ceviche was served on two small spoons and had lots of fresh tangly flavor . lamb satay and rock shrimp came next . lamb satay definitely had me cleaning the chop with my teeth and the rock shrimp was tossed with a sriracha aioil . beautiful . roasted duck with wontons and miso glazed salmon . these were incredible but we were a bit too full to truly enjoy them . they definitely came home with us . the foam on top of the duck might have been one of the best things i ' ve ever tasted . kimchi fried rice . served with a fried egg on top . so delicious . mini shrimp mixed throughout . also came home with us . i ' ll be nomming on it later today . dessert two mini ice cream cones . raspberry vanilla and chocolate mint oreo . perfect size and just the right amount of sweetness . awesome wait staff and a great restaurant layout . i love the open kitchen and the looping movie quotes in the bathroom . this is a great restaurant . what more can you ask for ? 
yay ! burlington finally has a great taqueria ! it ' s called " el cortijo " and it occupies the downtown space at N bank street where katz ' s deli used to be . started by the owners of " the farmhouse tap grill " which is just a few blocks away , el cortijo does something that ' s not very difficult , but has eluded all previous attempts at mexican eateries in town ( and up until very recently , in the state ) - it serves delicious mexican-style food you will gladly eat on a weekly basis . hell , i was just there a few nights ago for dinner and i ' m going back in a few days for lunch . up until the opening of el cortijo , if burlingtonians wanted to eat delicious , authentic mexican food they had to make the N-minute drive to frida ' s taqueria grill in stowe . before that , the mexican food in the state resembled mexican food only in the vaguest of ways . a hard sell for people who have lived in major cities or been lucky enough to visit mexico . as much as i love el cortijo some do not . there are a few reasons for this N . el cortijo pretty much only serves tacos . there are now burritos on the menu and a few other offerings , but not the wide variety of tamales , chimichangas , quesadillas and other foods typical associated with mexican restaurants . el cortijo stretches its menu a bit for brunch on weekends , adding N or N other dishes , including a corn pancake and huevos divorciados . cortijo also offers ceviche , queso fundido and a few other appetizers to it ' s taco offering . so , go to el cortijo knowing you will get great drinks , an awesome assortment of fresh tacos ( including amazing fish tacos , al pastor , chorizo , beef , chicken , as well as other meat and a great assortment of veggie tacos ) , and a few other food items , but will not find the wide assortment of offerings that you often see in other mexican restaurants . N . some complain that el cortijo is expensive a few of the locals i ' ve spoken with don ' t like el cortijo because each taco costs about N . i ' ve never been able to comfortably eat more than N ( along with guacamole and chips , etc ) . the drinks are about N . if this is way out of your price category , beware . but for those of us who love the food , paying N for lunch or dinner ( not including drinks ) is perfectly reasonable . el cortijo is a great place for foodies or people that appreciate high-quality , local ingredients . case in point . . . the last time i had brunch at el cortijo i had a N cheese quesadilla , containing goat , sheep and cow cheese , accented with pickled jalapenos and toasted pepitas ( pumpkin seeds ) nestled between N soft , organic corn tortillas ( made fresh on site ) . really amazing . i also had a chorizo and a fish taco . both were delicious and so far above the other tacos in town , it almost seems unfair . but not quite . i was sort of surprised to find that the guacamole at el cortijo is actually better than frida ' s ( previously located in stowe before it closed in N ) used to be . at frida ' s they made it fresh at your table with a pestle . el cortijo ' s guacamole contains huge , soft ( but not mushy ) chunks of avocado . it ' s made every morning instead of on the spot . despite this , i like it better . i ' ve been waiting for simple , delicious , low-cost , city-quality mexican food in vermont for N years . it ' s finally here . thanks el cortijo . burlington owes you one . 
this was my second time coming back to maggie mcfly ' s and i will definitely be back a third ! the food was delicious , and our waitress was great . really enjoyed the atmosphere and i love what they did with the inside , great new look ! maggie mcfly ' s is definitely worth checking out , you won ' t be dissapointed ! 
i love this place ! ! ! i really liked the service . very great , excellent fast service , very friendly staff and a lot of pleasant things . i will come back to you again ! ! ! 
i created my yelp account in order to give gaia a five-star review . the food is too delicious , the entire staff is too friendly , and the prices are too reasonable not to add extra praise to their already glowing reputation . gaia is so good it might put yelp out of business because there ' s no longer a need to search around for a place to eat . the perfect answer is always gaia . 
it ' s true that the new rudy ' s is missing the atmosphere the old joint created throughout the years ( and that it ' s colorful matinee crowd ) , but the new rudy ' s is excellent . it ' s slowly building up its new cred . beer selection is very good and the waiters really know their stuff , so they can help you decide or simply get acquainted with it . food menu is far better than it was at the old place . fries are still there ( although they charge now for their sauces -i don ' t remember it being that way before- ) . bucket of mussels is huge and delicious . wings , burgers and the roasted beet salad are always my top choices . 
a friend told me about this place and i had some doubts because it has been a while since i had good authentic cuisine . . . when my fiance and i went there for dinner we were so extremely pleased that we even made it a destination for my mothers birthday ! great food and fun atmosphere . if you like your sangria strong , be sure you bring a bottle of wine to add to it . theirs was good but not strong at all . 
i tried to place an order over the phone this evening and decided to change the order at end of my conversation with person who was taking it ( who happened to be one of the owners ) and he basically hung up on me once he heard the word " cancel " - he didn ' t even let me finish my sentence . that is no way to treat a repeat customer - there is no excuse for bad customer service . 
best chicken and ribs in the galaxy this place is getting busier and busier every week . everything i have had here has been outstanding and very affordable . i must go every week now even though i have to drive one hour . 
i give this place five stars because the food is authentic malaysian . this is my go-to place when i crave good malaysian food in the city . this place accepts cash only , so be prepared . there are chase atms closeby , however ( use your smartphone ! ) . the service is only average , which is not surprising for a chinatown establishment . i usually get the nasi lemak here ( my favorite malaysian dish ! ) . the only complaint i have is they won ' t replace the chicken with tofu or egg . this dish is really for those who love spicy dishes with anchovies . the sambal here is great , although they do charge N for an additional bowl . my friends who come with me usually get the hainanese chicken , a staple for malaysian street food , and the roti canai as an appetizer . i love nyonya and will definitely be back many more times ! 
eh it ' s ok . i couldn ' t find the place for the life of me ! finally found it . place is smaller than smaller . i couldn ' t find a menu . had to ask for a menu . you should have menus out for customers to look at . i asked the girl behind the counter about how many bones were on the rib sandwich and she yelled back to the guy because she had no clue ! i asked what meat was in the greens and she didn ' t know . i asked her more questions and all she did was tell back and ask because she didn ' t know . that ' s a horrible sign ! you need to know what your selling . i asked for a receipt and she didn ' t even know how to do that either . the place was a little dirty too . there was grease coming out of the machine in the ceiling where the equipment was . it was kind of nasty ! the ribs had no flavor whatsoever and the sauce was way too sweet , the greens weren ' t fresh and were way too bitter . i found N bones in the greens which i almost swallowed ! the beans were terrible and mushy and all clumped together . the cornbread was very dry ! lastly i asked for extra sauce on the side when my order came up and she again had to ask the guy if they had extra sauce . the guy told me they don ' t have extra bbq sauce and he put enough on the ribs . i like extra sauce on the side . how does a bbq place not have extra sauce on the side ? ? ? 
the premier afghan restaurant in philly , few places can give this joint a run for its money . 
faced with a choice of waiting an hour and a half for a table in the dining room or taking a high table sans chairs shoved in the waiting bar area , we opted for the latter . these tables presented just about the least comfortable dining situation i ' ve ever encountered . the tables were so close together that only one group of two could stand facing each other , and one person was left abutting the substantial and ever-growing crowd gathered around the bar and waiting for tables . it took a while for us to get menus despite securing the table so quickly . our perfectly pleasant waitress was helpful in explaining how the menu worked . i opted for the spicy pork meatballs in classic tomato sauce over rigatoni . the portion was substantial ( i wish you could order fewer than four balls if you choose to have them over a pasta greens as opposed to one of the sandwich choices ) . the pork was juicy with a nice kick to it and did not require the spicy meatsauce to enhance it . the pasta was perfectly al dente , and the flat breadstick was very fresh . it took us a really long time to get our check as there didn ' t seem to be that many servers working . i didn ' t get to try any of the wines or tempting-sounding ice cream sandwiches on this visit , so i will have to try them on a return visit if i can abide the crowds and slow service . 
food good , service good , atmosphere good ! if i never had to worry about calories ever again i would eat brunch here every weekend . the fried chicken and mac n ' cheese sandwich is worth the mess you make . 
i ' ve been there twice in two weekends . appetizers are all amazingly fresh . their horitaki salad is great with sweet tomatoes . perfectly balanced dressing . . . not acidic . three dip appetizer is great . gigantes beans are nice with the honey-tomato sauce . branzino and salmon entrees are superb . lamb shank is rich . no room for dessert ! the ambiance is relaxing and service was superb . my friends loved it as much as i did . still raving . not a cheap dinner but not the most costly in the city . worth every dollar ! best to eat earlier in the evening . make a reservation . 
love burgers of this place ! 
this has been my favorite sushi restaurant ever since we first discovered them a few years ago . staff is incredibly friendly and sushi is top notch . they mostly do take out , but do have a few tables for dine-in . i highly recommend dining in , as your bound to be treated to something special during your meal . we often get to sample a special roll , or get mochi for dessert . i highly recommend the sunflower roll which i order every time at takei . 
this is just as amazing as everyone says . if you want good , interesting thai food that doesn ' t remind you of every other dish you usually get at other restaurants , this is your spot . the menu is big and full of unique options as well as expert renditions of old faves , and everything tastes fresh , vibrant , and carefully prepared . they don ' t skimp on the nice ingredients- expect big , chewy pieces of tofu and huge chunks of bamboo shoots . that ' s probably the best thing about pure . the service is acceptable , and the staff will keep you satisfied with ice-cold carafes of water as fast as you can drink them and will accommodate your demands for spices and menu adjustments . this is a good place to bring your friends who are vegans vegetarians gluten free food allergies , etc . , because they were very helpful to us in dealing with special dietary considerations . obvious words of warning the place is tiny and gets way crowded . the earlier you go , the greater your chances of getting seated and not being smooshed up against people who can ' t stop saying how " authentic " this place is ( which , admittedly , it totes is ) . this spot is so good that it ' s worth going a little out of your way to come here . yes , i know there are N , N thai restaurants on Nth avenue- but this one stands out and is worth going out of your way for ! 
tiffany ' s is my go-to place for a good meal and drinks . the kitchen is open late and this is why we end up here so often . we usually sit at the bar and try to get there during the second round of happy hour which is from N N-N N . they have a variety of apps and drinks that are N . good selection of beers on tap too . friday nights are usually live music and saturday nights usually feature ufc or boxing or sports . the staff is very friendly and always have good suggestions on new things to try . all of the food is great . i especially like the penne vodka with chicken , boneless thai wings , fried mozzarella triangles , and grilled chicken sandwich ( blackened ) . the ribs are good especially on wednesday when they are buy one get one free ( and you can take the second one home ) . for sides , the home made potato chips are nice or the baked mac n cheese which has the yummy cornbread on top . they have a very cool lounge downstairs for parties which i have only been in one time . it was a dance club at one point but that didn ' t last long . the outdoor patio is a very nice place to chill in the summer nights . 
very good at the thai staples -- great curry and noodles ( especially the spicy flat noodles ) . one major disappointment is the calamari they use -- it doesn ' t seem particularly fresh , it ' s shaped like fusilli pasta and is always very tough chewy -- and the individual pieces are so large you want to cut them , but since thai restaurants do not usually provide knives , you have to carve at it with your spoon or fork . but , if you avoid the calamari , you will be happy . 
overpriced - slow service - waiter smelled like a brewery - would never go back . . . stay away from this place . . . 
the mohitos are excellent and the sushi is good , but the service is somewhat slow . overall i truly enjoy eating here , particularly upstairs where the ambiance is warmly exuberant and very comfortable . 
cachapas ! la del gato ! queso guayanes in the states ! somos felices ) 
went there last night and got wings to go . the girl said they are known for their wings . hopefully it was an off night . the wings were terrible ! im used to charlies wings down the shore . the wings had no sauce on them and i did not order them that way , when i woke up in the morning the sauce in the container had about N N red sauce on the bottom and rest was orange hard fat on the top . , sorry wont be getting wings there again . 
it ' s basically the worst pizza ever made . but people seem to enjoy burnt cardboard crust , no cheese , and hair in their food . it ' s no wonder there is a long line of fat people who probably are so tired from standing for more than one minute that they rush their food down their throats without anytime to even taste the damn thing . if they had any taste buds , they ' d probably refuse to eat certain foods every once in a while , and maybe they wouldn ' t fall into the obese category of the bmi scale . chew your food , taste it ! this place is gross ! if you actually like the taste of food , j v on Nth ave is the place to go for pizza and any other dough , cheese and sauce related foods . 
a little pricey , but sangria is amazing . once it hits your lips , it ' s so good . i like to come here with the girls every so often just to get some drinks . i ' ve heard good things about the food and there seems to be quite a few good comments about the food here on yelp , so i will have to try it sometime soon and update my review . for now , i like this place for it ' s sangria . 
this is my new " go-to " spot . i have been there a handful times and have never been dissapointed . the ambiance is nice it ' s as though you are eating in someone ' s house small and relatively quiet . service has never disappointed . the waitstaff has an extensive knowledge of their dishes and their recommendations are spot on . my favorites salipcao - by far the best dish they make . the dressing is mayo-based which i feared would be heavy , but not at all . it ' s a great salad to share among the group and has been a hit with everyone group i ' ve had it with . camarones de bobo - a delicious shrimp stew served with potatoes . i ' m not sure what it is but i love this dish . carne asada - another winner . i had it for the first time last week and it may be my new favorite dish . the drinks are great as well . this place is simply a hit on every level . 
food was average . service was horrible . condescending and incompetent wait staff . never felt so demeaned in my life . however , bus boys and other help were very good . if youre looking for a good drink and friendly service i would suggest driving . N miles down the road to la pergola . don ' t waste your time at mediterranean . 
came here around Npm for N - no wait ) i got the gruyere , arugla , and mushroom and my boyfriend got N mushroom type . both dishes were delicious ( i like the mushroom one a little better ) and the breadsticks were very good . small restaurant , friendly staff and overall really tasty risotto - the pizza looked good too ! i am going back ! 
i heart the devil ' s den . with an intimidating beer list , and delicious gastropub comfort food fare , this is the kind of place i like to go when i feel like kicking back with a few new friends . like everyone else has mentioned , the happy hour is just wonderful . grab yourself some top notch craft beer drafts at half price . the cute happy hour tapas are also awesome . my favorite entree is the vegetarian sloppy joe - which as a meat eater , i still very much enjoyed . love the fries and the spicy mayo dip as well . 
perfection attained . . . . well close enough . you ' ll find this new spot kiddie corner from zum schneider , and it ' s bound to pillage a good portion of their business . austrian favorites like schnitzel and wurstz done with attention to detail and a love for the mother country . the service was familiar yet speedy . only complaint was that they didn ' t seem to know what to do with the overflow of guests , including myself . however , my friend and i lucked out with plenty of elbow-room at the copper-topped bar and eugene , the dedicated turkish bartender , at our beck and call . i left with really nothing to get off my chest , and that is a rarity . my one concern is that the rent on my beautiful apartment just up the street is about to go up . great addition to the neighborhood ! 
the food at black bamboo is possibly the best chinese take out i ' ve ever gotten . the food is fresh and not too greasy . . . which is often my complaint about chinese . delicious vegan options too , especially the vegan bbq ribs . every employee i ' ve dealt with has been very pleasant and seems to want me to truly enjoy my experience with their restaurant . my only complaint is that delivery can sometimes take a while however , they are very honest about this and don ' t try to pretend it will be shorter ( on different occassions they have estimated N minutes up to N hours , and each time they were pretty damn exact to their estimates . ) i don ' t plan on ordering from any other chinese restaurant in the area and recommend that you don ' t either . 
the food ' s great . lots of options and ( i think ) it ' s healthy . one time i dropped my smoothie on the way out the door and they gave me a replacement . really nice people . 
great chinese food , as good as any comparable place in frisco or seattle , the ports i used to hang out in . han , the owner , is usually working the tables . i ' ve eaten there twice . it does get busy for dinner . try it for a leisurely lunch . show some courage and intestinal fortitude and go with han ' s recommendations . 
i decided to go and try their breakfast . their sausage taste good , but lao ' s breakfast made from sticky rice , cannot remember the exact name , not that good . 
great ambiance , nice space . friday night , they were able to accomodate my party of N very quickly . their sangria is delicious . chicken pio is okay , i was expecting a little more . papa rellena was an interesting appetizer dish . deep fried mash potato stuffed with meat sauce . lomo saltado was very good . flavorful . camarones cuzcos tastes amazing . the sauce is great with the rice and shrimp . mero con salsa de porto , my favorite dish . amazing chilean sea bass with a nice serving of vegetables . overall , great experience . waiters were all very nice and accommodating . food is great . amazing ambiance . would definitely return . 
 N for an extremely salty , over deep fried schweinshaxen was a poor showing for this german style place . i tried to let tom the waiter know that i was displeased with my meal , but her ran off too fast before i could reply to his question on how my meal was . my previous schweinshaxen at the brauhaus was great ! large , soft , and moist . this was almost a door stop and inedible . the sides of sauerkraut and fried potatoes were good . only N weissen on tap , this was another disappointment . it might be another year or so before i spend this much money if there food quality does not improve significantly . 
oh boy ! my grandson took me here and i had fried chicken with a waffle ? can you image in that ? and it was excellent . i would like for my grandson to take me again . 
commemorating this review not with a focus on food but that i had my first date here with my future husband-to-be . thanks for making our memory . p . s . pancakes good . eggs good . writing on the table good . 
owner of this place deserves five stars for rudeness and is exactly what the customer service should not be . it was embarassing to be talking to with him in front of my family as he is one misfit character for any sort of people facing work . i would strongly recommend that you consider other places and not spoil your evening at this loser of a place . good chance that you will end up hungry and mad after you visit this place . try other indian resturant like mirchi etc on the next block . 
the wait time is usually pretty crazy , however it is a high volume establishment . it is a tad over priced and if you dont speak french you may have a difficult time understanding the menu . so i went with a burger and it was okay but not worth N , shake shacks would have been just as good for half the price ! 
love this place after a long work week , great food and drinks , waiters are personel and happy
came here on friday night with a soon to expire groupon . this is really more like N . N stars i feel bad going all the way down to N though . after seeing the shrimp masala picture here on yelp i knew i needed that . . . . . . . . what a let down . pretty damn small shrimp with no crunch and pretty dry . man did my heart sink when that place came out . i ' ve only gone out for indian few a hand full of times , but one of the times i had a shrimp appetizer at akbar that is on my list of top N thing ' s i ' ve ever eaten . so coming to a new indian restaurant i kind of couldn ' t help but to compare the N appetizers . i would not order this again . the chips with the N sauces were awesome . tamarind sauce is great and helped save the lame shrimp . entree ' s my girlfriend got a lentil and spinach dish that came out looking like a very thick soup . i got the lamb vindaloo that came out looking like a bowl of my parents stew . my girlfriend and i just looked at our food for a minute and started to eat it strait out of the bowls it came in . a minute later the waiter came over and told us to wait for the rice he was bringing out . ahhhh it all made sense suddenly . so i laid down some white rice . i put some of my vindaloo on top the rice and a small spoon of the spinach lentil on the side . we asked for a side bowl of the mint chutney sauce that came with the bread earlier and i added this to the top for a cooling contrast in flavor . it kind of served as my indian guacamole . it was very delicious . when i ordered the waiter asked if i wanted it spicy or not . i said " yes , plenty of spice please " i know they could have made it spicier . . . . oh well . although my meal was good . . . . . like i said earlier it tasted like my parents stew ( after i add hot sauce ) . that was odd being that my mom is colombian and my dad sicilian soooo i don ' t understand how this indian dish tasted like my parents cooking . my girlfriend told me to be happy i liked it , but i was kind of thinking about how i could have just hit up the parents for free . N . N for the girlfriends diet coke can . . . . that ' s kind of crazy . the service at first we had a girl waitress who could answer no questions so she passed off helping us onto a more seasoned gentlemen . my girlfriend and a friend that came with us had been bickering so they were both sitting there all grumpy looking . . . . i was chillin . awkwardly after the waitress got an earful from the waiter ( who i think was the manager ) she came over to our table and asked my girlfriend what was wrong ? does she need something or is something missing ? . . . . . our table was empty and we were waiting for our food so i ' m not sure what would be missing . . . . just kind of waiting . . . oh yea our friend ordered lamb kabob ' s and they came out after my app , but before our entree ' s . the problem was that the naan he ordered didn ' t come out till our entree ' s did so his meat cooled down significantly . he said it was a bit dry . i don ' t think i would return without a groupon or something . ispice is about N min south of my house , . but N min . north is one of the best dish ' s i ' ve ever had at akbar . 
i ' ve been hearing about peaches for the entire year i ' ve lived in the neighborhood and just now made it over there . had i known how good it is , i would have been there first thing . i ' m from the south , so good southern food is important to me . and holy moly is the food delicious . grits grits and more grits . i had a hard time choosing which to get- but i was not disappointed with the broccoli grits . only N and it filled me ! i did have a slice of the cornbread as well , which came out piping hot and fresh . the perfect sweet and salty ratio . i was wishing i had more . i also shared some mac and cheese with my friend and that too was rich and creamy delicious . lastly- try one of their cocktails ! i ' m not a big drinker so one cocktail had me a bit tipsy and it was so so good . ( the rosie p ) i can ' t recommend this place highly enough and i can ' t wait to go back . i went on a friday night so the service wasn ' t super fast but they were busy so i wasn ' t even bothered ! yummmm . 
soup dumplings . its worth the long line , sharing tables with strangers , and feeling cramped . 
best cheesesteak in philly . no flash necessary . geno ' s is for custies . 
the thinnest crust pizza i ' ve ever had . . . delicious toppings ( mushroom , sausage , onion ) . menu was a bit limited and the restaurant was a bit loud for pre-sunset , but we thoroughly enjoyed the pizza ! 
last night ' s dinner exceeded my expectations so much that i created a yelp account for the first time so that i could review this restaurant ! i have been to hen of the wood-waterbury several times , so i knew i was in for a treat . the ambiance of the burlington location is similar but special in it ' s own right . cozy , rustic , clean , modern . . . i really liked the " open kitchen " with bar seating , it was fun to watch while we dined ! ambiance is important for me when i go out to eat , and this restaurant gets N N for that category in particular . our waitress was fantastic , which is something you unfortunately can ' t say for most burlington restaurants . she was incredibly , friendly , warm , fun and knowledgeable . she was attentive and we didn ' t feel rushed at all . our dining experience was definitely improved because of her . there were a lot of staff working , but surprisingly everything seemed to run as a well oiled machine . i was impressed . the food was out of this world , and i am still dreaming of it N hours later . . . the lobster small plate and winter squash crepe large plate were definite favorites . the squash fritters were like tiny fried clouds . the cocktails were also a treat . i was so happy to see a standby favorite " cherry coke " on the menu , only it had been all jazzed up ! the switchel cocktail was also delicious and felt very seasonal . the desserts were fantastic , anything would be worth a try if you have room after dinner . as someone who dines out frequently in burlington , this dinner became my top favorite last night . i really appreciated the fantastic service--a standout for the area . thank you hen of the wood burlington , we will be back soon ! 
it is sad that the mcnally franchise has sunk so low . food and service is fine . but the clientele was truly low . flip flops ? shorts ? golf hats ? new yorkers , don ' t bother . even the euro tourists would be preferable . we left with an unpleasant taste in our mouths . 
i never review a anywhere , but my visit just now called for one . the first inclination that we were in for a bad time was the fact that the parking lot was empty . we arrived at Npm on a monday night and no one was in the restaurant . my fianc wanted split pea soup and after calling N diners , this is who had it . we sat down looked at the menu and were surprised to see that the dinner special prices were good so we decided on getting the teriyaki pork chop and a cheesesteak meal . shortly after , the waitress came to say they were out of pork chops and to choose something else , so we ordered a chicken entree . when the soup and salad came out , it had onions and tomatoes on it , which i specifically said i didn ' t want . that was the second strike after not having the pork chop . finally our entrees came out . the first bite of the chicken entree came with a huge vein through it . my fianc refused to eat it after that . as i was eating my cheesesteak a piece of what i thought was onion fell out . i looked at it and noticed it was a piece of fat from the steak with no meat attached just fat . i appreciate that they slice up the steak , but i didn ' t enjoy a piece of fat sitting there . we called the waitress over about the chicken because i didn ' t want to complain about both meals . we told her about the chicken and she said " oh well it ' s chicken it has veins . " she then went onto say that ' s why she doesn ' t eat chicken with bones and never saw a vein in a cutlet . after a little going back and forth the point was made that we didn ' t want the chicken or anything else to replace it . the waitress then comes and drops off the check which they took the chicken off , but they charged the whole price for the cheesesteak even though they did not serve the dessert that the dinner special was supposed to have for the cheesesteak . even if i wanted to finish the cheesesteak i felt like i had no choice but to leave because they just dropped the check off ! never will i go back here ? so many other diners don ' t waste your money here ! 
food tasted terrible bed , i think chicken was old , i couldn ' t eat it and i left , i use to go there every month and before i never had such a bed experience but after last time im never will go back again . 
great place , very authentic . la normande is delicious ! ! also tried l ' orientale and was very good . friendly staff and relatively quick service . 
the place is beautiful , my girlfriend likes there . the food , for me not any special ! the service , not bad ! but they almost don ' t wait our appetizer finish , then the main dish came ! this point i don ' t like . and also didn ' t pour us wine and the wine glass is not glasses ! the price , be conclusion , not worth it ! 
what is there to say about joe ' s other than their food is the best in town ! ! scratch that , the best i ' ve ever had . joe ' s is a staple restaurant and deli for my family . i frequently order their subs and salads for lunch and so do my coworkers . i also have catered with them for many occasions . my family and i have been loyal customers before they added and expanded the restaurant . the restaurant food is phenomenal ! ! you get a huge portion for the price . i love seafood and go crazy for their zuppi di pesce dish and tilapia dishes . every friday night my husband is ready to go at Npm to have dinner at joe ' s , and makes sure to always order the zuppi di pesce and house fried calamari . most importantly , joe ' s is a family business . they make you feel like family and are the greatest group of guys . the guys there , joe , john , vin , rocco , are the most welcoming people . they know their customers by name and make sure we all have a great experience . if you haven ' t tried their food- you must , you won ' t be disappointed ! 
this is a great restaurant in terms of food but i do think it is overpriced . and the lady that answered the phone when i called was a bit snobby and unprofessional which rubbed me in the wrong direction . they charge N a person to cut a cake for you if you bring in your own cake for an occasion - N per slice , thats an insult to my intelligence ! otherwise i would give this place N stars . 
really good place for seafood . came here on tuesday . the wait time was about ten minutes , not bad at all for a very popular spot in manhattan . the servers was fast and attentive . they have excellent customer service skills , friendly , polite and knowledgeable . the food was definitely top notch stuff . we ordered oysters , very fresh . the crab legs were meaty and delicious . the blacken catfish sandwich was so good that my boyfriend ordered a second one . if you crave for some delicious seafood , this would be the place for it . 
solid falafel sandwiches . good for lunch time fare in this area . 
better than pat ' s , but steve ' s prince of steaks is by far the best steak in philly - now open in center city . 
tasty neighborhood thai place . good red curry , which is my baseline for good thai food . also good tom ka gai . 
great place for a unique burger ! you should try all of them ! ! 
i began coming here back in N or N when i lived in the neighborhood . it is the perfect place to come alone and enjoy a huge steaming cup of pleasure ( whatever yours may be ) and a gooey desert crepe . or for dinner introduce your friends to this quaint little restaurant that you have loved for years just to find out that they ' ve all known about the place and have been coming for years too ! ! ! love it ! the last time i went there with a friend it was fantastic . usually i go for their crepes but we decided to go for the escargo and two different musssel plates . all were amazing and paired with a bottle of their sancerre . it gets pretty crowded and loud but in a cozy manner where i could still enjoy conversation with a friend . the staff is friendly but sometimes rushed . 
worst service in chinatown for ok food . chinatown service is usually efficient - ( fast , no small talk , etc . i can deal with it ) . but the waitstaff here was downright rude - ( i ' ve been here a few times but this was definitely the last ) . the waitress was absurdly aggresive and antagonistic to my family . in all my years of eating in chinatown - this was hands down the worst service ever ( and that ' s quite a statement , haha ) . what kind of establishment allows their waitstaff to scowl and yell at patrons when they ' re putting in an order ? it was super weird and super rude - apparently we didn ' t order enough food ? we don ' t know- either way , it was uncalled for . all in all , the food is decent chinese fast food - but not worth the stomach churning service . not worth it to ruin your visiting out-of-town family ' s meal with waitstaff who give you attitude it ' s worth it to trek a few extra blocks to congee bowery or congee village ( most of my hk friends agree that this is less touristy - albeit less centrally located - and the food is better quality and less expensive ) from now on . better selection of authentic chinese dishes , efficient ( though still not entirely friendly - but not rude either ) service , and better congee ( great consistency , lower price too ) , solid won ton noodle soup . 
great tacos . i don ' t know why people want to compare dos toros with chipotle its just so much better . i eat here at least once a week since its close to work and i ' m never disapointed
i eat pizza from all N boroughs and had most of the " big name " pizzas on staten island . denino ' s is by far the best on s . i . up there with the best in nyc . the only reason i didn ' t give N stars is because i am more of a sauce based pizza person and denino ' s is more cheese based . it ' s preference . this pizza is great ! 
the amazing food and good ambiance ( if a little loud and limited a c ) make this a great brunch dinner option . but what really sets Nleaves apart is the service . in my opinion at least , it ' s the gold standard in williamsburg . wait times tend to be long , but they give you a good estimate of how long it ' s going to be . they do a great job of moving people through at a solid clip , but they don ' t make you feel rushed or prodded . they manage to be attentive despite how crazy it is . i ' ve been here over a dozen times and have never had a bad experience . 
i am giving this place N stars just because it ' s a very beautiful restaurant . food is overpriced . . . i left feeling no value for my experience and everyone at the table felt the same way . . . . N for a burger . . . . really ? ! food was trying hard to be cool and creative and just wasn ' t very good at all with a very weak selection of items to choose to eat . wines by the glass were Noz pours , but priced as a Noz pour . i know because i use those mini carafes they serve . my friend ' s cocktail was watered down . server was attentive , but under trained in serving " fine dining " , or at least fine dining prices . . . didn ' t know how to pick up glasses or even pour water correctly . party of N was given N slices of bread and had to keep asking for more like there was a bread shortage . apple explosion dessert was a joke . . . looked like my N year old daughter made it and plated it . party of N walked out at N a person and very unsatisfied in all aspects
horrible horrible horrible . we had a reservation , they did not honor it . no apology , no explanation , no compensation for wasting our time . stay away
the place was a great find . near work , dive like atmosphere , but nicer and the bartender was great . unfortunately , our blonde bartender ( name unknown ) was replaced with marcus . a group of friends and i were there for sips , a wednesday summer philly special . we ordered beers , food etc . , and were having a great time watching the world cup when marcus comments to the group , right next to me , that " sips is a bullshit special , " and that the first time customers ( us ) , were keeping regulars from having bar spots , etc . etc . he didn ' t understand this was a chance for new customers to try out the place and see if they liked it . well , initially i did , initially we all did , but now we and our group of friends , co-workers and associates will never recommend , nor return . nice job marcus . 
chef mackenzie doing an awesome job revamping this fun tasteful and tasty menu . fun place , fun food , happy chef . . . . . gayborhood is alive an well ! 
great joint . great service , great food . quality people . a high quality option in queen village . 
has anyone else noticed the amount of offerings decreasing lately ? i ' d say i ' ve been about once a month for the past few months , and i haven ' t seen pork belly , pork loin , or beef tongue pastrami in a while . they didn ' t even have chicken out the last time i was there . huh ? 
ouch ! stopped-in for a lite dinner on a rainy saturday evening . their ' cubano ' sandwich boasted " barbecued pulled pork " on a homemade bread but i still have no idea what it is they brought to the table . the sandwich was grilled , charred panini bread and after taking a bite , something wasn ' t right . i opened the sandwich up to see boiled ham , sliced luncheon ham you would find at the deli at your local shop-rite . i hated to complain to the waitress but after realizing i just couldn ' t eat this gross mess , i asked her if i had ordered right . she told me that the bbq cubano sandwich comes with bbq pulled pork and ham ( who knew ) and that " there should be some bbq pork in there " . . . i opened the sandwich up to show her and she said " oh sorry , would you like me to bring you some pork on the side ? " " sure " i said . . she came back to the table a few minutes later with a bowl of what appeared to be boiled pulled pork . whatever it was or however it was made , this meat , smelling like old refrigerated pork had never seen a grill or bbq pit . service was friendly , prices were fair but the food left everything to be desired primarily the food we ordered . pass on this one . 
so disappointing . food is over priced and bland . brown lettuce in my salad . waitstaff acts like guests are an interruption to their day . seems like lots of underage drinking at night . . . or at least they look young . was there for drinks and birthday celebration a few weeks back . drinks were not tasty and the whole experience left me totally underwhelmed . with so many great choices in west hartford , skip this one . 
super good pizza ! 
the food is awesome ! i had the acacian honey chilean sea bass with portobello mushrooms and spinach , and the red velvet cake ! everything was spot on ! the quality of the food is great , the ambiance is nice ! my server christine was excellent ! i will definetely be dining here again ! 
special N . for two we waited N minutes on a saturday night . the cheese , the bacon just go and eat it . it was pretty spectacular--the story behind the store , quality of the ingredients , the fact that there ' s no tomato sauce and yet it still tastes spectacular . this was great . 
just a matter of time until this place closes . the newest owners have really run this place to the ground . hopefully once it closes a new owner that actually knows how to run a restaurant will take it over and make it a great sports bar once again . 
it really is good crust . very good . thin crust without being brittle and stale , and doughy without being chewy . but my pizza come out lukewarm , and the flavor just didn ' t wow me . good , but not amazing . 
best truck in manhattan ! there ' s no question about it and my point is proven everyday at noon time by the long waiting lines . i have been here a bunch of times always ordering either the chicken over rice " the works " or the chicken greek salad . . . both are just awesome . . . two thumbs up . . . never disappoint . the three biggest reason for N stars are N ) the portion - uncle gussy ' s is not stingy N ) the price - can ' t beat N lunch N ) chicken - juicy and tender
joe installed an outdoor tantenna on my house in brooklyn , ny . i found him helpful , professional , efficient , courteous and knowledgeable . not only that but he was on time . and he even called me the next day to make sure that everything was working properly . i will certainly call him again for other projects . i can ' t recommend him highly enough ! 
i ' m not sure what some other people experienced , but this is one of my favorite places in my neighborhood , the food is delicious , fresh and the ingredients are good . i know he uses mid to high quality ingredients because you can see it . i love all the panini , the meatballs and mac n cheese are awesome . . . my favorite thing is the beet salad with goat cheese . . . the wine selection is fairly impressive . two things they could improve are the bartenders and maybe expanding because it is annoying trying to get a table . 
the place is super cute . it was nice to just come here and relax with friends . the chef ' s dessert and tea was a good deal at N . you get your choice of drink and a ( rotating ) N-course dessert raspberry mousse cake , black sesame creme brulee , ice cream with berries , and a macaroon and truffle . i wouldn ' t recommend the cold matcha green tea ( N ) - it tastes pretty standard . go for something you ' ve never had before because they have an interesting and extensive selection of tea . 
it ' s soooo loud in there , so make sure that ' s something you ' re into . i ' m really not . the food was good though . the service was eh . it was also really hot in there . so - i won ' t be back , but - the friend i ate with loves this place . 
super fun tapas mexican place to come to . my visit was during happy hour on a weeknight . as soon as we walked in , there were hoards of people ( crowd consists mainly of mid-to-late twenty something year old working professionals ) waiting to grab a drink from the bar . their margaritas are particularly popular and tasty ! food was great . ordered the guacamole and chips to start , taquitos de carne , and pechuga de pollo . we were seated outdoors away from the loud bar and were able to hear each other just fine over dinner . would love to come back to try other items on the menu ! 
great place to come to . so excited it ' s close to home . food was really good , super friendly service and attentive . i think this place will grow fast . 
i love the size of the sandwiches here . they ' re small so i was able to order a variety and try a lot of different ones . i would say N per person is enough . like the menu says- " one isn ' t enough , two very few , three almost there , four getting close . . . . . but five are fantastic . " 
i like they cheese steaks and being a non english speaking native i would rather go to this place where i know the owners will be patient with my not perfect english which sometimes might come with non-english words . 
tonight i went on a date and i asked my date what kind of food she would like . unfortunately , she said what i ever i decide would be fine . i have heard about bogota latin bistro thru word of mouth . so i decided to go there even though i have never been there myself . at this time , i crossed my fingers and hoped that it ' s as good as i been told . let me tell you , the food was fabulous , and my waitress jean marie was fantastic . she was very polite and always smiled , which it was great to see cause the place was busy . i must really commend her cause to be honest i couldn ' t keep a smile on my face with such a high demand . the atmosphere was great and the music almost made me get out of my chair and dance . at the end of the night my date asked me how did you find this place ? i told her thru a friend and he swears it ' s not only great food but the service is amazing . jean marie made me feel very welcomed and for that , excellent job . i will be definitely will be returning and i will recommend this restaurant to all my friends and colleagues . 
thought this place was going to be am-ah-zing based on all the reviews . . and it just wasn ' t . the bartender was our server and even though the place was empty the service was super slow . we went for the cheese plate which was nice but they dont give you nearly enough bread jam , etc to go with the cheese and then they charge you for extra . culinary entrappment ! as for the cheese plate itself , it would be a great idea for them to stick in little flags letting you know which cheese is which ! so you actually know what you like and dont . we also tried the thai wings and . . well i ' ve had better . also , you would think it being slow there wouldn ' t be much confusion ? think again ! the bartender added a N burger to our bill without batting an eye . nor taking responsibility . all she said was " that ' s weird " . in addition she was so slow i had to go to the bar to get our check from her , N minutes after we requested it ! sorry food is average and service was horrible . too many restaurants to return to give them a second shot . simply not worth it . 
eh- more on the whatever side . felt rushed even though the restaurant was pretty empty . i think the staff could have been more attentive , and the food was somewhat cold . 
best brunch in the area ( buttermilk channel is better but that ' s a mile away in carroll gardens ) . really nice comfortable room . food is solid . the uovos affogato ( eggs in spicy tomato sauce ) are delicious . the tuna fennel salad has been happily devoured by friends , as has the bread pudding . perhaps strong place could learn from this bread pudding ? wish they served regular coffee instead of only espresso . 
great ! had it delivered from our hotel . it came really fast and tasted great ! pretty thin crust but it wasn ' t burnt like many pizzas that are thin . 
i ' ll be back and i ' ll update this review but for now , i ' m sorry nice views don ' t get you more than N stars . an off shoot to one of my favorite places to dine in la , a friend and i headed to the gorbals on a saturday night . i had called ahead on the thursday to ask about food since well that ' s what i wanted and was told " hopefully , yes " . see here ' s the thing , i ' m getting really tired of soft openings . you know the ones where a place has half of what it should and no one seems to know any details on when they will be fully functioning . or in this case as the bartender on the yes beautiful roof desk put it " i have the beers you see in the fridge ( which no i couldn ' t see as i wasn ' t in front of it and half weren ' t label out ) , a red , a white , a rose , and just order like you would at a dive bar , i ' m not making something fancy . " which wasn ' t a we have limited drinks , it was more a i can ' t be bothered because we ' re only open to take advantage of the fact you want to be on the roof while the weather is nice , but really we could care less about you just pick something . like i said i ' ll be back for food , when if they have it . every person we asked said something different for when that could happen . but until then , i ' d rather go someplace where i ' m not treated like an inconvenience while they are trying to get their act together , just because the roof view and seating was wonderful . 
quite possibly one of the best sandwich shops in the world . a bit pricey , but worth every penny . 
a serbian band ( accordians , guitars ) plays every tuesday and friday . it ' s as awesome as it sounds . beers are only N . 
this place is an emblem of my adolescence . now , many years later ( and much more mature ) , i am still transported back to those days but enjoy their delicious falafel , wrapped in a warm pita bread with lettuce , hummus , tahini and hot sauce just as much . 
really good , fun burgers . taco burger was fantastic . the meat is very flavorful by itself , and mixed with seasonings , it was great . buns for this burger were a hard taco filled with cheese , wrapped with a soft taco , and maybe fried ? then filled with tomato salsa , guac , and lettuce . burgers come with a heap of seriously good waffle fries . we also got onion rings , which were super thick cut and very simple and good . service is chill and can be slow . it ' s a relaxed hipster place , so not surprising . prices aren ' t awful , but not very good . i can get a better quality beef burger at burgermonger for half the price . the draw-in for this place is the fun and new burgers each month , but be prepared to spend N for a burger . also first check-in gets you a free lager . can ' t beat that ! 
so disappointed by the portions . i hate to give low-scoring reviews , but my experience left me pretty sad . let ' s just say i had heard rave reviews about this place , i was on the brink of hangry , and was trying to impress my little cousin by taking her out to a real montclair dinner . we all left somewhat hungry , and with sense that we couldn ' t say that we were still hungry because it was too expensive to logically still be hungry . when first walking in , the place has a mexican south american ranch feel to it-- think telenovelas . it has gorgeous industrial decor , with beautiful lighting . it seemed promising that we would get our fill of delicious flavors . now , don ' t get me wrong-- the flavors were delicious , which is why i can ' t rate it anything lower than N stars . but , for N people , a thimble ' s worth of N guacamole is absurd . ok , i ' m exaggerating , but it was so little , we each had a bite or N and it was over . i totally get the whole idea of " gourmet " portions , but that seems a pertinent piece of information that should be advertised about this place . and now on to what i did like the carne asada was amazing i wish i could just pack it into a giant burrito and die happy . the fish taco was very good due to the quality of cabbage i ' m big on how cabbage is cut because it effects the release of flavors of the cabbage and i have to hand it to villalobos , they know how to cut cabbage . i put their salsa verde on everything i wanted to take it home so i could pair it with other foods . ( i was also somewhat unsure who our server was , because it seemed many people were taking care of us . this is usually a good sign , but when we ordered extra salsa verde ( guilty as charged ) it seemed they did not communicate to one another about it , as a second staff member approached us regarding more salsa verde as he was taking our Nst empty away . but , this could happen anywhere . also , shouldn ' t Nst waiter haven taken Nst salsa ? . . . ) to end our meal , we ordered some churros con chocolate . the churros were N large churros , cut in half , to make N churros . they were really very thick , the cinnamon and sugar was ( as always ) good . the dipping chocolate had a good taste but there were ( somewhat salty ) chunks in it ( which doesn ' t fare well for dipping ) that put me off . the bill came and our stomachs and minds both agreed that this was not worth it . my friend mentioned that a brunch lunch experience here is better due to the portions and the service being more concentrated . i ' ll have to go again ( for that salsa verde ) and see if i can agree . 
my husband i knew that blue point grill would be good . every time we passed by we ' ve seen the lines , the crowds , and that its packed all the time . we enjoyed this place tremendously . we ordered the creamed spinach , coho salmon , wild , which came with mashed sweet potatoes . we finished off with a chocolate lava cake . the spinach was out of this world . i am surprised also ! who knew spinach could have such glory . i don ' t know what they put in there , probably butter , but it was amazing , and we both couldn ' t get enough . the mashed sweet potatoes were fabulous , cinnamon-y , soft , and really complemented the salmon to a t . the salmon was incredible , not too fishy , really well prepared . the waiter suggested it as the most complex in flavor . the lava cake was rich , warm and served with whipped cream , vanilla ice cream and a strawberry on top . the whole dinner was amazing . it is pricey , but well-worth it for a higher quality of ingredients meal . 
if you love meat i guess this is meat heaven . i ordered the fish , shrimp and scallops . it was awful , the fish was soggy , scallops , soooo salty , no taste at all . the only thing only thing on my plate that was okay , were the two shrimp . oh , and the potatoe chips . . . . . . . . when i ordered my meal , the waiter said , " good choice " . . . . . so , if you like good fish do not order any from here , stick to the meat . would not go back . 
very overpriced . sandwich was just bread . if each slice of bread is going to be an inch thick , it would behoove you to add at least that much filling . had a " warmed " ( read toasted - not what i wanted ) pastrami and swiss with mustard . all i could taste was bread and mustard . i am a bread lover but this bread did nothing for me and i ordered a sandwich ( which involves some filling ) . i give this place no stars but the app won ' t let me . 
great byob restaurant in the city giorgio is such as nice guy thanks for the nice evening
prime N orange is great . from the food , the beer selection and the service . angela is a personal favorite . she goes out of her way to make every experience a great one . the mushroom burger is wonderful . 
bogota has a great brunch and a good happy hour . i have always been happy with the food . 
overall this was a pleasant surprise . not usually in this area , but having gone to ikea we stopped by for a bite to eat and some brews . beer selection was great , it was very cozy and inviting , and though they were busy the service was admirable . the food was solid , my girlfriend had a very tasty burger and the fries were hot and awesome . i had a bratwurst and sour kraut sammy that was great as well . definitely worth a repeat visit . one thing to note is that once it ' s packed it ' s very loud , it didn ' t bother me too much , but those looking for polite conversation should probably go somewhere else . 
the best chinese food i ' ve ever had . the owner is the coolest guy around and the service is absolutely great . i can guarantee that you will not be disappointed eating at tg ! 
love love love the food ! kale salad is outstanding . omelete is amazing . coffee is good , bloody mary is drinkable . service is not my favorite but not terrible . 
love the liter glasses and food . . . lovvveee sauerkraut however , i know as all bars you guys need to kick us out at two but do you guys really neeed to be soooo condescending . . . honestly all you guys have to say is heyyy guys we are closing please finish up your beers . . . . or hey guys we are closing up so can you guys please stand away from the closing doors . . . . love the food but hate the service . its allllllll about the service . 
average food with horrible service . don ' t waste your time . 
was on my way to the post office when i spotted a small white sign that said spanish restaurant . stopped in to check it out and was impressed . ordered some food to take home and enjoyed my dinner that night . chinese food restaurant , your going down and milagros restaurant , your in it to win it ! 
visting from out of town and decided to try a few places near my hotel . carmines is where i went the first night . it has pretty good italian food and the portions are pretty large since it is all family style . we had the chicken parm and it was very nice . service was quick and friendly . the atmosphere was just ok but it was was easy for my first night . 
kid friendly bar and grill . the " shrimp scallops casino " at N west restaurant was nicely done , even without the glass of wine ! the service was exceptional . we ordered a quesadilla without onions for my finicky N year old son . when they brought it out with onions the waitress , did not make any excuses , she just apologized and had another one at the table in less than N minutes . 
the special appetizer of N different roasted veggies was a hit . the pastas can be ordered half portion as an appetizer . the chicken liver rigatoni was extraordinary , no really extraordinary . the bread basket was one of the best since rosemary on duane st . in nyc . we ordered the much reviewed lombardo and the margharita pizzas as appetizer . the pizzas were good , just not special considering food and wine reviewed as one of the best . so much for f w ' s pizza reviewer . our waiter , steve , described everything in great detail . wine . baked halibut was delicious as were the roasted artichokes ala carte side . the cappucino was artfully done and the beignets were tasted and left on the table . expensive and sort of worth it based on quality and preparation . just hard to pay new york prices based on philadelphia rents . we will return . 
dumplings were okay . not bad . the dough was kind of think for dumplings . usually the thiner ones are better . service is terrible . took N minutes for my dumplings to be ready even though there were only N people in front of me on line . tables should have been cleaned . over-hyped restaurant
best pho in the city . start with the beef stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer . they are great , i sometimes get the N because it ' s noodles and grape leaves , very tasty . when i ' m not getting pho i typically get the N with shrimp and i ' m quite happy . it has the perfect lemon grass flavor without being overpowering . the pho is to die for . i always get the N i believe . flank , brisket , and round eye . the broth is flavorful , the noodles plentiful , and a great amount of meat . nothing stands out because it all blends harmoniously . i love this place . they also take credit cards and i ' ve tried other things and been very happy . if you want just pho , go to pho ha , but stay away from everything else . if you want a variety , viet huong is the way to go . nam phong is solely for when parents visit , you have vegetarians , or you desperately need to people watch . everything else is lackluster comparatively , except their summer rolls perhaps and there is still a debate on that point . 
we dine here frequently . the restaurant uses fresh , local ingredients in french-inspired recipes that change with the seasons . the ambiance and service are superb . we particularly enjoy eating on the deck in the non-winter months . ( it is also the perfect place to sit during the quechee balloon festival--father ' s day weekend . ) the service is always first-rate . adam , mentioned in other reviews , is always gracious and welcoming . his wife , alex , is the chef who designs the delectable menu . during the winter , i love the osso buco , but my husband always gets the salmon , which is terrific as well . we both adore the olive tapenade that they serve with the bread . the only drawback to the parker house is the cost . it is not easy on the wallet . however , the price is in keeping with the food quality and service , particularly in this tourist area . 
clinton street is a fab little restaurant where you can get delicious brunch foods . the wait is rather long , so i advise you to go early or at an off time of the day or week . i will definitely get the pancakes next time , a speciality of clinton ' s , just wasn ' t feeling it on this particular day . . . huevos rancheros with chorizo - a flour torilla topped with their yummy tomato jam , pinto beans , chedder and jack cheese , two sunny side eggs , and then topped off with cilantro sour cream and guacamole . i would def get it with the chorizo , adds another layer to the flavor of this hearty brunch dish . cherry pie with crumb topping - freshly baked cherry crumb pie to finish off a fantastic brunch ! i would definitely go with the crumb topping version vs . the regular lattice style top crust . comes heated with a bit of whipped cream on the side . 
amazing food at a great price . treat yourself to their rustic tomato soup and then go for pan seared tuna salad . its gets a little busy there but def worth the wait
this is our " local " sushi bar , and we live in the yardville nj area . about a N minute drive without traffic , but still the only place we like to go . the family and staff that run edo is wonderful and always attentive and helpful . portions and prices are reasonable , and the chef is always open to be creative if given the chance - and it ' s not too busy . nice selection of american traditional chinese food as well , and the specials board always looks interesting . i think it ' s byob too . only complaint , i wish they had some booths and not just tables chairs . 
we have eaten here a few times and ordered delivery . the food is pretty good , especially for the area . i ' ve had better lebanese , but this part of queens is kind of a black hole as far as food options go . last time we ordered delivery , they didn ' t give us the hot sauce we had asked for with our shawarma wrap or pita chips for the fatoush . additionally , there was a piece of paper towel in my fatoush . not a small piece either , a whole sheet , enough to dry adult sized hands with . ( if you have to order in , i wouldn ' t recommend wafa ' s . they don ' t seem to put their orders together very well . 
i ' m a sucker for homemade pasta and this place really hits the spot . it ' s slowly becoming my favorite place to satisfy my pasta cravings . the portion sizes are perfect just like what they have in europe . you won ' t get a plate of pasta that can feed a family for N days . i ' ve tried practically the whole pasta menu and none of them disappointed . my picks would be the squid ink , tagliatelle , cappelletti , spaghetti alla vongole . the prosciutto and mortadella meatballs are really good too ! all the times i ' ve been here the service has been really good and food is consistent too which is a huge plus in my book ! 
am i just a spoiled californian or my taste bud for food just hasn ' t been the same ? it just can ' t beat shin-shen-gu- mi in hb , cali . with that said , i will give them kudo points for having exotic dishes such as neck , soft bone , hard bone , any bone . . great service though ! a bit small ( just like any nyc restaurant ) so you can hear your neighbor ' s convo better than your own . i prob might come back . . . however for the price and the quality of the taste , wasn ' t so impressed . oh how i miss cali restaurant ! ! ! ! ( 
when we walked in , the decor was extremely impressive . it had a fantastical mixed with retro vibe . unfortunately , the walk to the table was the better part of our experience . the menu is creole classic food . touff e , gumbo , po ' boys , chicken and waffles , etc . they also had fries alligator on the appetizer list , which we had to give a shot ! in a blind tasting , if someone put a mcdonald ' s chicken nugget and an alligator nugget in front of you . you couldn ' t tell much of a difference . this was because the alligator was so finely minced that all you could taste was the fried breading . the dish was N ! ! ! this was a huge disappointment . the restaurant clearly sells into the abita company , a new orleans based beer company . they have many of the beers on tap and in the bottle , a couple of apps are made with the beers . it was clear that it was meant to be a main part of the experience , however our server never once pointed it out , or even eluded to it . he pointed out the drink menu . the service was lacking . we had N trips to the table by him . once for drink orders , once for food , once for the bill . never a food check in , and service staff kept our waters full . for the main course we had po ' boys and touff e . everything needed major salt and hot sauce . to be honest , it was the most bland creole food i have ever had . nothing innovative , nothing special , just seemed like the chef got the recipes off recipes . com and called it a day . not to mention the food took N min to come out ! a standard ticket time is N-N min in a high volume restaurant . this is a hole in the wall ! this is a place that looks very cool and inviting , but is ultimately disappointing and really not worth the money . it ' s not high end prices , but it ' s N- N bucks for a sandwich . . . . just sayin . 
i ' m really surprised at the great reviews of this place . the food wasn ' t bad , but it was very bland . there was no cilantro in the guacamole , and the ' spicy ' tomato sauce on my entree was anything but . the sangria was pretty good , but overall the meal was disappointing . 
been here a few times for lunch and it seems to be the preferred spot among locals to eat . i love the fact that they have options when it comes to french fries ! regular , curly , sweet , old bay ? all of the above , please . draft beer seems a bit pricey , even on special , when compared to other local joints over in newtown . but , i have a feeling that the continental is the only joint with a liquor license in yardley so , i suppose they have pricing power . 
do not eat at junior ' s . times square , new york ! i had the worst experience ever ! i order french toast breakfast and the food was burnt . not some of the food but all the food . my friends food was fine , but the eggs were wrong . when her plate was being taking back to the kichen the store manager , white guy with arm in some kind of bandage like it is broken . someone properly whipped his ass . because this man a complete ass hole ! came to my table and said what happened with the food . i told him my food was burnt and i don ' t want anything else . he got mad at me and started arguing with me about it . but he never even saw the plate of food i received . then he took my friends plate of food which she just asked for different eggs and told her there was nothing wrong with her food . he told me that he does not know what kind of games and why i ' m playing them , i told him i don ' t play games and asked him for his name because he has the worst customer service i have ever seen . he refused to give me his name i asked N employees for the information and he run behind me saying don ' t tell her shit . don ' t tell her nothing . all of the employess were afraid i told him i was leaving and will report this to his corporate office and because of his customer service i will never eat at this restaurant again . he told me and friend to get out of the restaurant and he was calling the police . this guy is crazy . i called the customer service line and have not heard anything back . it ' s been a week . 
service , food and bar just right . the area has few like this . the guys and girls here definately make you feel at home . i have trouble leaving this place . if you want to watch a game they are always happy to put your team on one of the many screens . it ' s become my second lounge room ! the steak frites and chicken franciese are my fav ' s on the menu . great finger food as well if you want to soak up the drinks in a booth . 
we were so lucky to find this little gem ! ! ! this is a great spot for a delicious and healthy breakfast ! the juice was soooooo delicious ! their entire menu is organic and whole without sacrificing flavor ! ! ! to make our experience even better , the service was excellent ! ! ! brian and melanie helped us . they were speedy , kind and funny ! we will be back for breakfast ! the dinner menu looks yummie too ! 
great beer , great service , great food ! try the pasta carbonara . . . really excellent ! 
gross , boring , flavorless . if it was yummy i wouldn ' t have mind spending N for a small plate of ( watery ) steamed chicken and vegetables . will not go back . 
my friends and i had a wonderful dinner at cafe himalaya . the food was delicious . being a vegetarian , i was happy to see lots of choices on the menu for me . the restaurant itself is tiny , but the table was comfortable for us . the food portions were pretty large and i had a dish of mixed vegetables with pan-fried noodles . i also ordered a paratha bread on the side . i couldn ' t finish it all . the aura of the restaurant is clean and happy , with most tables filled with people in their Ns and Ns , i ' m somewhat older , but my friends are in their Ns . if you are vegetarian and don ' t mind a restaurant which is very small and filled with chatty diners , then cafe himalaya is for you ! 
with over N , N reviews the word about the spotted pig has certainly spread . the reviews have people trekking down or across town to check it out . the come here , they eat the burger , leave , then write their review . many are not absolutely impressed . who wants to wait over an hour sometimes two , pay N for a burger and eat it jammed in the corner on a baby stool ? . . . . . . . . . well i do . yelp brought me to the spotted pig for the first time a couple years ago , i got a burger and those were my thoughts about it after . i posted a N star review and moved on with my life . now being back over a dozen times i must say that one visit and one burger for that matter is not nearly enough to from a solid opinion on this establishment . i have concluded that april bloomfield is a genius and the spotted pig is my favorite restaurant downtown period . her food it outstanding , i ' ve eaten many things from the menu and many that have come up as specials . michelin ratings are broken down by food , service and comfort . ( i think ) the comfort covers d cor and the literal meaning of comfort . the spotted pig d cor consists of ceramic pigs . the tables are super small close together and lined with paper the seating is almost all stools . the servers are on their game , they are often tattooed , pierced and without sleeves . no ties here folks . so this leaves one to deduce that her food carried her to the michelin rating . if you have been once , go again , if you haven ' t been yet go and order more than a burger . get there at N and be seated at N N get there at N N and be seated at N N get there at N and be seated at N . every inch of this place is usable space so find a nook and grab a drink . . . . there ' s plenty of beers and cocktails to choose from . starting dinner a bit drunk is always the best way to dine . 
best brunch i ' ve had in a very long time . . . the bluebird is back ! ! we had brunch at the bluebird yesterday , and it was excellent . the food was amazing--we had crispy corned beef hash , and the farmhouse poached eggs with house cured ham and hash browns . there were four of us , and everyone was thrilled with their food . we also had a great bottle of wine , french-pressed coffee , and a yummy fried egg and grilled red hen toast for our son . everything was excellent--including the service ( which i often find completely lacking in this town ) and the ambiance , and even the music ( good not too , too loud ) . oh , and the prices were excellent . all entrees were less than N . i can ' t wait to go back for brunch and dinner too . 
my sister ' s favorite thing to eat when in ny ! we share chicken rice with lots of white and hot sauce ! we generally leave out the pita ( it kinda gets soggy gross ) , and bond while shoveling the deliciousness into our faces while belgian tourists look with mixed expressions of impressiveness and horror . 
i came to the city wanting to be wowed by food . balthazar succeeded ! ! ! a little loud but great atmosphere , attentive servers and support staff , amazing food ! 
are here for the first time yesterday and was sooooo pleased ! ! ! delicious food , great service , and delicious food ! ! ! we ordered the pancakes which are the best pancakes i ' ve ever had , the eggs benedict which were perfect and one of their specials for the day . each dish was mouth watering and i ' m already dreaming of having their pancakes again . 
naaa not for me
came here on a daily basis once it opened . my first chai tea latte that was made to perfection . however upon returning it lost the flavor that i use to dream of . it was definitely one of my favorite coffee shop when it first opened
great place to have dinner . the atmosphere and the food was great . i spent valentine with my wife and we had a blast . thanks to our waiter zack he made our evening very relaxing . 
good place ! ! small so make reservations . we ended up eating at bar because even with a reservation it was a long wait . yum tapas good drinks and if your lucky some entertainment . 
mmm , mmm , mm ! do you love pizza ? ! i totally do ! want a recommendation ? ! go to joe ' s ! you ' re gonna love it ! joe ' s pizza is so mouth-watering ! and the pizza can probably give your taste buds a new bff . trust me , because i must have been there about a million , hundred , and eight times . and now you ' ll totally see why the food is so fantastical ! the first reason you should , no matter what , try joe ' s is because of the amazing fluffy , ooey , gooey cheese ! one bite of that warm gooey cheese you will most likely die just to get more ! another amazingly , perfect , mouth-watering reason to get a slice of joe ' s is ( of course ) because of the delicious , nutritious basil sprinkled all over the delicious , ooey , gooey cheese . its like heaven just to chomp on that mouth-watering basil ! the tasty , perfect , delicious , marvelous last reason i ' m recommending joe ' s is because of their tasty , rich , sweet , creamy , fruity italian ice . plus its right in the fruit ' s perfect shell ! for instance , say you get a zesty lemon italian ice . it wouldn ' t be in a boring old bowl . it would be in a lemon shell ! how cool is that ? ! after all the explaining , i hope you can see why their pizza and italian ice is so good . i hope your next visit to pizza will be joe ' s ! ( because it will blow your noodle ! ) 
we love this place ! they have the world ' s Nnd best caprihianas . i say Nnd , because the one ' s i make at home are Nst because i use agave instead of sugar . with that said , the staff is friendly , there is always parking and the salad bar and meats are good in you ' re in the mood . if you happen to be there on a night when the dancers are there , you ' ll really enjoy . go and have fun . 
the crepes are great , made with delicious ingredients and fresh fruit . i usually opt for strawberry and nutella . i also really enjoy the coffee drinks , i usually go for a latte . the service tends to be annoying . there ' s a slow inefficiency to the dine-in service that leaves you feeling less than taken care of . also , as many people have pointed out , the styrofoam plates are off-putting . i usually bring them home for weekend brunch and give them the china they deserve . 
enjoyed the pork schnitzel . the nitty gritty corn cake was good , not great . asked for a green vegetable since it seemed to be missing from the menu , and the waitress suggested a side of sauteed kale -- it was ok , but not really seasoned . nice to sit outside . my friend enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich and pretzel appetizer . 
what an amazing place ! ! ! now i know what real authentic italian food tastes like ! the cheesecake was like " cake " ! wow ! ! and the lasagna " sicily style " ! ! was totally amazing ! ! . . seating is a bit tight it ' s loud inside yet ironically i felt very comfortable the staff treat you like family ! , very clean bathroom too lol ! , beatles music ? . . love it ! 
i would give this place ten stars if i could ! ! ! the food is always amazing ! ! ! everything i have tried is delicious and authentic ! ! ! the roasted chicken , beef stew , roasted pork , fried pork , picadillo , rice and beans , plantains , and rice and beans are always fresh and awesome ! today i went a little bit after lunch time and they were making fresh empanadas , total heaven ! ! ! ! the owner is always so nice and happy to have my business and thanks me many times when i am there . he is working on a simple website so he can post daily specials and such ! try this amazing little restaurant , you will not be sorry ! ) 
the oysters were very fresh even though they were kinda smaller than i expected . i tried lemon grass mussels and it was really good . also tried lobster mac and cheese , fish and chips . both were ok but over priced . overall , it was pretty good . 
the falafels here are superb . . . also i love their babagnoush . i try to come here every so often but its too bad that i ' m not in the forest hills area as much as i would like . the atmosphere is very family friendly . 
i didn ' t know that sake bar gagi was featured on anthony bourdain ' s " no reservations " and one of his favorite place to eat in ny until the day after i ate here . . . this little izakaya spot in times square can very easily be missed as you need to go down a set of stairs next to another japanese restaurant . luckily for us when we got there around Npm there was seating at the bar . . . it filled up pretty fast after us and they turn over the tables as soon as they can . . . the food and drinks here are worth waiting for . the service is pretty fast , though i did see some people wait a while for their food . . . but if you order enough small dishes , they come in time as you finish one plate to move on to the next plate . 
probably one of my all time favorite spots in the neighborhood . the menu changes every couple months so there is something new usually every time you go . they have a nice sidewalk cafe which is great when the weather is good , but the inside is very cozy and very nice in the winter time . other the fact that the food is great , one thing i really appreciate about this place is the fact that the service is really good , which is rare for restaurants like this . typically when you go to places like this , there is a bit of pretentiousness that is to be expected , but five leaves does not have that , so you get everything good food , decent price , and good service without the attitude . always a good experience . 
best filet mignon i ' ve had in a long time , served on flat egg pasta with sauteed mushrooms . crispy chicken made me rethinking what i ' ve always thought of poultry , this was incredibly seasoned with skin seared crisp to perfection . superb sauce . place is tiny expect to wait . service pleasant but didn ' t feel genuine . best for dinner of N , max N . 
pricing , quantity , and taste ! very very delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! had to get extra white sauce but love love this place ! ! ! ! ! ! ! chicken , rice and white sauce ! dont sleep on it ! 
chicken pad see ew , bang bang ! service is quick and efficient , the waiters are fly , and how about dat chandelier doh ? 
just moved to the area and my wife and i went to yummy ' s with a few friends . our reservation was N N and we were sat as soon as we got there . food was great from the white tuna appetizer to the sushi rolls to the delicious dessert . we had great service . everyone in our party loves sushi and raved about yummy ' s . highly recommended and will be back again soon . also we got a lot of food for not a lot of money and also a byob . 
my favorite brunch place in nyc . they have the best bloody marys , and their prices for brunch are quite reasonable . their brunch menu includes a coffee , oj , or a mimosa . but make sure you go early because the wait can be anywhere from N-N min for brunch . you can always wait at the bar and have a bloody mary though . i eat their eggs benedict every time . i ' ve also had the breakfast sausage , which is made from scratch by them , and that is also delicious . the best part is , it is only a N min walk from my place ! 
great food , small cramped place , but beautiful interior design . for a small place , they were still able to manage to divide dining into three areas a private group dining room near the entrance , a sushi bar along the corridor and finally the main dining area at the end with small tables ( this is where we ate and the tables were small and too close to the other customers ) . despite the tightness of the space , the seating is still reasonable . also , it is compensated by the gorgeousness of the interior design ( except for the mediocre bathroom - but i can forgive that ) . it highlights the best of japanese minimalism but with a touch of new york ' s urban sleekness and coolness . as for the food , delicious . i ordered the berksheir ( sorry , couldn ' t remember the right spelling ) katsu , some kind of breaded pork . thick ( a bit too thick for me ) cuts of meat . also , i thought i ordered the pricier bigger version but still found the serving small . cooked well , tasted great . their side sauce for the meat was delicious , even comes with a mortar and pestel to grind the sesame seeds to combine with their sauce . the entree also comes with miso soup and salad . the salad equally has a very tasty dressing , made fresh . tip the salad is refillable ( well-shredded fresh lettuce ) . overall , gorgeous interior design ( urban minimalism ) , great food despite the place being small . i would come back . 
man , what a dope idea for a restaurant . first off it seriously is a garage with the pull down garage door and everything . came here for brunch recently and was highly pleased . the vibe here is comfortable , i felt like i could have spent the entire afternoon here drinking . get the potato croquettes . no . get N seriously , those things were amazing . i ended up having the pork belly blt which i almost swallowed whole . i gave N stars because i felt like there could maybe be a bit more options but none the less the food and the drinks are good ( note , no brunch special ) . lastly , the wait staff here are a diamond in the rough . from the moment we got in we were treated like we all went to high school together . these people have great personalities . seeing that it was playoff basketball season , they had the game up on their projector and was even able to start up basketball talk with some of the crew , plus other patrons . i definitely see myself coming back for brunch and maybe even a chill drinking night since they close at Nam . 
quaint and simple , not trying to be something it ' s not ( like so many ny establishments . . . ) super fresh seafood ( they sell seafood here and in grand central station ) - everything i ' ve tried here is absolutely delicious ( mmmm , tempura oysters ) . this place is one of saving graces to the neighborhood i live in , which is laden with tons of terrible restaurants . thank you wild edibles ! 
menu is rather simple but tasty . there are tacos and quesadillas with either corn or flour shells . i preferred the corn . no seats at the stand so either find one in the public area or be prepared to eat standing . this is a great value meal for nyc , just realize the rating is for the food and not the complete dining experience as this is not a restaurant . 
a bit embarrassed to admit that this is my Nnd time in two weeks but these sliders are quite to die for . a tad overpriced but still worth the buck if you don ' t go quite often . extremely friendly staff the first time i went . we sat by the bar and the cook and bartender played good music as we all jammed out to it . great atmosphere for a laid back friday night . oh and the cheese is crack . 
good food ! good service not to pricy will vist again ! 
one word . . . mice . will never return , doesn ' t matter how good the hummus was . 
you cannot beat this place . just such variety and all of it is wonderful . if you are ever on jury duty , just skip on over and have some wonderful food . 
this place is so good . after walking around for N minutes trying to find a menu that looked appetizing to a vegetarian , ii bambino was a god send . the cheeses were delicious and unexpected . my date and i left with a N bill , worth every penny ! 
came in sight unseen for brunch with a friend and had a really lovely experience . the staff was welcoming and friendly ( and efficient ) and the food was delicious . it was a really nice meal and we left vowing to return . only regret was that the lighting was a bit bright - i felt like we were in a showcase . still , i ' ll bring my shades and return soon ! 
perception and honesty matter a lot . it is deceiving to include an automatic N gratuity on a check for two people with out telling them . furthermore it is disgusting to discover that i left you an additional N for good service after just glancing and not noticing your trickery on my check . you can have my N but you will not have my business ever again ! i hope it was worth it . while you are lauging at being able to sucker me , i will be laughing when you change your name and put under new management signs up . also , get rid of the fried cheescake - its not good . the filet is not bad but the dry , burnt onions on top are not good . the sushi is not bad . 
said i was craving burritos so my boyfriend brought me here and i was very pleased . i did get a burrito , and my only complaint was that there were mushrooms in it , other than that it was perfect . it isn ' t their fault that i didn ' t know about this so i ' m not even mad . i started off with fresh squeezed watermelon juice since the waiter offered it and i thought that sounded awesome , and it was ! for appetizers we got the guacamole and the cheese pot . the guacamole was fresh and exactly what guacamole should be . the cheese pot wasn ' t what i was expected but was really yummy . it was just really good melted cheese in a bowl , but it was just great quality and so simple . boyfriend got the steak burrito and loved it , i got the vegetarian , and my only complaint were he mushrooms , i just don ' t like them it general . otherwise a wonderful night out ! 
we absolutely love theirs sicilian pizza ! we order takeout from this place a few times a month . they also sell pizza by the slice ! 
this place constantly brings in the best craft beer across the country , and the service is always top notch . i see so many establishments get wrongly trashed on these social media outlets and its unfair . i think people need to be more understanding and allow for an explanation or an attempt by management to reconcile different situations . the food , service , and drinks are incredible ! keep up the great work ! 
food was disgusting . the waitstaff was useless . lots of staff but zero speed . very tacky . disinterested servers , long waits for drinks . got the check for another table entirely . order was screwed up . very disappointing all round
the pizza is decent , and i like that it ' s one of the few places open late here in the am fm , but they need to get their act together sometimes . it ' s usually just minor details that get missed , but sometimes waiting nearly N minutes for some onion rings just takes all the fun out of eating somewhere , y ' know ? 
solid . ruby ' s is a niche burger , so it ' s hard ( and maybe not fair ) to compare it to other burger experiences . although they serve a really good burger , it ' s not really a " burger place " ( much nicer , i ' d argue ) . burger - i got the bells burger ( plain beef patty without the chili , mayo , egg , etc . accouterments ) . the patty had more seasoning than most , and so i skipped the usual condiments ( just as well . . . they weren ' t brought to the table and so i ' m not even sure they have them ) . the bun is actually a ciabatta roll , and it works perfectly to soak up all the juiciness from the patty ( there is a lot ! ) if you order it medium , it ' ll be perfect . sides - it comes with a salad . it ' s not wrong , just surprising . no fries anywhere to be seen . also , they set a small dish of olives on your table for snacking on . the burger was hefty enough that no one in our party was left hungry , even though we didn ' t order any sides . drinks - but they have smoothies ( didn ' t try them ) , and australian beers ( not foster ' s ! ) , and wine . and coffee . they serve breakfast here but i haven ' t tried it . during the Npm - Npm happy hour , they serve N pbrs . other menu items - ruby ' s is a good place to suggest if you would really really like a burger , but are with a group of people who are looking for something else . they ' re stealthy that way . the menu also includes a number of panini , salad , and pasta options . i looked at them suspiciously as though they were red herrings , but then i saw them coming out of the kitchen and , hey , they actually looked pretty good ! my friend was captivated by the aroma of a bolognese that arrived at the table next to us ( fortunately our own burgers weren ' t far behind ) . finally , the service . ruby ' s is indeed a tiny establishment , and so we had just one waitress taking care of everyone . she was very attentive and authentically nice . even though the place filled up by the time we were finishing , she never rushed us to leave ( though we did the right thing and didn ' t hog our table once we were finished ) . if you are coming with a group of people on a friday ( like us ) , i suggest you arrive not much past Npm , as people will keep trickling in until every table is full . i kind of want to go back already ( day after ) . that ' s how i know it ' s definitely a N . 
chestnut was closed , and this place was consistently rated high for its brunch on foursquare and yelp . i figured it was a good sign . we went for brunch , sunday at noon as N people , we were seated very quickly . i got the pancakes and biscuit . the pancakes were unimpressive , although i did like the addition of the jam . but , there jam butter pancake ratio is insanely low . i felt like i was eating dry pancakes ( because i was ) . the mrs got the char no N eggs . she was unimpressed as well . we both liked the biscuit . the additional bacon gravy was a good combination as well . although it ' s not a requirement , iv grown accustomed to having a mimosa included in the price . there is no such policy here unfortunately . but , it was a less than N brunch ( tip included ) so i was happy . i don ' t get the high brush weddings , it seems like more of a dinner feel . 
great dishes ! 
one of my favorite vietnamese restaurant . i like their vietnamese sandwich and bahn mi . great taste . . . 
this is good pizza . grandma pies are the best . peperoni and hot peppers , really really good . this is pizza that you have to eat right when it comes out , i have gotten delivery a few times and it is not nearly as good . the service is so so . something i find totally bizarre is that every time i come here for lunch they have this weird techno tiesto type music playing its so strange to hear that at like Npm . other then that i have no complaints . 
i work in the area . i was looking for lunch the other day , tired of the bodega sandwich . luckily , i ran into a friend on spring street on his way to ba ' al . i joined him . incredible falafel sandwich . the falafel was incredible . best i have ever tasted . first , the pita is substantial and rich with flavor . it does not split into soggy pieces in your hands . second , the falafel ( best in the city ) is so light and airy , seasoned expertly . third , the herbs are so fresh and vibrant , balanced with the spice of cumin and coriander . fourth , the sauces are perfect accompaniments . finally , damn it ' s gone . i went back to the office and bragged about it . maybe , i ' ll tell them where to go tomorrow . maybe . 
this place serves fresh seafood for a very reasonable price . - the red white and blue special for the oysters are great . really fresh ! -i also got the scallop ceviche and my oh my it was good ! i finished the whole thing ! the scallops were very sweet and fresh . -the lobster was also really good . the king crab legs were just okay . . . - i mainly came here for the maryland crabs and steamers but they were sold out of steamers ! the crabs weren ' t in season . . . what a disappointment . i will be coming back here for it next time though . 
i feel ashamed for the fact i have not left a review for belgiovine ' s before . i was sitting here on this snowy day thinking of what to grab for lunch and since i ' ll be in montclair , belgiovines is the perfect place to go . all of their sandwiches are great . they have good quality italian meats and cheeses . all of the in-house stuff too ! there is nothing wrong i can except that it ' s in montclair and not across the street from my house . this weekend i had a chicken cutlet , with fresh mozz , prosciutto , and broccoli rabe . go try a signature sandwich or get creative . go hungry because you will leave with more than you planned on getting . enjoy ! ! 
meh , meh , meh , and more meh ! for some reason , i ' ve avoided this cart for N years . now i know that on a subconscious level i must have anticipated how underwhelming the experience would be . i had curry cod fish , chickpeas , spinach and cheese over jasmine rice . at first i couldn ' t decided if the food was good or not ( a bad sign , i know ) . the right seasonings for a successful indian dish were present but the food tasted stale ( possibly from sitting out too long ? ) . choking on several fish bones definitely tipped the scale . 
been going to this sub shop for about N years since high school . always the best subs around , and even if they don ' t use all thumans meats their stuff is still very good quality . how many places can you get a N inch sub for under N a special that they run after N every day . 
this place is amazing ! excellent service . last saturday i took a friend out of town here . it was my second visit and it was every bit as good as my first visit , all the curries are particularly recommended . if you like thai food , this place should be first on your list
overall great food , casual atmosphere , nice selection of wine ( various price points also ) and very attentive staff . i always get the spaghetti carbonara and ciambelli w the carmel sauce . the ciambelli is reason enough to go here . 
wow . tacos were amazing . put extra in the tip jar . good stuff . don ' t pass it by . go to the black truck . can ' t wait to go back . 
best tandoori rotis i ever had in us , fresh from oven . . . . . friendly staff . . . gud option for people who gt bored with kebab paradise and shahi kebabs on the same street . . . . will def try other items on the menu next time . 
the N star reviews are true . top sushi here folks . i can live on their tuna avocado rolls . ymmy ! 
i have been a customer at domenic ' s for the last N years normally eating there once a week . additionally , i have had many parties there over the years as well . in the past the atmosphere has been warm and friendly , recently it seems that things have changed . in the past ( since i am at the restraurant frequently ) the staff would all come over and speak to me , now it appears that they were told not to do so unless they are your waiter waitress . interacting with the staff in addition to the quality food is the primarily reason i have enjoyed this restaurant over the years . although the food is a better quality than most chain restaurants , it seems that the atmosphere is trending toward an olive garden . 
bait and switch - i ' ve walked by ruth ' s chris many times and have eaten there , too . i saw a sign for happy hour offering an N steak sandwich . so , a few days ago , i tried it . it was delicious and the service was excellent . my health club is across the street , so i planned to return . however , when i got the check , the sandwich was N . i was told that the sandwich was N only at lunch , but that ' s not what the sign said . so , i ' d appreciate an explanation . by the way , the pomegranate martini was watered down . 
i followed all of the amazing reviews when i tried out this cute , local spot . we got there and there was a wait ( always a good sign ) , and we had a very helpful bartender pick us out a half bottle of wine . everything was great- the food- the ambiance , our super cute waiter . conveniently located in the food desert that is murray hill ( even though it ' s in gramercy ) . get the eggplant parm- you won ' t be dissapointed ! 
excellent menu selection , service , and margaritas made with montezuma tequila . i had the chili verde dinner which was delicious . wife had a carne asada fish which she thoroughly enjoyed . we will be back . 
i basically come to yuca bar for one thing and one thing only , their brunch . this place got me seriously hooked on huevos rancheros . that and a mimosa were my sunday meal almost every sunday for a year . super affordable too ! 
we tried this place for brunch recently and were pleasantly surprised . i wouldn ' t have expected such great food from a tiny pub sports bar . my husband enjoyed the house burger thoroughly . his only complaint was that there wasn ' t quite enough cherry pepper relish on it . i asked if i could order the breakfast burrito minus the tortilla and fried potatoes in order to avoid gluten and they were completely accommodating . not only were the burrito fillings delicious ( mmm , carmelized onions ) , but the kitchen provided a fresh , perfectly dressed salad on the side . we ' ll be back ! 
it ' crowded . be prepared to wait outside for a table and then squeeze to get to it . they might loose an odd order , or bring you something you didn ' t order at all . but it ' s worth it . atmosphere is cool and the food very good for a reasonable price . that is why most local and not so local hipsters come to this bar . habana would be even better , if their regulars wouldn ' t be trying so hard to look cool all the time . cuban sandwich and sloppy jose are always a good choice . 
took my family and hubby here for an authentic italian dinner after taking them shopping in soho . it was . . not what everyone was expecting . i ' m guessing it was a little too authentic for my parents . overall , the food wasn ' t bad , and the atmosphere was nice , but nobody was blown away by the food . except maybe my sister , because she ordered this yummy roasted chicken thing . 
the owner waiter is incredibly rude rude rude . he yelled at me and my significant other for putting our winter gloves on the table when we sat down . for the rest of the duration of our meal , he told us only limited items on the menu were available ( smirking and giggling ) he slammed down our drinks staining our cloths . nook was a place i would go to through the years but no more due to this guy ' s attitude . get over yourself sir , your restaurant is not le cirque as you put it ! as far as the food , mediocre at best . 
good food . good service . excellent sangria ! ! 
love love love this place ! i went with a friend here at around Npm on a saturday . when we entered it was pretty empty except for two people in the corner . we were greeted by a male waiter who told us we could choose to sit anywhere we wanted and recommended the back since it was available . in the back there were several comfy leather sofas with pillows and tables . we ordered the escargots , bacon wrapped scallops , duck rillette , and wine . since it was happy hour the wine was only N a glass . the food was delicious and quite inexpensive ! when we needed more bread the server gladly gave us another basket . the atmosphere is also very relaxing . i ' ll definitely be going back and bringing more friends . 
excellent food and friendly service . i go almost every week . they treat you like family . don ' t miss the mussels . they are to die for . 
i was lucky , only half an hour wait . got a seat at the bar , watching the chef making ramen noodle is the best part . not to mension the noodle is also awesome . i was happy to hear they open up new locations . 
poor quality , very expensive , small pie N . N , less mozz less sauce , cash , cash , cash it ' s crazy , no credit cards , so no receipts . vegetable paper plate N it ' s insane . . customers will pay for expansion of this pizzeria . we are fool to pay for their new property . no bricks oven as advertising , stinky waitress with smell of cigarettes terrible taste calamari . do not follow the name , old people gone already , new people are greedy . 
this was my first visit to vinted . i used to frequent uncorked , which occupied this space prior to vinted and always loved it there . i was a little worried that i wouldn ' t have as good an experience with it under the management of the federal . i was pleasantly surprised to find that the atmosphere was fun and light . the staff was knowledgeable about the food and the wine and were able to make good recommendations for parings . we started off with a meat and cheese plate . we had roquefort , bleu cheese , and prosciutto . it came with a honey comb , a few grapes , and raisin toast . we had a glass of zinfandel that went perfectly with it . for dinner we got the soft shell crab and the short ribs . the crab came in a bowl of spicy corn chowder . the crab was very good , but the corn chowder was the star of the dish . it was well balanced with good flavor and just a hint of spice from chili oil that lingered for just a minute after you ate it . the short rib came on a panzanella salad , which was fantastic . the rib , although tasty , was not as flavorful as i would have expected . the staff was fantastic and we struck up a conversation with the couple at the next table . our waitress , tracy , was friendly and joking around with us and the table next to us . the manager , gary , visited our table and found that i have a love of italian wines . he told us about large format bottles of great wine that the open on friday nights . it is so nice to have a place that i can get an affordable taste of a wine before i purchase a glass or a bottle . they had a beautiful amarone on the wine list that was nothing short of spectacular , but a glass or a bottle is outside my price range , but we were able to get a Noz taste of it ( and it was totally worth it ! ) . we skipped desert , as we were too full to eat any more , but the table next to us raved about the smores , and they looked delicious . we plan to put this on our regular list of restaurants we visit , and i plan on coming back on a friday night to try out some of the wines they get in the large format bottles . 
ok , i was late to the doma party -- i discovered it two months ago and have been four times in that period . the first time i was pleasantly surprised and wanted to go back . the second time i was wowed . the third and last time i was underwhelmed with one notable exception . so the best i can say is doma is inconsistent and here ' s why . . . the small plates apps on their menu seem to be thoughtful , creative and well-executed . the reason i would come here -- the fish -- is decent quality , but the reason i have to pause is that their sushi rice is way off base . on a good night , the rolls stay together , but the rice is still flavorless . on a bad night like my last time , they fall apart , or are borderline dry . sushi rice is supposed to be seasoned carefully with the right about of rice vinegar and alcohol . it is also literally fanned by the chef to give it a sheen and allow for perfect amount of stickiness . none of that was present in this rice . having said all of this , the service is friendly and the vibe is modern and pleasant . i ' ll go back but it will be a long while . and i suggest a reservation on weekends because unlike the sushi , the neighborhood is consistent with their patronage of this cute bo te . 
food the food here is pretty good and on the fancy side . i had their duck dish , which was one of their specials that day . it was flavorful , moist , and tender . my dad had a pork dish and my mom had a shelburne farms chicken dish . we all shared a bit of our dishes with each other and we enjoyed each other ' s dishes as well . the bread that they served before the meal was very fluffy and memorable . service the hostess greeted us promptly and brought us to a table quickly . the waitress was friendly and helped us promptly . i thought wait staff at the front of the restaurant was wonderful , but it did seem like quite a while before we got our food and my parents agreed . they might have been understaffed in the kitchen that day , not sure . there was also only two tables being served at the time we entered . cleanliness the placed is very clean . not sure of the restrooms since i didn ' t use them . atmosphere the place is very beautiful and cozy feeling . even though the place is only a restaurant , they place felt like a fancy bed breakfast and i liked it . great for a romantic meal or relaxing meal . the place is very nice for the area that it ' s in and not what you expect when walking in . other notes they had a visa and mastercard sign on their door . not sure , if they accept other credit cards or not . even though i thought the food was very good i did felt like it was a bit on the pricey side for what you ' re getting , but maybe that ' s just me . we each had a dishes , no appetizers except for the small plate of bread they served , a soda , coffee , and orange juice for a total of N with tip . there is also an upstairs dining area , but i didn ' t check it out and we ate downstairs . 
came here for a nice dinner with the girlfriend . the wine was really good and the assortment of bread was none like i ' ve seen . there was sourdough , white , wheat , and even sandwich type things with prosciutto in them . the assortment of food we ordered was interesting . we each decided to go with one of the chefs specialty dishes . they were both pretty good . i ordered a baby goat type dish which was good but the taste was so new that i was taken back at first . i know there is another scarpetta in the fountainbleu in miami ( owned by the same person ) so if you have the opportunity i would definitely try one of these out
had dinner here last month on the advice of an employee of mine and it was a great pick . friday night can be busy here - people usually have dinner here before a broadway show due to it ' s location . if you time it right , you can get a table pretty quickly as the dinner crowd leaves to go see their show . we arrived while things were still pretty busy , so we had drinks at the bar . within N minutes , our hostess had us seated - very nice ! i started with the endive watercress salad with roquefort and walnut dressing . it was great , and the chunks of roquefort were huge ( i had to break them into smaller pieces ) . for my main entree i ordered the grilled new york strip steak with red wine reduction and french fries . i ordered the steak medium-rare and it came out perfect . the red wine reduction comes in a small bowl on the plate for dipping your steak in . i can ' t tell you how good this was - very good flavor and the steak was cooked to perfection . for desert , i tried a taste of another employee ' s hot fudge pudding cake with hot fudge sauce on top of it . it was very good , but also very rich extremely sweet . if you order this for dessert , i suggest splitting it between two people and make sure you have some ice water handy ! espresso here is also good - available in single or double shots . the service here was outstanding . when we arrived , we were seated at the bar until our table was ready , and once it became available , they moved our drinks over to the table without asking us to cash out our bar tab . can ' t say that i see that happen very often at other establishments . the hostess and serving staff here did a great job . i would visit joe allen again on a future visit in the city . if you are a world-traveler , you might be interested to know that they are also located in paris , london and florida now . enjoy ! 
my son and i dined here last night . it was simply incredible -- great and friendly service and the best sushi i ' ve ever had . had trick or treat roll , special veg roll , and cal rolls . all were just amazing -- fresh , creative , and best ingredients . we ' ll be back ! 
in and out in N minutes ! ordered , picked up an italian hoagie , peach iced tea and was out the door . great service ! if this was wawa i ' d still be waiting in line . 
when we couldn ' t get a reservation at N madison park at a reasonable time , my husband and i decided to check out ai fiori for his birthday dinner . the food was phenomenal and a great value at N for a four-course prix fixe . the service was good . the space is ok - not particularly warm or exciting , but modern , neutral and clean . the restaurant is located in the setai hotel , and it being a hotel restaurant , there is only so much they can do about the crowd . the place has its share of annoying tourists and business people . but once the food is served , you forget all about the rest - it transports you to a better place , all your own . 
i can ' t really compare this to the other pio pio ' s but the space is really nice . great place to take a date . food is pretty solid , big portions , tasty . no complaints here . i will have to try the other locations . 
after picking up my preordered cronuts from dominque ansel bakery a few blocks away i decided to come to jane since i was starving . i saw a bunch of people outside waiting but that didn ' t stop me from going in to ask how long the wait was for N . luckily the bar end had one seat left as if it was waiting for my arrival ! so excited that i got seated right away on a sunday at prime brunch time . i was craving meat so i ordered the benedict johnny but that vanilla french toast looked and sounded so good . i must try that next time . i couldn ' t drink alcohol so i ordered the fresh squeezed oj . it was great that the drink was complimentary but the oj was a bit on the sour side so i had to take a swig of water right after i sipped the oj . the benedict johnny came and i enjoyed the chicken sausage , tomato hollandaise sauce on the semi pan fried english muffin with a side of home fries which were crispy . my server which was also the bartender was awesome . her name was caitlin and she was pretty funny too . definitely come here even if you ' re a party of N for food . they also have a small downstairs section which i discovered as i went to the restroom . the section would be great for a private party . make reservations ! 
the spaghetti was delish . the waiter was a bit annoying though because we ( three diff people over the course of our meal ) asked for more bread and he would not give us any and we ordered a feast ( including drinks apps dinner desserts and coffees ) . 
top N thai restaurant in hell ' s kitchen area . the food was yummy ! ! ! decoration is very nice and unique . the biggest type of drink that stands out at the bar area is the cocktail . bar can change color by itself that is so cool . i had hello kitty for drink it was awesome with strawberry taste ! ! ! for food i had kow mun kai tod that was amazing i never had before . it came with N different sauces one sweet chili and another one was spicy . it was so good . my friend had chicken patthai . he loved the decorated dish . if you have a chance don ' t forget to stop by here , you will love this restaurant . 
soba-ya would have gotten a solid N stars from me for their food , but , i ' m sorry , i have reasonable expectations of customer service , and soba-ya failed to meet them . i came in with three others , and two of us happened to still have a coffee drink in our hands , and the hostess told us we couldn ' t bring them in . oh , i ' m sorry , i wasn ' t aware that they served coffee . . . . wait , they don ' t . so i asked why , and she responded , " . . . because we sell drinks here and we want you to buy our drinks . . . " mindblown okay , i get that restaurants totally have the right to establish their own no-outside food and drink policies . i ' ll even give the hostess some credit for her honesty . but really ? it was a late morning for us . we were tired . we had out of town guests - so we got them coffee from one of the best cafes in manhattan ( this was no N coffee , alritey ? ) - and we came here to eat . i didn ' t need someone telling me that we couldn ' t have the rest of our coffee at their establishment , because - that ' s right - they wanted more of our money . ultimately , it made us uncomfortable , and that discomfort is what ' s going to stick with me for awhile , and not their oyakodon . pity ! 
once again another spot on and fantastic experience at pine . having the hanover burger last night , i couldn ' t resist letting you all know that it was out of this world ! ! a really big and scrumptious burger . a spicy mayo adds that " wow " . again , the service was fantastic . 
this review encompasses N dining experiences , the first one during the first week of the official opening and the second one this past weekend . it was very interesting to see the differences in the service and the menu in just a short couple of months . the reason for N stars would be the service that we experienced in our most recent visit . all staff were incredibly attentive , aimed to please , and in short , knew their . service alone was N stars . the food was all good and solid . it appears that they have edited their menu quite a bit-- in this most recent visit , we started with a grilled cheese appetizer with butternut-apple soup and the smoked sturgeon carbonara . the grilled cheese was made differently this time , though no one at the table could quite put their finger on it . the soup served with the grilled cheese was previously tomato soup . . . . switch back to the tomato soup ! the butternut-squash apple soup was barely touched by our table ( which never happens ) . the carbonara was rich , buttery , all things that carbonara should be-- but barely any sturgeon ! for entrees , one friend said it was a delicious burger , and i have to say , those fries were crunchy and extremely salty ( good thing i love salt ) . i had the dry aged steak which was served with a buttery potato gratin . i specified medium but it came medium-rare still delicious though ! another friend had the arctic char , which she enjoyed but wished there was a sufficient side , as it came with N small fingerling potatoes . the desserts ! on the night that we came , they apparently debuted N new desserts , the warm chocolate cake and the other , i cannot remember . no matter , we tried everything . the warm chocolate cake , though i desperately wanted to love it , was very underwhelming and sadly the letdown of the desserts . the hazelnut financier cake with vanilla semifreddo and pomegranate consomme was amazing ! the beignets with vanilla custard and cranberry compote blew my mind away , and the apple crisp was perfect . the blood orange sorbet was a highlight of the ice cream and sorbets that we tried ( i did not like the beer ice cream , but that may just be personal preference ) . please bring back the molten chocolate tart ! i loved it last time ! all in all , it is a gorgeous setting and the service is wonderful . i definitely want to try more of the bar menu-- seems to be very solid , as many were ordering from it around us . be sure to get the dessert ! 
g cafe bakery now has a new haven location ! nice selection of sandwiches and all types of baked goods right here in town ! 
i absolutely love this place . it never fails . ever . quality . consistency . great food . lovely ambiance . friendly , knowledgeable servers . reasonable prices . not crazy crazy busy that you have to wait N hours . good espresso , also ! i ' ve been going here for years . i do breakfast ( scone the best in all of nyc , the frittata sandwich the best way to start your day ! ! ) , grab baked items ( always delicious ) , come for dinner , sometimes a snack ( oysters , anyone ? ) , and what i like the most is that you can come for only dessert , get it to go during their dinner service and sit outside on their tables and eat it . no pressure . of course the dessert is their chocolate salted caramel pie thing . the best dessert ever . i love this place . have i mentioned that i love that dessert ? maybe more than my boyfriend . hmm , i won ' t tell him that . but i ' d be hard pressed to choose . keep doing what you ' re doing , marlow sons ! 
we went as a group of N for dinner , after a couple of the group had enjoyed a lunch here . even they were surprised at the extensive wait , and the portion price ratio . others have noted the ' patio ' . the furniture looked like it was purchased from a condemned high school . traveling past the bar to the dining area was difficult to manage . the servings were small , and expensive . i don ' t mean that they could have been a little larger several of us literally walked around the corner to the subway shop , on park , due to lingering hunger . i guess cannibals must be pretty thin . the pig ' s head looked nice , but was too pricey . the food we received was long in coming , and nothing special . the bartenders were nice . wait staff . . . as they say above , " meh " . 
pizza is awesome , get anything with the mike ' s hot honey on it , including the ice cream sundae . also buy a bottle to take home ! it ' s everything i want in a pizza and more . i wish i lived closer . 
i came here based on what i overheard in town , the place looked pretty rundown . but i think that ' s what gives it the charm it has . you can tell this place is a boonton secret . i came in and had some random nice man pay for my meal . this place honestly revived my faith in this town ! i was feeling so down in the dumps - had my car keyed- thought i was going to fork over N to fix it - then i came here and it was a breath of fresh air . the waitress was so friendly , the food was fabulous , the patrons are so welcoming . it ' s an experience . a great experience . thank you ! 
the line here used to get pretty long at night , and sometimes it still is . it is worth it at this location , as the artichoke slice is delicious . you are getting a lot of pizza for you money . the artichoke slice is huge . they have an indoor place where you can sit now if you order a whole pie . 
better second mortgage out when by a couple of dinners from this place . overpriced average food . . thats it . 
great pizza , much better than just a run-of-the-mill philly pizza place . but what is the staff ' s deal ? ! ? ! i ' ve never seen a more unhappy-looking group of people at a work establishment , and the counter girls are some of the meanest , downright unpleasant people i ' ve experienced . nowadays i will only order delivery so as to avoid all these curmudgeons
if you are reading my review in hopes of finding a place to eat by yourself or maybe with one or two people , i would say N stars . the food was pretty good . i always walk away full and satisfied whenever i eat at a chowder pot . the best part about this place was our waitress and her how she handled a large party of N out to celebrate a birthday . i feel awful because i cannot remember her name , but she was super attentive and made the whole experience amazing ! we brought a cake and strawberries , which they were more than happy to cut up and serve to us after dinner ( following the singing of happy birthday with us too of course ) . she kept our glasses full and she was even kind enough to wrap all of our leftovers . there were a lot since we were in the partying mood and all ordered way too much food ! if you are looking for family or party dinner spot , i would recommend this place ! it is tough to find good places with a little bit of everything to make everyone happy ! 
came here for brunch , which is offered everyday . food was amazing , price was right and service was great ! 
i enjoyed this place more than i thought i would . i usually am very picky when it comes to international dishes , but everything was divine . i ordered the salmon and it just melted in my mouth . everyone at my table kept trying to steal another bite of my entree ! the decor is lovely , you can ' t stop looking at the high ceiling , and chandeliers . they have a very lovely chefs table set in the back of the restaurant that is sectioned off from everyone else . i asked the waiter about it and he was very knowledgable and had to qualm with stopping to give me the details . my group saw right near the fireplace , which created a lovely setting for our dinner . next time , i want to try the chefs table . if you ' re debating on going , don ' t , you ' ll love everything . 
what can i say ? i recommend the place constantly . must trys include the " sangrita " - a frozen margarita with sangria poured over ! , plaintain encrusted chicken , empanadas , coconut shrimp , garlic rotisserie chicken . . . i ' ve been there in groups of N to groups of N . call ahead ! so happy that they are now open for lunch ! 
minca is legitimately one of my favorite meals in the east village . clearly an excellent hangover food , this delicious bowl of ramen is sitting in the most delicious broth that your taste buds can imagine . do yourself a favor and don ' t even pickup a menu - just order the following N . spicy miso ramen - pork and chicken broth N . N it ' s delicious . in fact , i ' m going to head there and get one right now ! 
another fine pizza meal . came with our two older sons for dinner . we arrived around Npm saturday nite , quickly seated and served by our fine waitress . ordered the usual bomb and pepperoni sausage - N large pizzas . our service was attentive , prompt , with repeat pitchers of water without asking . the pizza cooked to perfection , with a few slices left for take home . this is dependable , constant , good quality pie . 
the best sicilian slice ever ! ! it was soft , and the sauce was just right . the regular slice is decent compared to the sicilian . just prepared to hunt for a seat or stand up because it gets really packed ! ! ! 
the worst management i ' ve ever come across ! i walked in to get a grilled veggie hot wrap with herbed mayo ( for the Nnd time because it was good the Nst time i ordered ) . i asked the manager who was attending the cash register for a knife , who gave it to me as if i had bothered her for it . i got home and realized there was chicken in it . really ? chicken in a grilled veggie wrap ( apparently they just heard the order as with chicken ) . i took it back and they gave me another wrap , this time i opened it in the parking lot to make sure it was right . of course it wasn ' t , there were only grilled veggies with no herbed mayo ( it ' s advertised on the board with herbed mayo . i told them to cancel my order as i had been fed up by that time . so i asked for a minibagel with honey walnut cream cheese . i ' m expecting a refund for the rest . she says " you can ' t get a refund . i threw in a second minibagel with honey walnut cream cheese . " so she charged me N for each mini bagel and i wouldn ' t even have gotten the second minibagel , i would have gotten something else . she just threw it in there . she said " you have to understand i have to throw both the wraps out . " well i say " you have to understand , tell your workers to make it right . " the worst managment ever . 
friend of the chef suggested i try this place out , from being greeted at the door to having one of the best waiters ever , pig prince was top notch . the waiter made great recommendations from apps to wine selection . really liked the decor , atmosphere and of course the food . will absolutely go back again . 
such great pizza , not a huge variety but soo delicious and fresh ! feels right at home as soon as you walk in . 
this place - yes . vegan tacos - yes . it was one of those situations where upon recieving my meal of N tacos , i thought i ' d do the " lady thing " and eat half , save the rest for lunch the next day . however , it was so good , i could not resist - ate everything right then and there . fresh and flavorful and the salsa served on the side is actually spicy ( coming from a spiceaholic ) . best tacos i have found since the west coast . vegetarian options that are actually thoughtful and complete . lots of adventurous options for my carnivorous friends too . most of my table ordered the kangaroo burger and loved their food as well . everything was delicious ! and to top it all off tasty cocktails ! i went with a large party so the service wasn ' t as fast as i would have liked , but nonetheless still worth N stars . great eats ! 
nice place . i went there last night and the female bartender was very unfriendly and seemed to be frustrated with her job . made me feel un welcomed
funky place with a great fish taco and awesome guacamole
i hade the pork belly buns , i enjoyed them very much ! 
sud is a great find worth looking for . the food is authentic italian with homemade pasta and homemade sauces . i ' ve been there twice and had the ragu lasagna both times because it is so delicious . tried the other dishes from friends i was with and enjoyed all of them . the atmosphere is soft and relaxing . the tiramisu , my favorite dessert , is wonderful . is there ever such a thing as " too rich ? " 
great place ! feel in love w brazilian bbq , found this place on restaurant . com , so decided to try it ! the experience started w the free parking . yes , its free but u tip the guys there . . . but i didnt like that i wasnt allowed to park my own car . im very picky about handing over keys to my car ! once inside , the place was very nice . decore was modern and clean . our server was very nice and fast w our drinks . we ordered the all u can eat which came w the salad bar . the salad bar was big , lots of different things from cold salads , mozz tomatoes , fruit , hot items . . . the only issue i had was the meat started to come out almost as soon as we sat down w our salad plates . the meat was delicious ! and for the price . . . who can pass up all u can eat ! we finished off w cappacino and good dessert of a big cart w many choices ! the dessert and coffee were good ! the bonus . . . we got a great price because of restaurant . com i cant wait to go back ! 
the quick overview -- N bottomless mimosas bloody marys at weekend brunch -- discount if you check in on yelp -- i would go back -- i would recommend to a friend sunday brunch is always a treat . . . sleep in a little bit , but still wake up soon enough grab a bite of breakfast food with friends to enjoy the last day of the weekend . that ' s exactly what i did at box N recently . a girlfriend mentioned that there was a place in new haven that had bottomless mimosas bloody marys for just N , and served breakfast food to boot . she didn ' t have to ask me twice if i was interested in going ! a group of us met up to rehash the week , try out some new food , and -- for some -- take some hair off the dog that bit them the night before by getting some drinks . one bloody mary might be hair off the dog , but taking too much advantage of the " bottomless " part of the offer could quickly turn that hair into another dog itself . but i digress . . . everything on the menu looks enticing . i probably looked at it about N times trying to decide what i wanted . i finally settled on southern bell -- i figured the eggs , spicy andouille sausage , and cheese grits would hit the spot for what i wanted that particular sunday morning . and hit the spot it did , with me cleaning my plate ! friends got biscuits and gravy , jumbo belgian waffles , and chicken and waffles . nobody was disappointed , and most people agreed that they would order the dish they had gotten if they returned at some point . so , the verdict ' s in , and box N makes the cut as a yummy brunch spot in new haven . but don ' t just take my word for it ! 
we went to blvd bistro for father ' s day . we are a family of five ( with one child included ) . we went during the beginning of dinner hour ( N N ) . they gave us a choice of sitting outside ( beautiful weather ! ) or sitting inside and we choose inside . short version , the meal was amazing ! i had the pan fried chicken with collared greens and potato salad . the chicken was fried to perfection , yummm ! ! my husband had the short ribs ( equally yumm ! ) my son had the turkey meatloaf , which he loved ! my daughter had the humongous sized pork chops , which she also raved about and my youngest had the mac ' n cheese kid-size . my daughter also took home the apple pie which she described as scrumptious ! drinks were red sangria ( very good ) and sparkling sweet tea , which was a really good flavor ! the chef never stopped by and the biscuits ( to me ) were a little overcooked , but still tasted great ! all-in-all we were very satisfied customers and will go back again during brunch because i want to try their shrimp grits ! 
nice little find in old city . we came here based on yelp reviews looking for a cocktail lounge for drinks before our late dinner reservation elsewhere . yelp did not steer us wrong . it ' s a small cozy joint . good ambience , has an old school international vibe to it . check out the coffered ceiling . we were able to score a N place high top across from the bar at N on a saturday . there are some booths in the back . the place filled up as we were there . the drink menu is interesting and different . wifey was very happy with the french snap . i had a classic margarita and a dark and stormy . both were tasty and easy drinking , but i feel like they were a little light on the liquor . maybe it ' s just me . drinks were about N each . it ' s not cheep , but pretty much expected prices for a downtown bar . another nice thing is it wasn ' t loud . i don ' t remember if there was background music at all . there was lots of bar noise from the other patrons but it was pleasant and not overwhelming like other places where you have to shout to hear the people you are with . wifey and i were able to have a nice conversation . one thing we were confused about is if you were supposed to go up to the bar if sitting at the table . we entered , sat down , waited a bit . we were discussing if i should just go up to the bar when the bartender came over to get our order . then the place got busy and we didn ' t get any attention until a second bartender came on and checked on us . when we were ready to leave we has to flag down the bartender for the check . maybe i ' m getting too used to table service . i dunno . 
one of the best meals we ever had . small but cozy and chic . original not trendy atmosphere . although the food is not inexpensive , it was fantastic ! so many layers of flavors in all of the dishes from the complimentary zucchini blossom through the dinner to the delightful dirt trio . yum ! great place for date night , can ' t wait to go back . purchased the cookbook and the owner personalized the book for us . bloomfield could be moving up with places like the orange squirrel on board . 
don ' t go to any rizzuto ' s in ct you have a N-star experience . avoid the snobs in the restaurants . order to go . their pasta , while pricey , is made from scratch you can taste the authenticity . the pizza is slightly inferior to pepe ' s , but not by much . as with pepe ' s , be expected to wait . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
recently moved from cali , i live in brooklyn but work at the west village , on my breaks i like to search for places to eat and i ' m so glad i found this place ! it ' s definitely a great place to go to ! ! my waitress was great , didn ' t get her name , she didn ' t need a check book to write my complicated order ( i was afraid she was going to get it wrong ) when i got my food it was perfect ! very delicious ! they have a variety of things and their drinks are a bit expensive but strong ! definitely recommend this place ! ! 
it is my second time to visit k town and i think bcd tofu house is worth trying . the service was cool . best korean restaurant in nyc . this place can get really busy during lunch and dinner hours , so try to come a little early ! i love the side dishes . there are lots of vegetables . 
lovely little french bistro hidden in murray hills . we felt like we were truly in france paris . the staff paid excellent attention to us and the dover sole was to die for ! ! ! ! ! ! great wine selection . very small restaurant but just as cozy as it can be . i recommend ! ! 
impressive unlimited drinks on weekends ( literally barrels of fruity concoctions ) , however . . . the food was mediocre at best . for brunch had omelettes , must admit i ' ve had better at diners in queens . expected higher quality food considering the prices and location - near central park . dinner menu was better and the cheese breads are amazing . ( once again proves that can ' t judge a book or restaurant by it ' s fancy cover ) . 
this place has one of the best vietnamese food around . definitely try the bo luc lac ( beef cubes ) with the fried eggs and soup
wow ! easy to find- cheap parking- amazing food ! ! ! ! ! wonderful service- fancy but not too fancy- burgers are incredible ! the bison meat ( it was my first time trying it ) was very tasty . julie was very attentive- manager came by and made sure everything was good- highly recommended-
i ' ve had many many xlb throughout my life , the best is still din tai fong dumpling house from taiwan . joe ' s weren ' t bad , but the skin on the dumplings were still too thick . it was deliciously juicy nonetheless , and the crab dumplings were even tastier . i recommend getting both the crab and the regular to compare ! we arrived before N on a saturday , only waited N min . it may look like alot of ppl but it moves very quickly . 
very convenient to the subway stop , good drink selection and d cor . i agree with the comments . a bit pricey food . . . . . . . but come in for the drinks and a bit to eat . a good hang out place
i love pizza , thin apparel , hare krishna , i love carol ! 
my husband and i tried barbacoa bbq N days ago because i bought a groupon certificate and boy were we pleasantly surprised . while it isn ' t " fancy " ( simple tables and bottled sodas ) the food was delicious . i didn ' t read the yelp reviews beforehand since i do not like going into places " influenced " by others that i do not know and therefore can ' t always trust what they are posting or why they are posting it and you should try this great little restaurant too and judge for yourself . the waitress was courteous and attentive , the food was done to perfection ( moist and piping hot and oh so smoky thanks to the oak fire pit ) and the portions are huge . we had the hot wings , ribs and a bbq chicken and while i didn ' t love the bbq sauce that was served on the side , the food was so moist it didn ' t need it anyway since it was juicy and flavorful . this is our new bbq spot ! nutley , nj
i used to love tuptim . sadly the service and food have gone down in quality quite a bit over the last couple years . my wife and i went a couple of months ago , and they brought out the food , but forgot our plates . we waited about N minutes , couldn ' t flag anyone down ( because no one was on the floor ) and finally i went over to the serving station to get our own plates . after going there more than N times in the last N years , this was the final straw . the food is good , although not the best i ' ve ever had , but the one thing that is absolutely fabulous is the coconut soup . 
stylish and beautifully decorated , but disappointing otherwise . food was acceptable , not memorable . we had dal mahkani , paneer tikha mahani , vegetable samosas , naan , and chicken tikha massala ( which was overcooked ) . the food was overpriced for the quality . hands-down , the worst part of our experience was the body odor of our server who smelled like he had not bathed for days . 
i did not have a good experience eating at this restaurant even though the food is tasty . the service was so slow that it ruined the dinner for me . our three course dinner from a fixed menu ( limited options ! ) was dragged out for N . N hours . sometimes this can be a wonderful thing when you and a romantic partner are lingering over wine and moonlight , but that was hardly the case on the particular wednesday night when i ate at zahav . my party of five consumed our food quickly once it arrived and then wondered , " where is that next course ? " note to zahav not everyone with a N N reservation expects to get their entr e at N Npm . if that ' s your mo , a little more bread and hummus would have been nice . 
my husband and i waited N minutes to receive our orders -- eggs-over-easy for me , bacon burger for him . this was around N in the afternoon , and the place was not busy . when the food finally arrived my eggs were scrambled not over-easy , and the waitress brought rye toast instead of the whole-wheat i ' d ordered . my husband ' s burger had no bacon . " i didn ' t hear you say bacon " the waitress argued . the fries were unbelievably greasy and had a weird texture , as if they ' d been dipped in breadcrumbs before being fried ( breaded fries ? what a concept ) . they made me queasy and i couldn ' t eat them . worst was the orange marmelade i spread on my toast -- i realized too late that there was a bad smell to it and it tasted revolting . how old could it have been ? and stored how ? when it came time to leave , the waitress could not be found to prepare our check . while waiting for someone else to do it i mentioned our unhappy experience to the manager , who just shrugged . i ' m actually not a picky person about food , and we were very , very hungry . but this was the worst diner experience i ' ve ever had ! ! 
my mouth is watering just thinking about this place . fried avocado taco ? don ' t mind if i do . and the vegetable taco is heaven . it can be super crowded and slow to deliver , but the food is just plain yummy . do it . 
always fast and awesome ! i have been ordering from here for years , they are the best hands down . friendly very fast great food . check them out you will not be disappointed . 
wonderful went for my birthday last week . blood orange margarita pitcher is good and better pricing than just ordering one - ) . . also got complimentary churros for my birthday . the waiter we had wasss soooo nice and super cute and explained everything clearly . i got the pasilla braised pork . . delcious . . no complaints ! ! 
over crowded with the nastiest , most unprofessional staff . there are too many nice restaurants in that area to be abused by people who do not appreciate their customers . i walked out because i was so turned off by the nasty , unprofessional staff and i would never go back . i walked down the block , across the street to a japanese restaurant and they were more than happy to serve us with a smile . it is a zagot rated establishment and the staff was great . ! ! 
N green eggs ham N . N N salmon benedict N . N N steak and eggs N . N N veggie burger w avocado N . N we shared between four people . nothing was really notable . 
this is my go to place for seafood in queens . it ' s a not a big restaurant and it ' s usually a wait for a table , but the most i ' ve had to wait was N mins and that was for a group of N people . everyone is very nice the hostess will keep you updated on how much longer it would be . while you wait , they serve you a glass of wine . nice touch . as soon as you sit down , they serve you hot bread with olive oil , delicious . appetizers i usually go with the large greek salads ( with a brick of feta cheese ) , fried calamari and stuffed grape leaves . as a main course , the stripe bass and sea bass are awesome and nicely portioned . stuffed shrimp with crabmeat is a winner . the lemon potatoes are awesome and dessert is on the house . i feel full just writing about this place , that ' s how much food they give you . 
well , maybe it was an off day , but my boyfriend and i ate here for brunch yesterday , after hearing a bunch of good reviews , and we were pretty disappointed . he had the huevos rancheros , with " supremely spicy chipotle sauce , " but the sauce never came . . . i had scallops and " grits , " which was actually polenta - undercooked , runny , bland polenta with a bunch of parsley thrown into it to try and give it flavor . . . the one good thing were the N ( yes , N ) scallops - they were cooked to perfection and super tasty . the chipotle sauce , they said , wasn ' t ready , they ' d bring it out right away . but his food was getting cold and he was hungry . . . so he ended up finishing it , the sauce never came . they apologized at the end and took off a couple dollars , but . . . it was lame . so i probably would only bother trying this again because of the nice garden in the back and the byob policy . 
good food , friendly staff . i love the marinated grilled chicken dinner , really has a great flavor . most of the dinners come with a salad and either potato or rice and a vegetable . they make the best broccoli around . . . don ' t know how they season it but it ' s really yummy . my husband loves the prime rib which i think is only available on friday or saturdays . solid eats ! decor could be nicer , but would definitely recommend the food . 
delicious ! we had the sinfonia de paste ( all you can eat pasta ) , hangar steak , and dessert sampler and all were delicious ! near our times square theatre district hotel , this chef lidia ' s restaurant was an excellent value for a delicious dinner when it comes to a wonderful italian nyc dinner . it reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in firenze ! cozy and lively with delicious authentic cuisine ! 
hungry ? cold ? what are you waiting for , head your way to ippudo for some warm noodles ! hirabata buns ( pork ) kasane-aji ramen ( special ) heaven though i wasn ' t thoroughly impressed with the tori tatsuta age , i think it ' s more the chicken that lacked the flavor not the flavoring itself . the special ramen was delicious , the mixture of chicken and pork base is just perfect . the ambiance is great as well - very lively with people shouting " onegai shimasu " every time someone from the front brings people in , etc . tables are shared with others--the decor is very friendly . the matcha creme brulee ice cream is to die for ! ! you ' ll lick your plate clean , fo ' sure . so save some room for dessert ! 
after waiting over an hour and shelling out over N for two people for a couple appetizers , two iced teas , and two sub-par ramen bowls ( tip not included ) , i can confidently say that this place is completely overrated by yelp users and it should not deserve a N to N star rating . pros friendly and good service , modern and fun environment , and delicious appetizers . we got the pork chicken buns and a deep-fried lotus and shrimp special appetizer , which was definitely the best part about our meal and i highly recommend . cons oolong iced teas were good , but not great and the amount served was only about N to N ounces ( after the ice ) , and refills are not free , which was something that our server failed to mention . i got the tori ramen and was disappointed not only in the very salty broth and little amount of food , but the lack of ingredients that came with the noodles and soup . my girlfriend got the wasabi shoyu ramen , which was not only very salty , but very sweet , and eating the tofu that was completely soaked in the broth was like eating candy . both of us love authentic noodle soups and it ' s rare that we leave even a single drop of broth , but in this case , half of our bowls were still full of the broth because we did not find it eatable drinkable . in conclusion , we left disappointed , unsatisfied , and feeling a bit ripped off . the ramens that we ordered were not only small in size and limited in ingredients , but they lacked a full and flavorful broth , which in my opinion is the best part about any noodle soup . i don ' t mind paying a lot for good food , but N for a bowl of crappy ramen is not what i expected on a saturday night out with the girlfriend , especially at a place tauted as one of the best ramens in new york city . 
this place , although much-lauded , was a complete and utter disappointment . we came here as a group of N , after making reservations well-ahead of time . when our group arrived , the manager had no record of our party calling , nor any seating available for us . we waited a half an hour before even being offered water . since we went to celebrate a friend ' s gallery opening , and this was his preference , we stayed . the service was terrible , and no apologies were made for forgetting our reservation . i ordered a beer which never arrived , and the fried clams i ordered came cold and burned . my friend ' s order of livermousse was more like a liver pate , and had the consistency and flavor of cheap cat food . however , the biggest disappointment was that the waitstaff were all very surly , and seemed visibly annoyed with our group , although we were all polite and courteous . i would not go here as a group , nor would i return here . 
finally , a pizza shop that has owners that actually interact with their customers . these guys appreciate you each and every time you walk in their shop , even when calling in for a delivery order . their chicken caesar salad pizza is addicting ! and everything else i ' ve tried on the menu is yet to disappoint . a great city feel with their outdoor seating and an amazing part of the family feeling with their vip service and inside decor . they truly want you there and can ' t wait to see you next time . 
love the atmosphere ! one of the coziest restaurants in the hood ! the burger and fries is always a great choice ! 
after seeing " gentleman ' s guide to love and murder " - which is great , by the way , my bff and i were going to go to cielo , based on other reviews . we got there around N N and were told they were closed . odd , because there ' s a big sign that says after theatre menu . . . oh well . the girls recommended lillie ' s . i ' ve been living in ny for almost N years , going to the theatre for that long , and never heard of or seen this place . we walked in and were blown away by the decor ! it ' s beautiful ! so warm and charming with beautiful artwork ! we were seated immediately in the back corner by the fireplace . our waitress was very nice - great service . only reason for N stars instead of N is the wings . i ' m a buffalo wing aficionado , and these wings were nothing even like buffalo wings . first of all , they were thickly battered ( wrong ) , and second of all , they had absolutely no flavor or heat . worst but no least , the meat part of the wings tasted old - stale - like bad chinese food chicken . there were only about N , and they cost N - way overpriced - just bad wings . but the burger was great - the fries were good , drinks were excellent ( pricey , but large ! ) . so overall , i would definitely recommend stopping here for drinks or a light meal . wish i would have tried something different as an appetizer , but so it goes . it ' s convenient - and yes , the bathrooms are gorgeous ! we will definitely be back ! 
came here for sunday breakfast , there was a Nminute wait for a table for two , it wasn ' t so bad . they called us right on time Nmins later . but when we got sat our server took pretty long take our order and he took another table that got seated after us , it was annoying because we were ready to place our order . finally after he took the other tables order he came to take ours , he was pretty friendly , he was obviously busy running around since it looked like he got seated with N tables around the same time and he was sweating . our food took a little longer then expected and my meal was a little warm , i could tell it was probably sitting there . so that def could ' ve been better , the lemonade was fresh . once the server gave us the check , it took about N minutes and another server asked if we wanted them to take our check and they came back with the change , so we didn ' t even see our server after he dropped the check . would def go back , but i expected more customer service . 
went here on a whim with a friend , and the food was delicious . dishes i can vouch for --chips and dip . the kitchen was actually out of waffle chips , so they baked the butter-onion dip onto a flat bread . amazing . --shrimp and grits . creamy but not watery , didn ' t skimp on the ( fresh and sweet ) shrimp . --pumpkin ice cream with gingersnap cookies ! mmm . i should also mention the staff was friendly and accommodating no attitude here . i plan to go back . 
disgusting ! food was tasteless and service bad . these people are frauds . euro is awful . 
i came here on my first trip to new york about two years ago and i haven ' t stopped thinking about the food ! it was amazing , and when i go back , i will be dining here again . 
this is my favorite restaurant in new york . the few times i have been have each been unique and delicious . incredible food . slightly weird atmos . turbot with truffles was something so exquisite i do not have the words . i would recommend chef ' s table to any foodie and hope to come here again for another special occasion . 
it was time . i had heard the rave reviews . my good friend , a self-proclaimed pizza expert , had proclaimed the hellboy as life-changing . so , on a thursday night , my date and i wandered into the rustic warehouse , ready for our lives to change . with the dim lighting , wood-burning oven , and good old-school jams playing in the background , it made for a great date spot . ( well , besides the fact that i went on to inhale an entire pizza ! ) we chose the hellboy-- spicy sweet perfection . you will not regret this moment . the perfect complement was the in ricotta da vita , topped with the fresh , flavorful ricotta , arugula and fennel sausage . my only regret was that i was too stuffed to try dessert-- and they sounded amazing . just another reason to get back on the g ( gee ) train . 
we ' ve visited this place on the recommendation of a friend and have been back a few times since . . . so i guess we are fans . here is what you get . there are N options for the buffet . all salad bar , all meat bar or a mix . personally , i like to get the mixed plate . the meats that we are aware of include - flank steak , sirlon , chicken ( i think it ' s usually dark meat ) , pork loin , chicken sausage , pork sausage , short rib , chicken heart , bacon wrapped turkey . i also feel like they have lamb , but i could be mistaken on that . i have to be honest that it is a bit of a hit or miss with everything for a number of reasons including , the time of day you go and the way the dish meat was seasoned . but overall , for the price you pay , it ' s good and consistent enough . if you are in the neighborhood , stop by and try a little of everything then go back from more . 
their fries are the best ! the food is always good simple , ample , and better than what you ' d expect from a diner . the waitstaff is without exception professional and prompt . if you want fancier " atmosphere " and higher prices , go elsewhere . . . . but for the money , the " elm " gives you more than you could ask ! 
i tried this place a couple of times once for dinner and once for breakfast . for dinner , the waiter pretty much ignored the table and after N minutes , we left . for breakfast , the food was average at best and seriously overpriced given the quality . again , the waiter wasn ' t that great . the only redeeming quality about this place is the host and supporting staff . you can do far better in nyc for this amount of money . 
momoun ' s will always have a special place in my heart . first ate there when i moved to ny back in the day and was going to nyu . only have a couple of ? no problem , mamoun ' s would always satisfy . flash forward to today and momoun ' s still does it for me . falafel ' s are as great and as cheap as ever , and the place looks exactly the same as it did N years ago , and probably exactly the same as it did in the Ns . the hot sauce is insanely good too . 
while it is outwardly unassuming ( only a small , green sign hangs outside the door that puns " keep calm and grow on " --a nod to their commitment to use fresh , locally-grown ingredients ) inside it has real presence . the atmosphere is refreshing a sleek design reminiscent of momofuku ( crack pie ! ) with lots of light and a surprisingly tasteful music selection . ( i heard both al green and smokey robinson ! ) the staff was helpful and charming , eager to answer any questions i had without sounding condescending or annoyed . there was a palpable sense of comradery among the workers , which translated into a more pleasant experience for me , as a customer . the food was tasty . i ordered the spicy garlic , which was , as the name suggests , spicy , but very dimensional--certainly not overpowering . paired very well with my orange-banana-lemon smoothie , which was clean and refreshing ! am likely to return on a regular basis . 
tiny drinks appetizers , huge combo entrees , loud like crazy . came here with a reservation for N people . seated right away , and the place was really hopping . took our drink orders , ordering a pitcher of their raved red and white sangria . each pitcher was only enough to fill N cups only to the half way point , which included the ice and fruit . i ' d say only about N ounces of sangria for the N cups . so tiny that even with the N pitchers , many people still did not have a drink . upon drinking the sangria , people who know sangria would not actually rave about this one . it contained so low of an alcohol content , that you tasted the melted icecube water more than anything . even macaroni grill ' s sangria taste better with more fruit , alcohol , less ice , and size of pitcher . the appetizers are not good for groups either . there are only N empanadas in the appetizer dish , N shrimp in that dish , and N calamari rings for that appetizer . needless to say we had to order multiple of everything just to have a taste . the entrees here are suppose to be known for their chicken , hence the namesake . yes , it is juicy , and the combos are huge enough for N normal diners . outside of the chicken , orders such as the baked salmon , and chilean seabass are orders to stay away from . those are over baked to kingdom come . so dry inside and out , most of the fish ' s omega-N fish oils are non-existent , and you would barely be able to taste the difference between the two fish . happens when food is mass produced and not made to order . the unisex bathrooms are tiny in the lower level . it is roughly the size of a bathroom on a plane . also , every sound made in or out of the bathrooms can be heard . it ' s like the walls and door are sound conductors . on top of that , there are sometimes lines to use the bathrooms , so people on line can hear your business . service by the waitstaff was cordial , but way overwhelmed . had to wave down the staff to get a baby chair , extra plates , water refills , etc . they were always patient and kind , but far too few of them for the amount of patrons . the ambience is definitely giving off the manhattan vibe . loud , lively , crowded , dim lighting , and full of dried wood lining the walls . the music and surrounding crowd noise level is to the point that one must shout to be heard by the person sitting across the table from you . the end bill turned out to be N per person , and some of us had to go elsewhere afterwards to grab something to eat . 
this place is a bit hard to review because it really only does two things spinach pie and baklava . it ' s a small stall hidden in the back corner of the essex street market , so it ' s the kind of place that you swing by if you ' re in the area and take your food to eat as you walk . to their credit , both their spinach pie and their baklava were very good and tasted home-made . the flaky pastry crust of both seemed very well done to this non-expert . given what kind of place this is , swing by and check this place out if you ' re walking by the building . if you like it , you ' ve found a new interesting place to visit to get good food . if you don ' t , you only spent a couple of bucks but now know what the hubbub is about . 
i ' ve been a foodie since before food got popular , and am now just starting to yelp . instead of just being a passive participant i ' ve decided to get active and log my nights out in order to remember when and where i went . - ) to keep things simple , i judge all restaurants on the following criterion food , drink , space scene , service , price . so here goes ! food - the cuisine of this venue is indian fusion . there is something for everyone , food can even be tailored to vegans and those who are allergic . we had the following - watermelon feta salad mint sorbet - chili pork dumplings grapefruit confit - ginger scallops - graffiti burger garlic fingerling potatoes chipotle mayo - braised pork buns apricot chutney - chickpea crusted skate mint yogurt sauce - duck portobello gratinee mustard onion confit everything was typical for the progressive chefs of today- delectable and well plated . this is not a place that overplates and turns the food into art . my only complaint was that the staff head chef said everything was tapas family style and the portions were a bit short for a party of four . drink - the drink menu only had N cocktail- the lychee martini which was verrry generous , not served in martini glasses , but rather in giant wide topped glasses which meant more liquor and less spill . the wine menu was brief and simple - not nearly as extensive as most foodie hangouts . this is liked as it made choosing less trivial . space scene - do not go here for special occasions . the restaurant is very tiny , like having dinner in your typical nyc shoebox apartment . it is smaller than barrio chino if you have ever been there . all N-N tables are on the right side while the waiters and guests have to squeeze through the left just to get to the tables . and once you get to your table you ' ll probably have to share a larger table . i knew this in advance and did not mind . i enjoy this type of experience from time to time . but i can ' t stand people who give good places bad reviews mainly because of the space situation . you showed up , saw the place , you didn ' t have to eat there ! finally , for those that crave trendy popular spots . . . the headchef competed against morimoto on iron chef , and also was a contestant of last years top chef . service - wasn ' t over-the-top and pretentious , which i like . but wasn ' t bad either . if the waiter who was waiting our table was busy , we just asked any other waiter for a dish and it came out in a timely manner . also , chef mehta is very likely to be waiting your table too ! price - there are N or N dollar tapas . the price is relatively reasonable as if the venue were larger , they could have charged N more for the same portions . dinner for ( N ) came out to N before tip . we had a bottle of the hanging vine - cab sauv , lychee martini , and the plates mentioned above . no dessert as we were adequately appetized and i wanted to take my parents to pinkberry for their first experience . all in all , i enjoyed the food . it was good , relatively unique , and flavorful . somewhat spicy ( not by asian standards ) and because the portions were smaller , left you wanting a little more . 
i ate at the orient this past weekend while visiting a college friend in vermont . the atmosphere is fine and the food was good , not great , not horrible , plainly good . however , i wasn ' t particularly fond of the service . we were with a group of N people and were polite . upon other requests made , such as another drink or more water , he seemed quite aggitated and was not very friendly or accomodating . it ' s interesting and i must note that i did not see a female worker in the entire establishment . i ' ll give it N stars for mediocre service . 
the place is a nice addition to the neighborhood , and the food is good and reasonably priced . it ' s too bad that the service is so poor , or i would visit this place more often . me and my dining companions as well as other people in the bar and restaurant were constantly trying to flag down wait staff on a recent night when the place was not that crowded . be prepared to wait and don ' t come expecting good ( or friendly ) service . if you are in the neighborhood , beau mode and good king tavern are much better alternatives . 
treat yourself . this place is very special . first time i went i spent quite some time browsing the market . just tasting the samples they have out is a treat . the olive oil they sell here for example is special . bright , snappy and fruity . sunshine in a bottle . try some . then cross over to the deli counter and try the sausages they have out to pick from . and try the hazel nut cream they have out as well , for dessert . now that i am a regular i understand how deep the charms of this place go . it ' s more than an excellent specialty mart , more than a kind of small , spanish version of eataly . the small lunch counter they have in the back is in itself a destination restaurant . try the flautas , really you can ' t go wrong . the pairings of cheeses , hams and artisan bread are perfectly pitched . the sandwiches are small enough that you can order say three between two persons to share . and you do want to share because each offering is so special . the staff all speak spanish and english , and are very kind . when my credit card didn ' t go through ( the magnetic strip was worn down ) they joked merrily with me in a very charming way . the place is decorated very smartly , nice butcher-style white tile on the walls and tin ceilings , with hip family style tables . it ' s the best of old soho meeting new soho . finally the espresso . a nice bean . not as sweet or dumbed down as starbucks but just as smooth . they will make your latte with soy milk if you desire but i recommend you try whole milk and indulge . the crowd is international and smart . the hordes haven ' t descended like they have at eataly , but the food here is just as good . the atmosphere needless to say is better . 
after hearing a lot of positive reviews i was eager to try this place . my wife and i ate here this past friday and we left a bit disappointed . the arepa con choclo was so so . the corn tasted good , however , the arepa was quite dry and a little tough . the other stuff we ordered was better . my chicken in white wine was good , but could have been better if it was made with fresh garlic rather than the other kind . the sides of spinach and kale were good . the quinoa was excellent , and was the best thing we had . 
omg . i must say that i eat here at least twice a week . the food is superb and super-affordable . they have N beers on tab , and a bottle list twice as long . the staff will do anything for you , and there is always an owner around looking to say hi . if you have even the slightest inkling of coming here for dinner , stop reading this review and get your ass over there . and make sure you have the pretzel . 
this is referred to by drexel students as " bizarro new deck " mainly because of the same owners and same menu . the atmosphere is a little more . . . suave , and the clientelle are older ( not college kids ) . however the food is subpar compared to their first restuarant , new deck . if the food was on the same level , this would easily be N stars . 
great service , great food , my wife would order from them every night of the week if she could . they are super friendly and accommodating to us even though we often show up with N childrens . my childrens love their fried fish , chicken tikka masala . the food here is absolutely amazing . very fresh and authentic . 
looked like a mad men set--cheap Ns upholstery , but i guess that ' s what people are looking for now . food was good . they call it comfort food--i call it good diner food . a little overpriced , but worth it . sort of like a Ns upscale diner . not sure that ' s what they were looking to portray , but that ' s what i got out of it . had fried chicken basket , chicken pot pie ( excellent ! ) and meatloaf ( great peas ! ) . overall , go for the food but the decor didn ' t do it for me . 
i went there for lunch and was impressed . the portions are generous , the service was attentive , and the food was really good ! i would recommend this place to anyone ! 
upscale greek that is worth the money . . . . the estia chips ( zucchini and eggplant fried crispy served with tzatziki ) are delicious ! ! the salads very fresh lamb chops with roasted potatoes was delicious , a few people i was dining with had various fish entries and they all loved them
walking in on a cold fall night , it is not hard to understand why this popular brooklyn heights ' neighborhood restaurant is a big hit . noodle pudding simply oozes warmth , good italian food and friendly service . the prices are more than affordable , and you are dining in a romantic golden colored candle lit room . the menu focuses on classic dishes with an adventurous twist . the pappardelle with venison ragu was simple but yet so flavorful . although tiramisu was ordered on every other table , and looked very yummy , at the end of our meal i was simply too full to try . 
i travel the global and happen to be stuck in windsor locks and needed some great food . my wife and little daughter in toe food two whole foods in west hartford for breakfast and food this very charming town center filled with resturant and fabulous shops . as we strolled around we stumbled on this great tai restaurant . they had a great special for happy hour N apps between N-N at the bar only , so we tried them all and they were all great ! the owners are very much involved and was a pleasure speaking with . we never new west hartford had such great options for food . looking forward to coming back . 
love the place -it is nyc the beet salad was great roasted chicken better this is late night dining at its best
adequate . went to wasabi for lunch the Nst time after passing it by on the post road for years . the place is pleasant and clean , but i didn ' t go there for the decor . i ordered the sashimi sushi combo which came with soup and a small salad . the miso soup was fairly thin lacking the dashi kombu flavour you ' d expect . the salad came out of the cooler apparently , since the slice of tomato was stone cold ( and a bit crunchy - you know a " taco tomato " ) - how to kill a tomato N . the dressing was quite good the greens were romaine lettuce , a nice touch . the main dish was N pieces of sashimi ( maguro , sake ( salmon ) , hamachi ( i think , or white albacore ) . the nigiri sushi was a repeat of the above fish plus a piece of ebi ( shrimp ) which was quite good . there was an N-piece california roll bisecting the platter in an arc . very nice presentation . unfortunately , the fish was marginal , not in freshness , but in flavour and texture . there was no flavor except the barest hint of the fish . the " hamachi " did not have the sweetness associated with the fish leading me to believe that it was white albacore , but looking at the fish in the cooler at the bar , i really couldn ' t identify it . the maguro was equally bland and the salmon as well . texture , all of the pieces ( except the shrimp ) were soft and featureless . there was no mouth feel when chewing ( gumming ? ) them . i can only speculate that the fish was not defrosted properly or kept past its prime . i ' ve had this happen to me at sakura in westport ( twice ! ) about N years ago . the california roll was very good - the avocado was properly ripe the kani was just fine ( for kani - i ' m not a big fan of it , except only in oden ) . the other little niggling thing was that there was no wasabi placed on the nigiri ( or at least not noticiable ) had to supplement it with the wasabi provided . also , only low-sodium soy was provided ( a good brand , i ' ve used it a home ) , but i prefer the regular version since i ' m only dipping the fish in the soy ( not the rice ) so just the flavour is transferred . it is very difficult to get good sushi in ct , there were only N or three places which came close to those in westchester county ( nyc , but don ' t go there , i ' ll start crying . . . . ) , so i try to give the places here some slack . actually , the sushi area in whole foods , N min down the post road in milford has a decent but very limited selection ( maguro , sake , kani ) for nigiri rolls . the fish is very good , but please avoid the brown rice , sushi is rice brown rice adds too much of its own flavour , but it is whole foods ' ya know , the price for an equivalent amount is equal to the lunch deal here without the soup salad surroundings . i ' ll be back to see if this meal was an aberration , i sincerely hope so . 
the room is fit for many people whilst the ambiance is casual . the food deffinetely compensates for any negatives you may encounter . my family and i ordered summer roles which are almost always a must have at vietnamese restaraunts . also , we bermechelli salad . . . very tasty ( eaten at room temp ) , bahn mi sandwhich . . . to die for , and shrimp pho . . . the broth had just the right tang , saltiness , and sweetness . i ' d have to say , if you know what you ' re ordering , this place is not to be underestimated whether it ' s the other reviews or anything else . 
at leone ' s you are in for a real treat . a hearty italian fare . from rich pasta sauces , traditional soups , as well as dishes on the lighter side with delicate creamy lemon sauce . the restaurant is also known for its vegetables . . . the best sauteed broccoli rabe in jersey . once you taste the brickoven pizza , you can never look back . price ? surprisingly reasonable . overall a great family and fun environment . 
four stars for the steak tartar and burlesque on sundays . the drinks are damn good , yes but i ' m claustrophobic , which will explain why most of my reviews describe venues on monday afternoons . and i ' d much rather blow N on a few drinks at clover club or death co . which both make attempts at crowd control . employees only does not . heed the warning . tall , slim , fashionable and loaded are the few attributes to describe the crowd here . but the well-kept secret is snagging a table in the back and tucking into the steak tartar which is prepared table-side , with as much heat or acid as you ' d like . i liked . 
fool me once . . . shame on you ! fool me twice . . . shame on me . that bbq was horrendous ! their will be no seconds . come on now ! where are your taste buds . if , i were a food inspector i would close down more than N of these so called restaurants for selling tasteless , tough , nasty food . i passed this info to a friend who no longer reside in jersey . he asked what happened to all the good cooks ? i couldn ' t answer him . 
no substitutions allowed . how they designed to make each sandwich is the way you get it , regardless of allergies . sucked for my friend , but i respect that . bc my friend was allergic to carrots-- ingredient in every sandwich-- i was only able to try one . the special of the day mackerel . ( came back N N -- had the shrimp--great ! will seriously have to try the whole menu ) . the sandwhich is probably only N " long , and you think its small , but it is stacked high . better than baoguette ' s in my opinion . i am definitely coming back to try the whole entire menu . 
popular and funky pub on the outskirts of greenwich village . the place seemed cramped at first but i thoroughly enjoyed my night there . i just remembered having one too many brilliant long island iced teas and the rest is history . had to struggle to get refills throughout the evening but the bartender and her maze of tattoos were a nice spectacle . drinks are moderately priced and the upstairs room looks off balance- almost on an angle . had some addicting zucchini fries later and a few more shots . very casual setting- friendly staff and worth many more visits . 
i am gluten free and discovered this place through a gluten free network , but i have brought innumerable non-gluten free friends here and they have all loved it . many now regularly go for lunch or dinner without a gf companion . as for me , this is one of my favorite restaurants of all time . it ' s cute and small with great music and a fun waitstaff and the food is simply incredible . definitely italian comfort food at its best . 
tiny place . bar seating only and only room for about N people i think . got take out and the food is pretty decent . had a fish taco , pork taco , and the breakroom fries . the fish taco was alright . the pork taco was better . a bit more flavor in it and the breakroom fries is pretty tasty . a lot going on in it but still pretty decent . people were great inside . friendly and nice . overall a decent place for some variety by the edge of chinatown . 
i gotta say i ' m craving there pizza i haven ' t been there since october since i ' m in jersey
i first noticed this place in N when i went to get an ice cream cake for my husband for his Nth birthday in the area . i saw a huge line outside and wondered what the restaurant was so as soon as i got back home i went on yelp and looked it up . after reading the reviews and seeing the line i was convinced it was good . showed a couple of friends the place and tried to convince them to go with me but they backed out a couple of times then went without me ! humpfh ! they got back and kept raving about it . then morimoto came out and declared this place the best ramen in ny and i was really convinced i needed to try this place . i had a lot of failed attempts at going but finally we committed to coming here for dinner and i ' m glad we did . we went on a saturday night during prime dinner time and was told the wait was N hour and N minutes . not a big deal since we were expecting it and already decided that no matter how long the wait , we were going to eat at ippudo . so we walked to barnes noble and read some mags to kill time and came back just in time to be seated . you can even call after you put your name down and when it ' s closer to the time they gave you to see how much longer you have and the hostess will tell you when you should come back . as we entered the main dining room , we were greeted by all the waiters in japanese and seated at a community table in front of a mirror . it was weird to see ourselves staring back at us . ippudo definitely has space for large parties . most of their tables in the dinning room fit parties of up to N . we ordered the hirata buns with pork ( N for N ) . these buns were so yummie ! the pork with mayo and lettuce in the bun were perfect compliments to each other . i ordered the akamaru modern ramen while my husband ordered the shiromaru hakata classic , both with pork belly as toppings . my akamaru ramen was really flavorful but after eating it for a bit , i felt like the taste was very dark . i liked it but had to eat it slowly so i wouldn ' t upset my stomach . the shiromaru that my husband ordered was a lot lighter and the soup tasted more traditional . i think i ' ll be ordering that next time . we both loved the pork belly . it really made the ramen awesome . i read on the menu that if you don ' t finish all of your soup , you can ask for a second helping of ramen noodles for N more . my husband definitely did that and he was certainly full after his second helping of ramen . for dessert , we asked the waitress to recommend something and she recommended the annin tofu . it tasted just like a pina colada and was really refreshing after all the hot soup and ramen . the total before tax was about N for N people . one note about the bathrooms . they ' re downstairs to the right of the hostess when you first walk in . there are two bathrooms for women and one for the men . this is probably the only place i ' ve been to where the men actually had to wait for the bathroom vs the women . ) bathrooms are clean very nice . 
great ambiance great food their food was very unique . unique mediterranean i truly enjoyed every dish i was so glad one guy who was walking out said he need to try this restaurant so we did it was wonderful ! ! ! grilled figs and watermelon . very yummy . was very light and refreshing with watermelon after taste fico pizza . loved their thin crusted pizza . didn ' t think the middle part was cooked enough , but flavor was really good . tufoli calabrese . yummmmmm . . . i ' m going to try to make this one day love the pork in my ragu sauce delish ! fava bean arancini . pleasant surprise ! i don ' t like beans . i don ' t like cheese . but i loved this dish i didn ' t totally like the service . minus one star for that 
what an amazing place to eat . our server ( edwin ) was very kind and gave us a brief story on the restaurant ' s history . he was articulate with the descriptions and recommendations of the cheesecake options . i had the beef brisket with swiss cheese . my girl had the pastrami . both were delicious . our deserts ( cheesecake with strawberries and chocolate moose cheesecake ) were out of this world . we are from los angeles and have never experienced such delicious cheesecake . thank you edwin for a great experience . 
hi in response to lou p . review i totally agree . i work on the same block and often work late . for lunch it ' s my spot for a quick fix but last night i saw a kati roll truck doing deliveries and the employees smoking over the food bins . i watched them as they walked in and didn ' t wash their hands . they immediately started to prepare good for customers , very disgusting for such a popular spot . beware if ashes in your food yuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk . i tried to speak to delivery guy to tell him that ' s really inappropriate behavior and told me to " f " off . 
ich liebe brauhaus fur ihr bier , essen , und gefuhl ! i went here for my birthday because i ' ve been wanting to visit for the past N years , and i stopped in for both lunch and dinner . i actually visited during a spring festival celebrated by breweries and german restaurants called starkbierzeit or starkbierfest- literally strong beer fest . at this authentic restuarant that serves in appropriate glasses , typically by the . Nl or Nl , i found the starkbiers to be really awesomely priced , and not at all disappointing . i really can ' t say that i looked at the regular beer list , because i ' m really enthusiastic about german culture and thought i should stick with the N day opportunity . lunch prices were a lot cheaper , and i ended up getting a lot of little plates to try interesting sounding dishes off this german-first menu . the whipped duck fat was much too salty for us to finish , but i loved the spicy pickled sausages . the pickled vegetables were pretty typical , and i can ' t even remember the Nth plate i got so maybe it just wasn ' t memorable enough . or maybe i scarfed it down because it was incredible . the world may never know . we also got the hungarian stew , which was perfect for a meat and potatoes kind of guy , or someone intimidated by the menu . view their lunch menu here beta . brauhausschmitz . com later , after a day on south street , we stopped back for dinner and were charmingly greeted by our adorable waitress from lunch . we got the N cheese plate that was the most amazing set of pairings i ' ve ever had on a cheese plate , and the most substance per cost . incredible . they have N more variety plates for N , all look boss , but i would rather get the lachs for lunch than dinner . we also got the wienerschnitzel , which was everything i wanted , and the kartoffelpuffer ( potato pancakes with sour cream . ) each was boss . i love brauhaus schmitz . like , a lot . i wish i lived closer to it so it could be my new bar . i love the atmosphere , the staff , the spielen , and the tastes . best of the best , in my book . 
food was really good . restaurant was clean . popular with the locals . we went away satisfied . 
amazing subs , i usually go with a hot roast beef w mozarella and gravy . my only complaint is that there is no dedicated pickup line at the register . if you order ahead and go in when it is very busy to pick up subs you still have to wait for everyone to order and pay before you can even say you are picking up an order . 
love this restaurant . best byo we have ever found . this is our go-to restaurant for a consistently perfect meal . we love the pumpkin ravioli and the short rib ragu . incredible cheese plate for an appetizer . also , the brussel sprouts ( what ? brussel sprouts ? ) are so incredible as a side dish . so great that we are now believers in brussel sprouts . dessert is good too . . . if you have the room . you can feel the energy of the kitchen since the restaurant is so small . definitely expect a wait on the weekend , but they will take your cell phone number and allow you to have a drink across the street at valanni . 
a group of N went to caseus to celebrate a friend ' s birthday . we opened two bottles of wine and splurged to the tune of almost N . towards the end of the evening , one of us brought out a small birthday cake . to our flabbergast , we were charged N per plate per person . to further cheapened the experience , we were brought plates without forks and had to wait an agonizing N minutes before the forks arrived . by that time , the birthday candles have burned out . we spent N and we were charged N for plates to celebrate a friend ' s birthday . we left feeling sick , never to return , ever . 
i give this restaurant N stars , it " s one of my favorites . dined at many around new england , their fish and chips are the best i " ve ever had . service is good too ! the place is great ! ! ! i . 
ah-mazing . love love love despana and wish we had one here on the west coast ! ! i came here on one of my last days of my nyc vaca and was blown away with the quality of meats , cheeses and little bites . i bought a small fortune ' s worth of treats to bring back home ( can ' t wait to try the uni and lobster pate spreads during summer picnics ! ) but stayed long enough for some lunch . their signature despana sandwich is to die for . definitely stop in despana if you ' re looking for a quick bite or to buy little treats for family friends . 
i think this is my second favorite to difaras ( might be a tie with raginas in boston ) . love this place cuz its so cheap and the wait is never long and the pizza is amazing . 
was so excited when they moved into the old pizzeria uno ' s spot on Nrd ave . my friends and i went there a whole bunch of times when they first ordered . loved the beer battered string beans , the mashed potatoes , the bottles of water they give you for the table . and then it got really popular . it ' s obnoxiously loud , the food has suffered ( a lot ) and the politics involved in seating is more like being at a velvet roped club than a ( formerly ) cool , basically casual restaurant that can barely say it ' s " in " the east village . 
a group of friends got together for some fun and food on a saturday night and we all wanted to try papa ' s . i ordered the mussels marinara - the sauce was to die for - but all i got was empty shells - no mussels . so if you order mussels marinara be prepared to get a plate of shells , with sauce and bread . the owner came over to ask how things were and i told him i got a plate of shells with no mussels in them and his reply was i don ' t grown them - what kind of answer is that ? my husband ordered the stuffed artichoke appetizer and it was so dry he could not eat it . the pizza is alright i would not vote it N . my dinner was pasta , broccoli rabe and sausage in a wine sauce - it was all butter by the third bite i could not eat any more it was to greasy from to much butter and not enough wine . the waiter was wonderful but the owner seemed to have a problem with our table . so , guess what . . . . you won ' t see the N of us again . we dropped a pretty penny your way that night -- but not again . the only reason i gave you a star was because your marinara sauce was one of the best i have ever had . 
can ' t eat here everyday , or i ' ll simply explode , but it ' s that good . awesome for brunch lunch , but so crowded , even if they have lots of space in the back . chicken and biscuit . 
freshest seafood in philly . fairly basic though . you will not be blown away by flavors . just solid seafood . 
sliders were pretty darn good . i ' m not even a fan of onions and i couldn ' t help but devour N slider ' s with bacon . i think i could have gone without the extra N cents to add bacon . . . because i don ' t really recall any bacon ( it ' s mixed into the meat , and it was good enough that i think it would have tasted the same without ) . why only N stars ? it ' s the atmosphere . i understand we ' re in manhattan and space is a premium , but you ' re sitting so close to everyone else that it sorta ruins the moment . i don ' t recommend it for groups , and not for any type of date . therefore i ' m not sure what kind of occasion you ' d come here for . i came here with my brother after seeing the N . N star rating . the menu is basic simple enough that they have written on a window in the back of the room . sliders , sliders with bacon , vanilla shake , black and white shake , guinness shake , then other beer wine . pricing is pretty good . for N the portion of fries is large enough N people can share . 
we used to love single pebble -- it was one of our favorite restaurants in town . our last visit was late last summer and everything was delicious and the restaurant vibe just felt good . unfortunately on our recent monday night visit , we were very disappointed . service was friendly and reasonably attentive , but food was very slow coming out of the kitchen . our apps took about N N an hour and really whetted our appetite -- they were the only good food , and very good at that . we ordered the vegetarian pot sticker dumplings and an evening special crab cakes . both were light and well flavored , served w tastey sauces . all down hill from there . our vegetarian watercress soup was inedible due to an incredible salt overload . we never send food back , but no one in our party of N could eat this soup . the waitress handled it nicely and swapped it out for the hot sour soup , which was edible , but only fair , also due to super salty flavor . our main plates included mock eel , seitan sesame beef , ants climbing a tree , and lemon sesame shrimp . the seitan sesame beef was the best of the bad . we have loved that dish in the past , but it was greasy and salty . the ants climbing a tree and mock eel were also too salty . we couldn ' t eat the ants noodle dish , and the eel at first tasted good , but quickly the flavor of greasiness and the saltiness overpowered it . basically all these dishes started to taste the same -- salty and greasy . the shrimp dish was ok , but the sauce was too plain , no sophistication , and the shrimp had a kind of pastiness to their exterior . come on single pebble -- what gives . this used to be a quality restaurant , but this kind of cooking was like someone new to the kitchen took the old recipes and totally mucked them up . based on this dining experience i would be hesitant to go again , and would not recommend this restaurant to others . 
always a fun time here ! love the atmosphere . my favorite is the plantanos rellenos -- so good . i wasn ' t too impressed with the arepas or empanandas , i ' ve had better elsewhere . overall , it ' s a fun meal , i keep going back ) 
my husband and i ate here last night . unfortunately , we did not know we should have made a reservation . the wait was not too long . in the future we will . the food was delicious . we were each served a bowl of soup , which we enjoyed . we both had the twin lobster special . they were cooked to perfection . the potatoes were crisp . for dessert my husband had the creme brulee , which was fabulous . i ordered the flan . it was the best i ' ve had in a very long time . the service was impeccable . the staff was friendly and knowledgeable . we thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant , and will return the next time we are in n . j . sandy , florida
i and the N other people in my party agreed that umami burger was worth the N . N hour wait . just have someone from your party ( or everyone ) arrive N-N hours earlier than you would like to eat , put your name down and go to a nearby bar . they text you a link to a website where you can check how many parties are ahead of you and the anticipated wait time . easiest wait ever . so everyone at our table tried the thin fries , truffle fries , tempura onion rings , smushed potatoes , the original umami burger and the truffle burger . fries were nice and shoestring , although i think i prefer spotted pig ' s . truffle fries get soggy . tempura onion rings lack the crunchy , crispy onion ring fried battered shell that i love in onion rings . smushed potatoes were . . . just potatoes . . . smushed . the sauces they put out on the table are great , especially the spicier ones however , the umami ketchup is forgettable . all in all , ignore the appetizer menu unless you ' re starving and want something on the table as soon as possible . now onto the burgers . . . all the burgers are medium rare- perfect and charred with a little u on top . the burger sort of falls apart in your mouth , crumbles away . as my friends put it , it literally melts in your mouth . the original burger was good but there was a little bit too much tomato in my opinion . the parmesan crisp was a nice touch . the truffle burger- amazing . rich . truffle-y . nice salty finish . definitely the group ' s favorite . however , i only had half of it and was told that having the whole thing is a little too rich . burgers are a bit on the small side , so if you ' re starving , you can probably eat N . since we waited for so long and had some parties unfairly sat before us , the hostess hooked us up with free desserts- ice cream sandwiches from the good batch . this dessert review will not be that great because it was kind of a blur at this point i was undergoing major food coma as i had just had a late brunch clinton st . baking company N hours before and combined with everything else i ate , i wanted to die at this point . we had the double chocolate peanut butter ice cream sandwich which sat between N chocolate stroopwafels . now , i ' ve long since been a fan of dutch stroopwafels and their crispy outsides and gooey sweet centers . i don ' t think the stroopwafels in this sandwich contained the iconic gooey center of a classic stroopwafel- these were more like plain chocolate wafers . the second ice cream sandwich was paired between a chocolate chip cookie and something similar to momofuku ' s compost cookie , but in the classic style of umami , was more salty . that was delicious . all in all- easy wait , meh appetizers , great burgers , good desserts but then again who makes bad ice cream sandwiches ? 
i want to say minca has become very overrated . i was kind of shocked how flavorless their ramens were . my spicy miso was very salty but didn ' t have much flavor . broth was very thick and creamy . bf order the basic ramen with thick noodles , and the noodles were super hard like they weren ' t quite done . sad times . 
oaxaca kitchen proved to be the best find in new haven . i first visited this restaurant last year and had such a wonderful experience . the combination of delicious food , great drinks and an unbeatable ambience proved to be the ingredients for a fantastic evening out . the menu was not only fairly priced but also extremely well presented . the service was great and my group was made to feel welcome immediately . the manager and his team have continued to do an excellent job ever since our first visit . this is a must visit restaurant ! 
logeant dans ce quartier relativement loign de l ' animation de mid manhattan , ce fut pour nous une v ritable surprise de d couvrir ce restaurant au cadre sympathique et l ' accueil chaleureux . la cuisine est digne de la gastronomie italienne et les prix sont tr s raisonnables . happy to give the first opinion written in french with a view to inform a larger public
ovest is a reliably good pizzoteca on a quiet block in west chelsea . the atmosphere is low-key , but it gets busy during happy hour . this might be the best happy hour deal in the whole city they serve free food of all sorts at the bar , from pizza to vegetable dishes . you can eat dinner for free while imbibing -- it ' s lovely ! if you stick around for dinner , the food is quite good -- the pizza has great crust and is seasoned perfectly . this is a great stop for a post-gallery , pre-high line stroll date . 
love green basil ! awesome food great price ! love their curry puffs , drunken noodles , coconut soup , and thai ice tea ! ! so glad this place opened ! 
good beer from many different countries and really . good buffalo wings . you can ' t beat that . i wished the beer were colder and the burgers tastier but this place is solid . 
this place is great . ! ! ! i went on saturday night and they had live music . it was a dj and the music was good for the restaurant ( not too loud or weird ) . they told us we had a N minute wait but it ended up being N instead . the host was really nice . we got to sit outside on the patio which was good because it was cool out . for dinner my friend and i started with the chicken spring rolls which were really good . then i had the green curry chicken while she had the red curry . both were awesome ! the house chardonnay was a very generous pour and not tasting either . the prices were unbeatable but it is cash only ! i will absolutely go back to this place when i ' m in this area of brooklyn . if you are going to go i would go early and but my name on the list then wait at the bar . 
there is no question that the food here is spectacular . the kitchen is open until Nam ( on fri sat at least ) , which is essential because despite getting our name in at N Npm on a friday , there was an almost four hour wait . . . the house cocktails are bland and really overpriced . the steak special with beets , the burger and the oysters were all amazing . 
small sammie packing biiig flavors . the coconut tiger shrimp was a knockout , and i can ' t wait to come back to try others . the upstairs space is good for dining in - adequate seating for such a small place and big windows for fantastic people-watching . additional plus sriracha bottles urrywhere . 
great venue and great food . a nice romantic dinner or just fun times with friends . 
had lunch at cN and it was good . it ' s a cool spot and if you are in the mood for a fatty meal it ' s where you should head . had dinner here too , and was quite disappointed with the smoked spare ribs . they were very tough yet fatty , not a good combination . the corn bread and baked beans that they came with were pretty good . 
this is one filthy place to eat ! saw a rat running across when the kitchen door opened . when told the staff , i was asked to keep it down , then offered a discount . i was appalled ! disgusting ! ! ! 
when we first noticed that a pizza place was coming to towaco we were excited . having lived there since N and not having a local pizzeria was something new to the area ! the first day it opened we stopped to order a pizza . to our surprise there pizza is N " personal pizza ' s . since we are big eaters i knew N would not be enough . we ordered a margherita with chicken and a new yorker . both were good but we were disappointed with the toppings . love the concept of the wood fired pizza but we are traditional pizza eaters . big pie in a big white box ! plus we thought thirty something dollars for N pizza ' s was very pricey ! the place is geared to attract the so called " yuppy " folk of towaco and not the old timers that have live in the area for a long time . 
usually i have a problem with lobster rolls . i like them . i just don ' t like paying for them . well , a coworker and i decided that we were going to try out the lobster joint , though we have similar feelings about lobster rolls . so much claw meat ! and delicious fries ! tasty drinks and a really laid back space is going to make me change my tune about lobster rolls . 
very good food but . . . . not worth the long line and somewhat limited menu . i would tend to prefer telly ' s , loukumi taverna , and even bahari estiiatora over this . solid choice and great word of mouth advertising . -vitro
comida excelente ! principalmente a picanha , muito macia e bem feita ! pedimos pelo telefone e chegou rapidamente no hotel ! atendimento foi em portugu s ! recomendo ! 
nice local spot , just a little more than a hole in the wall . the live jazz drew me in . live music is always good . the menu is kind of all other the place . is it pub menu ( burgers ) , is it middle eastern ( hummus and grape leaves ) is it . . . ? i had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries and a beer . the veggie burger worked for me - it was made with red beans . you can ' t miss up sweet potato fries and they didn ' t . all was okay , but nothing to shout about . back to the jazz set . 
yum ! i love this place . the best part is the tonkatsu sauce . i don ' t normally like this type of sauce because i usually find it tastes too strong and too sweet but it is delicious from here . i ' ve tried the chicken katsu curry and last night i had the combination prawn and pork tenderloin katsu . the prawns were huge and tasted extra fried ( i guess that could be taken the wrong way but it was definitely delicious ) . my boyfriend had the kurobuta berkshire pork katsu . he thought it was soooo tender and flavorful ( he almost cried ) . he says that dish deserves N stars . ) coming here is fun . highly recommended . 
oh , diner . i had such high expectations for you . i had heard about your bloody marys and your burger . how it was the stuff of legend . i had also heard about the ridiculously long wait , so i ventured there on a sunday afternoon . . . brunch time . i walked in with my dining companion and noticed most seats were full , save a few spots at the bar . not ever having been there before , we stood in the doorway and waited for someone to take our names for the waiting list or direct us to a table . and we waited . and waited . several employees walked by for several minutes before one girl ( who had already passed us a handful of times ) stopped and mumbled , " would you like a table ? " she jotted down our names and directed us to the bar to wait . i was eager to try the bloody mary , but the bartender chose to basically ignore us . we were confused . . . we were sitting there , being attentive , not looking away or consumed in smartphone use . why were we not being served drinks ? too busy chatting with the regulars at the bar and taking shots with them ? that ' s cool and all , i love a laid-back bartender , but if you could swing by and ask if i wanted anything -- even just offering a drink menu -- that would be ideal . a couple who came in after us were seated before us . just as we were about to open our mouths to complain , we were led to a table . we barely looked at the menus . two grass-fed burgers , medium rare , with cheese , please . and oh yes , the bloody marys . and a coke for my friend . the bloody marys came out promptly . . . and left something to be desired . i am a voracious consumer of bloody marys and i seriously can ' t ascertain what the hype was about . it tasted painfully underseasoned . my friend never got his coke . but oh my god , the burger . the burger was everything i wanted and more . how often do you order a burger medium rare and it actually comes out medium rare ? but this was cooked perfectly , buttery , lightly seasoned , tasting more like steak than ground beef . my mouth is watering as i type this . sweet lord that burger is absolute perfection . when the check came , we asked to take the coke off , since we had never gotten it . our waitress stared at us for a minute , then looked at our table . no , there is no empty glass there . please just take it off the tab . anyway . service awful ( and it wasn ' t even that crowded ! ) , food transcendent . i will be back for that burger . hopefully the service will be better . 
food and prices are good . but man , the space in there . . . i felt like tuna in a can . i don ' t know why people say romantic and intimate . the sitting arrangement is N the same , so pretty much the next person to your right and left is literally about N inches from you and half an inch space with the seat behind you . i could see the texts from the girl sitting next to me and my foot crossed the girl ' s ' date ' s foot . kinda weird , but whatever . we went a few weeks ago at Npm and it was hot as hell , so consider the heat and sweat . it ' s all fresh air . if the place is filled and the host tells ya there ' s a wait , you can go to the bar next door have a few drinks , cause she said she will come and get you . our wait was N mins i waited almost N , so then decided to wait outside and coincidentally the girl saw us come out and bam ! the table was open and ready . i was like . . . umm hmm . so it ' s up to you if ya wanna just wait outside and be in the girl ' s sight , or go have a few drinks . overall , i liked the bolognese with pasta and their tiramisu dessert was really good , plus their bread and olive oil . 
this place is very good ! it was a little far from my job than anticipated , but worth the walk . my friend had the jane burger . it looked delicious and she said it was as well . i had the steak salad w fried potato strings on top . definitely a fan ! the steak was cooked to perfection . we would definitely return here ! 
hoagie haven is the best thing about the city of princeton . yes , even better than the all of the discoveries and humanitarian achievements of princeton alumni . for where else can one pick anything on the menu , find it delicious , plentiful and at a price more consistent with an earlier era ? enjoy
located on a busy highway route N , it can be easily found . very pleasant appearance and large space to accommodate plenty of people . banquet hall is also good where i attended one of my friend ' s son ' s birthday party . lot of space and very friendly staff . on top of everything , food quality is very good . it is very difficult to find such good quality indian food anywhere . i generally order party food from here and frequently enjoy delicious desi ( indian ) food here . i have visited plenty of indian restaurants , but very few match the quality food served here . for desi food connoisseurs , it is must to visit this place . 
i loved this place ! this was my first time having vietnamese sandwiches , and they were really good . i love that they have vegetables and are fresh . delish ! ! 
dear goodness this place has every italian item you could want . i walked in to look around and was mesmerized by the walls of cheese and meat . everything looked amazing . i walked in right before the lunch rush and as i was wandering around noticed that the lines were growing quickly . stopped by the caffe lavazza and grabbed a delicious beverage while perusing . i ' ll definitely be heading back the next time i ' m in new york . perfect place to pick up supplies for a picnic or dinner party . the prices are steep , but worth the occasional splurge . 
tuna stuffed jalapeno tempura ? yes , please ! on a recent visit back to philly a girlfriend told about this little gem . it ' s in my old neighborhood and just down the street from my all time favorite brunch spot - sabrina ' s - off Nth and callowhill . on the last evening of my visit , two friends and i dropped in for dinner with N bottles of wine in tow . immediately i liked the soothing , minimalist decor and hanging tea lights that dangled from the ceiling of this sleek little byo . we did not have reservations , but were seated promtly and it was pretty busy for a sunday night . between the three of us , we shared four sushi rolls , plus the stuffed jalapeno appetizer and spicy edamame . everything was great and the fish was fresh and tender . it ' s definitely a good addition to the restaurant scene and since many neighborhood sushi places are pretty small it ' s nice to have options , especially when the sushi cravings strike ! 
we heard good things about a ' s , and tried it on a late july sunday afternoon . got a quiet table in the back and had an interesting conversation with the neighboring table ( frequent visitors ) . drinks were a little pricey , but quite good sized . had the arugala salad , calamari and one order of veal adriana for two seniors- almost too much food . it was all delicious and the wait staff was attentive and engaging . overall , a very nice experience and one we look forward to repeating . 
another new york pizzeria with a reputation for having some of the best pie around . it ' s good , but it isn ' t that good however , don ' t mistake that statement for it being bad . i ' ve seen some reviews mention having to wait in line , but i must ' ve had good luck each time i went as i got seated right away . as an aside , the atmosphere and decor isn ' t what you ' ll come back here for . the pizza is good , but i think now lombardi ' s reputation as a pizza institution precedes itself and the flavor just doesn ' t match . 
this is the real deal burger place in the world . literally . it invented the hamburger . it is in the library of congress saying so . texas inventing the hamburger ? how long has texas been around ? do the math . the burgers here are awesome . cooked in a way that none other do . old school place with history . no condiments allowed . . . awesome . if you get caught sneaking some in , you ' re kicked out . ha ! awesome . psst , across the street is great new haven pizza at bar . get it all in . 
i ' ve never fancied crepes , but beau monde makes some pretty good ones . i tried the egg , sausage , tomato sauce and goat cheese crepe . it was amazing . my daughter loves the beau monde pizza , which she calls ' pizza chip . ' we liked it so much that we went back the next day . down side is the bill can be pricey if you add in drinks and dessert . 
came here after drinking all day on governor ' s island for dinner . we were told there would be a N minute wait so we grabbed some drinks . N minutes later we ' re being led to our table . of course we all order the burgers . this place gives shake shack a run for their money . the burger is big , juicy , and flavorful . plus those onion strings are bangin . the only downfall i saw was the cheese , its just too overpowering . the burger stands on its on , no need for the overpowering cheese . i think american cheese or something not as strong would be a better option for this burger . 
the food was bad , the service was worse . i won ' t be going back . 
this place has amazing wings and burgers . i must admit , i was never a fan of wings until i had them at bonnie ' s . the burgers are delicious , especially with their chipotle sauce . the service is not great the staff can be very rude . also , it is tiny and many times there are no available tables . i dont mind sitting at the counter but its pretty uncomfortable and loud . . . . oh so loud in there . with all the traffic they get in there , u would think that they ' d expand . my N stars are for the food . . . . and only the food . 
i have been reading and hearing a lot about this place and wanted to try this for a long time . i work on broadway and Nth and never got time to try this at work . so today i drove into the city after coming from work . luckily no traffic in lincoln tunnel and was at the place in N min . enough of the venture . . let me review the food now . . . the food is good but not great ( great as in " oh i need to try this in nyc " ) . lamb and chicken were both ok . . white sauce was nothing special . . . the hot sauce is very hot though . . its similar to every other halal chicken served by the street vendors . i guess the yelp reviews and being open late added to the hype . when compared to the chicken from the cart on broadway and Nth ( there are two carts . . i usually go the cart which is in between the potato cart and another halal chicken cart ) this chicken doesn ' t cut it . the broadway and Nth cart guys serve green sauce , beans on the side . . the basmati rice is flavored and is awesome . fried egg plant and cilantro add a nice touch . . . my trip was not worth it to the Nrd and Nth . . . if i was working next to it . . may be i will grab lamb and rice once in a yr . . on the other hand , i have eaten at the cart on broadway and Nth , about four times in the last N weeks . there is another truck that serves on near Nth and Nth which is great as well . . . i would like some one working in the city and report the same as well . . . . 
fantastic food , buck-a-shuck oyster specials for happy hour , and almost everything else we ate was superb ! ( the only thing that wasn ' t fantastic there were the fries . they were just good ! ) service was exceptional i have a food allergy and the waiter was by far the most competent waiter to deal with this ever in our experience . ask for brion , he ' ll take great care of you ! 
this place is the real deal ! great people who own the place ( a cute little couple ) great atmosphere , great beer selection and awesome food . i like that i get to choose my beer from the many beer fridges that hawthornes has . there are people there to help you for recommendations if need be . their breakfast and lunch kick but . the best meals that i have had at hawthornes are the hummus in their mediterranean plate , many breakfast items . eggs benedict , french toast ( i ' ve never seen nor eaten any french toast like this before ) home-fries , these little puppies are seasoned and cooked with the best crisp texture . s . o . s . ( cream chipped beef ) and best coffee . i know , i know best coffee ? yup just try it black and in the french press , and you ' ll agree . this competes with sabrinas for best brunch . as for lunch there sandwiches are a little on the pricy side but , you get stuffed . sandwiches come with homemade chips and a pickle . dinner ! curry mussels awesome , braised short rib , and there crab cake is very good . this place is very clean , and very cute with a little living room that i have shared many beers with perfect strangers . staff is friendly and accommodating . my partner is allergic to nuts and wanted to try their pesto pasta he asked if there was pesto without nuts . the server says " no but let me check " . N minutes latter here comes a plate of pesto pasta . they made fresh pesto for him ! 
came here for the first time on monday night with my fianc . what a great spot . the ambience was great and the food was simply amazing . the service was impeccable ! the waitress suggested a really nice bottle of wine . hudson valley pinot noir which i highly recommend . we also had the clam special and grilled octopus as appetizers . my fianc had the butcher steak ( which was good full of flavor but was a little tough for my liking and i had the patty melt and omg it was so yummy . the long beans and fingerlings potatoes were great side dishes . we also had the pecan pie which was very good too . we will be coming back very soon
great ! 
this is awasome ! ! ! 
so i ' m in nyc at the car show and decide on bbq i get my car and drive to rubbs on N street only to discover it has been closed forever ( ( i then use yelp and discovered this place . i must say this place is awesome . 
i went into lovers and madmen the other day to sit down and get some coffee , and had not a single positive aspect to the experience . i sat down at a table before ordering to take off my jacket and text a friend . less than a minute after sitting down , the barista came over with a foul and rude attitude , and told me that i had to buy something to sit at a table . it was apparently unacceptable to sit down for a second without giving them my money . i then ordered a very overpriced tea , and the barista again gave me attitude . look out for him he is a rubenesque ( fat ) guy with a slight lisp . i had to wait N minutes for the tea even though there couldn ' t have been more than N people there . the jerk barista didn ' t really seem to be in a hurry i heard him talking on his phone in the back while i waited . when it came , the tea was luke-warm . when i asked if i could have it hotter , the guy sighed dramatically and rolled his eyes . i will not be going back again , mostly because of how rude the barista was . 
N of us were heading down to nj via the merritt and i was told that we should have lunch at your place . worst restaurant experience i have ever had ! ! ! it took N hours to get out of there , and it wasn ' t even busy ! ! ! all we heard from our server ( creepy guy with a mustache beard ) is that it was the gun clubs fault for not calling in their order ! there were only N of them , and a table with N other people so that excuse was totally lame . finally , towards the end of our nightmarish visit i called him on it and said . . . . . " dude , you really put us behind our schedule , if it took half the time to get our food that would have been bad , the service here was just horrible ! " . he started in with the excuses again , to the point that the girls got up and left and went to the car and me and my friend couldn ' t even look the guy in the eye . . . . . . here i was complaining about the service and this knucklehead is spending yet more time making excuses again , i felt like saying , look jackass , you just don ' t get it , go back and get us our check already ! ! ! it was N , we gave him N , which was way to much . i will never set foot in your place again , and i will copy paste this to every possible website . i can ' t believe you ' ve stayed in business this long ! ! ! steve
i came here with my mom and friend on a thursday night . was nicely crowded with people , but not overwhelming . food was good , but not overwhelming - i had a gorgonzola and blackberry flat bread which was nice . i think my mom had salmon and my friend had steak . the kitchen is an open-style so you can see the chefs preparing food which is kind of nice . it is what i expected of a rittenhouse byob - airy , light green atmosphere , waitstaff in white , and simple somewhat creative new american food . it was good to take my mom to - nothing too adventurous or romantic or filled with loud younger crowd . im in no rush to head back , but if someone told me they really really wanted to go or they were having their bday dinner there , id go and wouldnt be upset . 
awesome food ! ! ! went with family last week , had the holi special thali and food was amazing . sanjay
went there with a large group we all ordered their prix fixed menu and every dish was great and just N pp it was a great deal
fantastic pizza ! good from the first bite . there is never enough to eat . the waiters are very friendly and knowledgeably . 
very good food for lunch . pasta and chicken parmigiana were very good . would recommend it to anyone . 
first time here and was happily surprised with the level of detail put into the appearance of the food . the seafood ravioli tasted very fresh and perfectly cooked . service was also very good and paced well . 
very pleased to try the noodle station this evening . the abundant portions were quite reasonably priced . the noodles , sauces , meats proteins and vegetables selections offer the diner a multitude of options to satisfy his her palate . if you are a loyal customer of the china station , you will quickly recognize some of the friendly staff who greet everyone with a big smile . my family and i welcomed the opportunity to quench our asian and italian appetites all in one setting - where else around here can you do that ? delicious ! no mater what you order , you will most likely be taking some leftovers home to enjoy later because they do not skimp on any of the noodles , meats , sauces or vegetables . don ' t forget to save room for dessert ! the swirl pearl yogurt bar offers so many choices , everyone is sure to found a winning combination to satisfy his her sweet tooth . kudos to the noodle station ! we will definitely be back to dine again . 
other than the trucks by university place , i dislike most of the eateries around here . however , jg domestic is one of the few places i love eating at . the cocktails and the food here are superb , and the price doesn ' t do much damage to the wallet as well . well kept , and amazing staff , had the pleasure of cracking jokes and enjoying my time here with simon . definitely would recommend ! 
i went to cubana social a few weeks ago and have been thinking about it ever since . the atmosphere is great and i was seated right away . i got an amazing cocktail that my server helped me pick out and it was exactly what i wanted . the food was fantastic . to be honest , i don ' t know why i had never been before or heard how good this place is . i shared some appetizers and small plates with my friend . everything we ate tasted really fresh and had so many flavors . i went on a friday night and they had a live band playing . the music was great and everyone in the restaurant was clapping to the music . it was just a great overall experience . it ' s my new spot ! 
stopped in here on a recent trip to philly and man am i glad i found this place . amazing selection of german beers and really great german food . i ' ve tried the bauernwurst and man was that smokey and absolutely delicious . it came with apple sauce as my side and that made for one tasty lunch . definitely drop in if you ' re around the area and you won ' t be disappointed . 
so before i start , i have to say , i grew up in nyc and worked in a deli most of my life . my blood runs rampant with the nitrates from boars head . i may only live to N , but my body will be pickled forever thanks to brunkhorst meats in their shiny red and black trucks . i was spoiled as far as delicatessens go . so , everything is based off that bias . the sandwiches are expensive but they are huge . i am an eater . i have been known to pack away N ounces of prime rib at a time and then finish my wife ' s left overs . that ' s why i go to the gym so much . i had the penn special , and man , i had to leave N N for later . as far as the flavor , some of the meats lack flavor . the salami is good , but the toungue left something to be desired . it lacked flavor . the texture was good , but it just lacked flavor . its a nice deli , good portions , and if i pay ten bucks for something that makes me wait to finish it later , i think its a good deal . it would be N stars all the way if the flavor was a bit better with some of the meats , but i think i found a place to keep the nitrates pumping in my veins ! ! woohoo . even better is the fact that i don ' t have to go there . delivery through campus food . com . i havenever actually been in there , maybe one day . 
stopped in for weekend lunch a few weeks back . worth the schlep to red hook . this is some righteous que ! we got pulled pork and brisket sandwiches . they serve the sauce on the side like any bbq veteran knows , this should be used sparingly and is optional . the side of beans and mac n ' cheese were just eh . but it ' s great that the meat was stellar . the full bar in the front room has some great beer options and an excellent bloody mary . tvs in multiple locations , some video games for the kids and big kids at heart and even a spot for some live entertainment . looking forward to coming back for dinner
excellent spot for a bottle of wine and sitting out on rittenhouse square any night of the week
strawberries tattoos - sounded like an interesting dessert . . . and yes it was indeed . . . N mini standing ice cream cones , never served with the same flavors because everything is always made fresh and with whatever ingredients they were able to score in the last few days . the sugar ice cream cone itself is worth ordering this dessert . my N flavors were cranberry , caramel popcorn , coffee , some kind of donut flavor , and the last i can ' t remember because stands up my name is antonella and i have a drinking problem sits back down ahh marc you never disappoint me . . . 
baby blues is an interesting and unique find , located conveniently between drexel ' s and penn ' s campus . i wasn ' t sure what to expect when going in for the first time , as i ' ve never been a big barbecue person but i was very pleasantly surprised . i got the pulled pork platter ( there was a lot of meat for your money ) with the sweet potatoes and mac n cheese . the pulled pork was absolutely amazing ( very juicy and flavorful ) , especially with the apple cider vinegar which was definitely the perfect compliment to it . the sweet potatoes were probably the best i ' ve had so far , they were quite sweet and had the ideal consistency for mashed potatoes . and although i ' ve never been much of a mac n cheese person , my waitress had advised me to give a try because it was really good and she was right ! it was very unique with the different cheeses they used and i liked the little extra oomph it had . clearly , i now am a regular of baby blues . the place is almost always buzzing with energy along with good music . you always get a lot of food for your money and the menu has an insane amount of new things to try . the staff have always been very personable and attentive and they definitely make you feel welcome . all of the waitresses and waiters are very good about answering questions concerning the food and drinks . i continue to be impressed and i highly recommend you give it a try ! 
a very good , solid place for brunch , though nothing particularly special . order the mimosas ! 
been here a couple times never disappointed but i haven ' t really tried to many things . it had been great so far ! 
just opened N weeks or so . i ' d give this some time to adjust . nice selection of tapas . will be back at a later date . great decor and atmosphere . reasonably well-staffed . 
found this place through yelp after a beautiful walk across the williamsburg bridge . N minute wait on a saturday at prime brunch time . very cozy space . overall the food was fantastic . we ordered a variety of things . the raspberry scone was packed with flavor . steak and eggs was delicious and came with nice side of seasoned potatoes and salad . egg frittata with asparagus was cheesy and oh so good . but i can say that the best thing we had was the side of bacon . never have i had such mouth watering bacon before . slightly sweet and literally melt in your mouth . our waiter was awesome . overall wonderful dining experience . 
good was ok . our friends meals were cold . service was slow . they couldn ' t fugue out how to do multiple credit cards . 
our waitress kept our beers coming quickly and we did not have to wait long to get our food . i got a piece of blueberry cornbread from the sides menu for an appetizer and it was delicious moist , with just the right amount of sweetness from the blueberries . i wanted to get the burger with the cheese inside , but i only eat red meat well done and the waitress said if i got that burger well done , all the cheese inside would cook out anyway , so i might as well get a regular burger , which i did . i am not a huge fan of red meat so i rarely get burgers but was in the mood for one , and it was good by my inexperienced standards . the best part of it was the combination regular potato sweet potato french fries . they tasted fresh and homemade , not too greasy , with just salt and pepper sprinkled on . they made the whole trip worthwhile ! also they had the phillies game on multiple tvs , so how could the meal not have been good ? 
speechless
after the crazy wait , i find that this place does N thing outstanding . the broth is incredible . after that the noodles and toppings are good . love the welcoming routine and beautiful decor . very happy staff and place . overall i ' m still a fan of toto ramen more . 
probably the best risotto i ' ve ever had , and it ' s gluten free ! friendly service and nice neighborhood feel combined with great food make this a bleecker street fav . tip start with the meatballs in bolognese sauce and use the gluten free breadtsicks to dip in the sauce . small seating area can get tight and crowded very quickly and the wait can be up to an hour on weekends , well worth it though . 
i kind of like the no frills decor and the service was friendly but i really disliked the food . when you have only N items on the menu , you would think they would be perfected . we had N of the N . the salad was so salty it was inedible . , pulled pork was soooo dry it was like eating wood slivers ( i did like the grits gravy ) , and the fried chicken waffles was a breaded , dry like it had been heated N times before , chicken breast on basically a flavorless eggo . we also had hush puppies which for some reason tasted like falafel and the last item was forgettable ( literally ) . i visited in early summer so i hope they are heeding other similar reviews . this place could be awesome but it ' s horrible . i hate to diss the chef but its really not hard to do good comfort food consistantly . i hope the best for them but unless they change some things around . . i don ' t know . 
i really just love diner . granted , i ' ve only been there twice , and only for brunch , but i ' ve had a great experience both times . the service is very good , and the food is just fantastic . i love that the menu is simple but everything that is put out is interesting and delicious . i simply could not get enough of my ricotta pancakes with cherry compote . all in all , a great experience , and i cant wait to check out dinner sometime . 
due to all of the favorable reviews , my friend and i expected to have an enjoyable meal here recently , but we were shocked to encounter one of our most disappointing restaurant experiences ever . we showed up on time for our reservation and were assured multiple times that our table would be ready soon . we ended up having to wait N min for that table . despite asking repeatedly for a menu to look at while we waited , we were ignored . finally , after we were seated , my friend ' s raised hand and request for bread were also ignored several times , even though waiters made eye contact with her . the attitude completely prevented us from enjoying our meal . i don ' t know if that night was just an anomaly for this restaurant , but we certainly weren ' t the only ones with a bad impression because the woman at the table next to me was also upset and frustrated . 
eataly . having been to the original eataly in italy , i can attest a certain level of experience that i expected to be carried over into this food mecca when it hit the states . when i first heard about it coming to the usa , i thought " wow what a great idea " . then when i heard all the stories about the nightmarish spaces being considered for it ( like rockefeller center ) , that ' s when my concerns arose . but in the end , when i heard that over Nk sq . ft . were being allocated , i thought " okay , maybe it can work " . at first glance eataly looks like a great idea . but as soon as you start to walk around ( or shuffle about as is more the case ) , you begin to realize that this place is trying to be too much in too small of a space . not only are the aisles to narrow for the back to back product displays , but i am also willing to bet that it is also dangerously tipping the occupancy and safety regulations . not a place i would to be stuck in during an emergency . i found the prices to be mostly on the high side , while the portions were on the low side . some items familiar to me from my other favorite italian specialty shops across the country , cost much more at eataly . i am by no means a food snob , but when i go to an italian specialty shop , i expect my senses to be enveloped with the heavenly aroma of the products . at eataly , the most you get to inhale is a touch of seafood and espresso . i also expect to deal with employees that are very knowledgeable about the products know how to pronounce the italian names , how they can best be used , and how one might compare to another . at eataly , garnering insightful knowledge from the staff is the last thing you should expect . on the bright side , i will say that i do have a fondness for some of the imported products they stock . and that some of the restaurant staff is quite excellent . but again , i just can ' t let go of the fact that i don ' t get that authentic italian market shopping experience that can be had at nearly two dozen other smaller but well established shops throughout the five boroughs of new york city . 
have had dinner here a few times and i have to say it holds up . the bone marrow poppers are delicious - as is the salmon and the apple ' tufahija ' dessert ! the fraise sauvage was quite refreshing for a strawberry infused beverage and pretty much all of the gin cocktails are fabulous ! great date place too - love that they take reservations ! have gotten really lucky with last minute rezzies on a friday night -- thanks eric ! 
i have been here several times and never had a bad meal . the food always comes out hot and the ingredients are high quality and very fresh . the desserts are amazing - the coconut mousse is great and i recently had the chocolate gelati which was delicious . i would highly recommend this restaurant . i look forward to going back again . 
i went to graces trading company for a work dinner and my eyes lit up the second i walked in . the restaurant is dark and trendy -- i loved the thin , wooden , high top tables and big windows . even more , i loved the olive oil taps that lined the bar area and the glass containers filled with perfect macaroons . the whole place had a bit of a parisian feel to it . our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu . they had a decent drink menu and we started off with some beers from the tap ( dogfish head pumpkin for me ) and some bread with the house olive oil and sea salt . for food , my three co-workers decided to share a few things but i selfishly decided to order on my own . but first , we shared the cheese plate -- it came with N goat ' s milk cheeses ( which change daily ) and an accompaniment for each . i loved this cheese plate -- the accompaniments were so thoughtful and unique . for my entree , i ordered the pappardelle with lamb ragu . the pappardelle was cooked perfectly and the lamb was very tender , but i found the sauce to be just slightly underseasoned . my coworkers shared two salads and two flatbread pizzas , all of which they enjoyed . i didn ' t pay ( woo hoo ! ) but i think all of the prices were very reasonable for the quality . overall , a great experience and one i ' d recommend to locals and tourists alike ! 
the food here is spectacular . highly recommend the lamb neck , the escolar ( it ' s sous vide and scrumptious ) , the bahn mi poutine , and the rabbit ( which i have found few places do well ) . in terms of dessert go with the sticky toffee pudding - the pepper ice cream is amazing , not to mention the pudding itself . service is a little laid back and i love it , but naturally depends on you . 
bad service , food nothing special
bar bites ! mmmmmmmm . so good . the bison bites are also quite amazing . and the bacon cheeseburger ? oh my god . . woodntap definitely has the best cooked burgers , in my book , in orange . and they are reasonably priced . . ish . . . could be cheaper but honestly they cook it exactly as you request it . . i work at a store right down the street and if i ' m closing , my buddy and i always run in there and grab a couple beers and some bar bites , for him bison bites . did i mention they have a freakin ' amazing beer selection ? and the staff is very polite and fun to be around . 
we came into an empty restaurant and were seated immediately . the service was very friendly , very polite , and accommodating . our waiter was very attentive , nice to the kids , made helpful suggestions , albeit a little slow . on to the food we had some rolls , some edamame , seafood curry , pad thai with tofu , and some curry thai . i realize that our choices were not very adventurous , but we were looking for comfort on a wet , cold , miserable day . the pad thai was probably on of the most pleasant i have had in a long time . the curries were not that great . i am a fan of vietnamese curries and i had asked for extra spice , but it was not spicy at all . the seafood selection in the curry was also a bit scant . would i try again ? maybe , but with so many other possibilities in the area , i would need some convincing . 
so i came back like i said i would and this time i went with people who were hungry . i was able to try a lot more than just the mac n ' cheese , though somebody did order that based on my recommendation . to start , we got the calamari and the mussels . . . i love the sauce the mussels are cooked in and the mussels tasted very fresh , though i wish they were a little bigger . somebody else got the salmon , which i tried , and it was very moist and flaky . i got the pasta of the day which happened to be linguine carbonara . . . that was one of the best pasta dishes i ' ve ever eaten in my life . the bacon was crispy , the linguine was cooked to perfection , it was peppery , and it was topped with one of my favorite cheeses- parmesan-reggiano . of course , there was room for dessert after all of this . we got the creme brulee , which was earl grey tea-flavored and the vanilla pound cake with a blueberry sauce . the creme brulee tasted like green tea ice cream ( that ' s a good thing , for me at least ) and my friend thought the pound cake was dry , but i thought the opposite . it isn ' t as crumbly as an entenmann ' s , but it still had some texture to it . we ate both desserts though . all this , plus two ice teas , tax and tip , came out to N . a meal like this in the city would have easily gone for N- N and it probably wouldn ' t have been quite as good . i ' m definitely come back during the summer to check out the garden , but i have a feeling i ' m going to have to get there pretty early to snag a seat ! 
bad experience . i wanted to love this place though . food ok service terrible . 
this place has probably surpassed han dynasty in quality of food although nothing can beat the ambiance at han ' s new old city location . this is an excellent addition to the neighborhood ! 
caf bello was my date selection ideal for our Nnd outing . upon entrance we immediately were seated by the host . coming through a dimmed lit modern bar lounge area to be escorted to large water colors painted walls of old european caricature dining area . our server was pleasant and intuitive . he came to our table at the appropriate moments without being prompted . as the dining area filled up with guests , it was still intimate enough for my date and i to hear , laugh and glaze at each other . for appetizer , we shared " bruschetta alla toscana - whole wheat bread topped with fresh tomato , basil , garlic and parmigano . " our entrees were petti di pollo a piacere , my date had frances and i had marsala , which i had better . the frances was on point , just the right about of lemon zest . the lovely outing was wrapped with dessert orange sorbet and chocolate , peanut butter cheesecake . i can ' t speak to the cheesecake because i ' m allergic to chocolate but that orange sorbet - the presentation said Nst class , it was like eating fresh frozen orange . we continued to experience superior service from each server , regardless of his role at cafe bello . 
i really wanted to love this place . i have been wanting to check it out for some time so was excited when we finally set aside some time to stop by . well , as soon as you walk in , it is crowded , loud and there is no " flow " to the store . people are walking everywhere amongst diners , and there are little nooks of food shelves . i thought there would be more interaction , but you kind of have to know what you want before you get there to get the most out of the place . browsing is somewhat hard with the crowds as well . at first we thought of eating there , but every place had a huge line , so we began looking around for some take out options . so when i finally did buy a few things , thanks in part to a helpful employee in the olive oil section , i really wanted to hate the place and not come back - ever . however , once i got home to actually eat what i bought , everything was so delicious ! the bread , mozzarella , prosciutto , oil and balsamic amounted to a great meal . ( albeit an expensive one , but the oil and balsamic were the most expensive part - i can use it for subsequent meals . the bread meat cheese were all reasonably priced ) so , will i go back ? maybe . . . if i ' m in the area and feel like braving the madness . next time i might try the fresh squid ink fettuccine . 
i am not a typical yelp user but after my experience at vitae on friday , i decided to provide a review . friday was my second visit to vitae N time over the summer on business and this past friday as a personal visit which was my wedding anniversary . we are not fussy types - mid N ' s , married N years - and actually didn ' t ask them to treat us in any special way when i made the reservation . to start , we were greeted with complimentary champagne . throughout the meal every person working in the restaurant said happy anniversary to us , and i mean every person . agree with others that the menu isn ' t the largest , but everything we ordered was very good . N ) cheese plate , N ) pork taco ' s , N ) salads , N ) pork chop , N ) cod . note we also unknowlingly ordered a fish that my wife may have been allergic to ( the artic char ) and the restaurant took it back without a blink . after declining desert we were presented with a plate with small chocolates , homemade ice cream and the words happy anniversary written in chocolate . as we exited they again wished us a happy anniversary and thanked us for coming . thank you vitae ! 
i had the shrimp jalapenio grits was okay but the shrimps were overcooked . was there for a large party , average meal . for this price point there are many other great restaurants in the city . 
i ' m belgian ( on my mothers side ) and beside my aunt this place has the best fries . . . 
love this place . i had almost everything on the menu and wasn ' t disappointed . the vibe is cool , the prices are great , the staff is very friendly . the pickled peppered wings are amazing ! i wish they served brunch every day . other then that i highly recommend this place if your looking for a chill spot and some good eats . 
best pizza ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i will eat it each and everyday
awesome restaurant very cosy candlelit . basement room has live jazz . very beautiful patio . great italian food ( loved their minestrone ) . only con was waitress pushy to make us get more things to order and very slow . 
best beef tendon and fish ball soup i ' ve ever had ! ok , honestly first time i ' ve never had either of them . very good . the hand drawn noodles are much more substantial than what you find at a typical chinese restaurant . small place , so don ' t be surprised if you get doubled up at a table with other patrons already seated eating . actually adds to the atmosphere . the service is very good as well , you ' re seated quickly and have your bowl of noodles in minutes . the guy next to us had the seafood noodle bowl with clams , scallops , and i believe mussels . can ' t wait to go back and try that one . 
pretty solid place . we came here on a weeknight during what would usually be a packed time , but we pretty much walked right into seating . menu is diverse and well organized , and can offer pretty much whatever italian fare you can think of . we opted for the veal cutlet , the veal parm ( with a side of the special squid ink pasta ) , and the bolognese . everything was really solid here , my coworker said the veal was some of the best she ' s ever had , and the squid ink pasta was really solid . my bolognese was cooked perfectly al dente , really rich meaty flavor , and not overly seasoned . overall , its a solid italian place with decent prices ( we walked out under N a piece which is pretty good for nyc food ) . the one compliment i ' d have to give is the portion sizes are just about right , not too large not too small . won ' t blow you away , but offers solid food , and above average service . 
this is an amazing spot in williamsburg . highly recommend . 
yes , five but i ' m boycotting it . lets see how long before my craving for the most amazing pizza ever makes me punk out and cave in . N dollars a slice , ok we pay that for coffee in nyc but the wait , omg the wait . over an hour and a half for a pie . with that delicious smell and hot bubbly pizza coming out of the oven and staring you in the face . ok i can even handle that , it ' s the fact that there is no rhyme or reason to how the orders are placed and who gets their slice pie first . if you are a germaphobe skip the place the tables are always gross ! 
ended up here late at night after drinks-- it ' s a small , dinky place in china town , without just enough room to fit maybe N in front of the counter . behind the cashier you can see several people making the dumplings in enormous pans , apparently nonstop . unfortunately , i wasn ' t particularly hungry , but my friends were happy to let me steal some of their dumplings . i don ' t know what they do to make them taste so good , but somehow , past the extremely oily and hot texture , you ' ve got a really tasty dumping , to top it off , the price is simply unbeatable-- N dumplings for N is unmatched . looking to return soon when i ' m a bit hungrier . 
excellent food . so so service . 
the first time i visited vida was for lunch with a friend . the owner chef , silva , was in the kitchen behind the counter preparing meals for everyone . i ordered her cuban black bean soup and have been a fan ever since . nowhere , not in miami beach , not in any spanish restaurant , have i had such delicious black bean soup . i can name other specialties on the menu at vida , but i would like to urge everyone to go there and have a meal in silva ' s dining room . the decor an ambiance are beautiful and relaxing . service is friendly and attentive . i am a fan and hope to keep vida alive and thriving on staten island . 
i went there for dinner and wanted to order chicken parm . they wanted N dollars for the dinner ! i ordered a sandwich instead because it was the only reasonably priced thing on the menu . it was ok , but it felt like the waitress was giving me the bum ' s rush for ordering something cheap . did not enjoy myself at all . 
love this place ! ! went with a friend and we ordered a variety of things off the menu . everything was delicious and the price was very reasonable ! they have many different varieties of arepas . . . yummm i can ' t wait to go back ! ! 
not only is this the most delicious halal food ive ever had , its the most delicious food ive ever had period . every forkful of juicy lamb mixed with rice , hot sauce , and white sauce is a little slice of heaven here in nyc . i drive N minutes to the city to get this plate without even going out for the night . . i just go to get this food . its gotten so serious that i don ' t associate myself with people who have never had it and are not willing to try it . . . ask timmy k my cousin , he refused to try it and i didn ' t talk to him for about N months until he finally tried it , and thanked me for showing him the truth . if you ever find yourself on the corner of Nrd and Nth between N pm and N am . . . don ' t let the amount of people in line push you away , it goes by quick and well worth the wait . can you N-N echo for a door opening ? 
based on the thousands of pizzas i ' ve had across the us , this is better than average . i can ' t imagine giving them less than N stars . i had the white clam with half spinach garlic gorgonzola . it was pretty salty . both halves . the fresh tomato pie was similarly overly salty . that ' s all i can fault them for . they were perfectly charred , crispy and delicious . the food quality was very good and we loved the place and service . 
talk about inflexible . i ordered the squash flowers sandwich and asked if they could hold the aioli . the waitress gave me what can only be described as a death stare and informed me that they can not change the contents of the sandwiches under any circumstances , though she could ask for us ( reluctantly - was that fear in her eyes . . . ? ) so , you ' re telling me that this not-inexpensive establishment does not make their sandwiches fresh ? that they ' re all pre-made and are sitting there for goodness knows how long before being served to a customer ? i see . . . after much huffing and puffing she returned to us and said that yes , they could hold the aioli . as a very special favor . i then ( recklessly ! ) wondered if they could get the mozzarella in the sandwich to be melted at all ( not unreasonable ? ? everywhere can do that ! takes less than a minute ! ) and before i ' d even finished the sentence , she was practically exploding . . . " i already got them to hold the aioli , i cannot do any more , are you kidding me , what is this insanity , are you out of your freaking mind ? ! ! " or words to that effect . . . " i take it that ' s a no then ? " inquired i , mildly . she seemed on the verge of a coronary . rather than put her at mortal risk with any further outrage , we opted to leave at that point . my god , what are you guys doing to that poor lady ? ? talk about a high-stress environment ! seriously , i was worried ! ! despite this somewhat hair-raising experience , we did actually return shortly after with another friend ( having eaten somewhere else - half the price and no drama ! ) , just to order a few drinks . they looked tasty ( especially the range of bitters and sodas ! ) . our friend ordered an iced tea . oh no , thought i , as that familiar harassed look spread over the lady ' s face . . . . " no iced tea , we ' re all out ! " " oh , ok , said friend , unfazed . " i ' ll have an iced coffee then . " i don ' t think we have any iced coffee either , though i can check for you . . . " we gave up . black tree , you ' re a joke . and ( judging by the pressure you put your servers under ) not a funny one either . 
sadly , i ' ve only been once . a friend did some cheap work on my house and i took him here , upon his suggestion , for a thank you . wow . first , kip behind the bar is great . second , i love a place i can fine dine sitting at a bar . the interior is very reminiscent of a victorian bar with dark wood , marble . . . lovely . the cocktails were all strong and inventive . served quickly and with care . ask for kip to make you his version of a manhattan . i ordered scallops . divine . i finished with the chocolate creme de pot , which kip said he ' s only ever seen one person finish because it ' s so rich . i took that as a challenge . i finished it . i didn ' t feel very good afterwards but i finished it ! chocolate lovers only there . great place for a date . . . great place for anything ! can ' t wait to go back ! 
i loved this little place ! came here with the significant other at around midnight for a drink and small plates . we ordered from the meze menu , and it was more than enough to keep us satisfied . the hummus and calamari were especially good . i also had the don mclean that was just strong enough , and the apples and cinnamon were a nice touch . the server was really attentive , and the ambience was relaxing and cozy . perfect for a low-key date ! would definitely come here again . 
in the time before gentrification this eatery must have been a sight to see , bustling with local personalities and a sabor uniquely puerto rican . it still gets a crowd and might be a wonderful symbol for the old meeting the new . you ' ll spot old school locals boisterously familiar with the staff , but you won ' t be hard pressed to find adventurous newbies taking in the sounds , smells , sights of an old fashioned eatery - a place where it seems like the waitstaff is involved in the preparation of your food . while very charming , this little eatery is not for the fickle . we waited a while , a long while to get attention from the waitstaff . but it is a tiny neighborhood staple , with its own nuances and we weren ' t prepared for it . once it became apparent that the we weren ' t being served - the staff took extra care to be attentive to us . the food was good . we ate the mofongo - a mashed plantain pork garlic staple of the caribbean . the garlic in the mofongo was very potent . i find mofongo can sometimes be a bit to dry , that was not the case here . the san cocho here was also nice , as good as a restaurants interpretation of the hearty stew can get . the rotisserie chicken was delicious , well seasoned and slow cooked to fatty perfection . the tostones were nice but a bit softer than i prefer . the batida ( a shake of sorts ) was creamy , fruity , and cinammony . had some nice conversations with the staff . smiles all around . 
weekend wait was only about N min . earlyish on saturday ( got there by N Nam ) the monkey french toast , breakfast sandwhich and homemade ketchup were way worth it . the tin coffee mugs are so great and it was fun to sit at the counter and watch the steam-train of chef cook action . N-Npm on saturday and sunday . 
i am from toronto ontario . i been in new york few times and i never forgot to stop by . its the best place to eat . its super cheap less than N ( i wouldn ' t mind paying N for it ) . hot sauce is some thing u don ' t want to miss out on . its spicy and i mean it . 
been coming here for N years i don ' t eat chinese food anywhere else . always fresh and the service is excellent . the drinks are nice too . if you go there try their hot sour soup or their egg drop soup . both are delicious . 
i really don ' t understand how eataly could have anything other than N stars . this is basically a fancy italian heaven . i ' m not suggesting you do your everyday shopping here -- although i used to buy produce here pretty frequently ! but don ' t expect to pay normal prices for pasta sauce . go here when you want to feel fancy , when you want to buy fresh , hours-old mozzarella , and go upstairs to the birreria when you want to enjoy delicious food with better lighting . if you want to eat at the various cafes within the downstairs market i ' ve done it a few times when i want a quick bite , but come on , this is bright grocery store lighting , so it ' s not great for romance . i still appreciate that you can get wine in about N seconds , though . upstairs love the fried mushrooms , the cheese plate , the salads , the prosecco , and the wine on tap . great lighting and cute decor , they have managed to make a huge space more intimate . 
poutine a good effort for all the ingredients , but the gravy was lame--needs a lot more zing . 
i am a regular at hop hing . the staff always remembers me and asks about my family . the food is very yummy , especially the pepper steak . prices are comparable to other local chinese restaurants . i recommend it ! limited seating however . 
really really nice place the food is great and the service is solid they are also very good with the kids the managment is nice when you come in they greed you with a smile and sit you down right away my wife and kids really like this place . 
i didn ' t actually eat here but if you love sangria , this is the place to go . i went here with friends after work one day . three of us split a pitcher of sangria--some of the best i ' ve ever had , and i ' ve had alot ! the best part is it comes with stuffed olives and bread on the side . all that for N ! and each of us had N-N glasses each . why are you still reading this ? go drink sangria ! ! 
love this place . . warm welcoming and good food with interesting choices . . and reasonable prices . . also brunch is wonderful , , especially in the winter with the fireplace working . . they really aim to please here and its not pretentious . . 
wonderful neighborhood bar restaurant . a delicious well crafted menu with really , really great food . their meatballs are sublime . they also are very accommodating to those with kids . went with a friend and her son we sat at the bar and had cosmos and dinner . i hope to head back again . . . 
my favorite brick oven pizza in nyc . my fiancee and i go there whenever we ' re in the mood for pizza . we love the portobello pizza with caramelized onions . absolutely delicious . i wish the tables were a drop bigger , but it still works for a local neighborhood place . really great spot during the summer when the outdoor picnic tables are out . i like their salads too . 
the waiter was annoying as hell . . . just serve the food . . . hate the unfunny chit chat . . . the food was very overpriced . . . i make better pizzas at home for a few bucks
visiting new york last fall we loved bubby ' s and went three times for breakfast . this year it was very mediocre . the bacon that used to be fabulous was so-so . scrambled eggs were under cooked for my liking . it ' s cash only , and when the server brought our change , he shorted us three dollars . he corrected his ' mistake ' and then brought us correct dollar change , but neglected the N cents . seems bubby rounds way up , in their favor . is this legal ? i ' m finding a new breakfast place . 
my go to spot when i ' m craving for chinese food but not sure where to go . been coming here for years ! i regularly get -scallion pancake -pork pan fried dumplings -their rice crepes with peanut sauce -heaven ramen -hot pot rice is crunchy and delicious -iced milk tea they now serve a dessert called infinity ice . i ' ve tried their green tea , strawberry and mango flavors . ( green tea is my fav ) its big enough to share between N-N people and comes with strawberries , jelly and lychee flavored bubble that pops . i personally don ' t like the lychee bubble but the infinity ice is yum in the summer time ! 
my god . this place . i don ' t really know how to elaborate on those first four words . i went here with my girlfriend back in december . it was our first date and i wanted to pretend i was a big shot for the night . this story ' s made better by the fact that she was well aware i was not and am not loaded . ( but i will be . . . ) anyway , the story it ' s pouring rain and we get into the restaurant . the girls behind the counter see me looking like a wet dog since i let my girlfriend have the whole umbrella , and they hand me some towels to dry off with . awesome . but then , even with reservations , there ' s a N minute wait . not so awesome . but it didn ' t matter . first trip to buddakan scores you a free plate of the trademark edamame ravioli . i ' d describe how awesome these bad boys are , but it ' d be like describing a color without just saying the color you can ' t do it . try it . then try to lick your own elbow . i ' ll wait . you done ? okay , moving forward . i ordered the pork shoulder . i have never been this happy with a decision since the time i got orange and black braces on halloween when i was N . so that was destroyed in a matter of minutes . my girlfriend got some chicken tempura thing that looked like sushi but wasn ' t . that description may make it sound like we hated it . we didn ' t . why do i say we ? luckily , i date a girl who doesn ' t finish her entire meal sometimes . so , since i was dropping N on food , i dug into her plate . in other news , the dumplings were out of this world . we finished up with the lemongrass consomme because sometimes i like to feel fancy , okay ! ? go here . just do it . i don ' t care if you have no money , imaginary person . go here and eat . now . 
the best eggs benedict ! ! i have been here a number of times and everytime i bring out of town visitors here , it is a hit ! ! 
refused to accommodate a large group of paying customers hoping to watch some scN . horrible bar , horrible management , never ever go there . 
i ' d like a burrito that originates from an authentic mexican kitchen , not a over-staffed bay area hipster kitchen . while there was nothing wrong with the burrito , there was also nothing remarkable . i passed on the hot sauce , and was left with a very bland burrito . the salsa wasn ' t enough flavor , and they charge an extra buck ( ! ! ) for guac . next time , heading over to chipotle . i don ' t understand why people rave about this place - unless a hipster donning a scooper does it for you . 
wow ! maybe because i came in at an off hour , but why there was not a line down the street , i have no idea because my burger was huge , cooked to medium rare perfection and with cheese was only N . N ( which would be the price of the tip in nyc ! ) . being a yelper who had come to new haven to supervise a model un delegation from the school at which i work , louis ' lunch was on the top of my must try list . i went with an old friend who was here with another delegation . he had already eaten lunch ( it was about N N pm on a friday ) so he had strawberry rhubarb pie that he said was amazing . i had a hamburger without the white bread which is what they serve it on ( they mark the order " atkins . " ) they put onions on the burger but the cheese is served on the side . as others have mentioned , louis ' is a small " take a trip back in history " atmosphere hamburger restaurant that takes its craft very seriously . they use the same cast iron gas vertical cookers in which they have cooked their handmade hamburgers for generations and if like we did , you go at an off hour , the ( Nth generation of the same family ) owner and those with whom he works are down to earth great people with whom to sit and talk ! 
what happened ? ? are they under new ownership or new management ? there is no indication on the burger baby website that they have some kind of reduced menu - what a shock . we went for a small celebration and looked forward to the lobster roll . . . but no lobster . none of the normal burger options either . . . scaled down menu is an understatement . but the prices were not scaled back at all . really overpriced beer and cocktails . it took three trys to get a simple whiskey and ginger ale correct . . . and that is hardly a complicated drink ! ! the food is not the same as it was in the past veggie burger missing avocado fries which used to be nothing short of spectacular were totally overcooked and burgers which were so exceptional in the past were underwhelming . . . half came home for the dog . . . literally ! the staff seems very poorly trained - very nice - but clearly not professional wait staff . i cannot imagine how confused things would have been if there was a single other customer . yes , we were alone when we arrived on a friday night with an event going the next day ( the hartford marathon ) . we love supporting hartford restaurants but we won ' t be back to burger baby . 
i can not stop dreaming about this place ! the meatba s are amazing and thank you for the variety . the only thing that keeps it from N stars is they either need to put one more meatball on or a little bit more sauce ! the deserts are unbelievable ! i love this place ! the bathroom , clean and love the old schoolness of it ! the different take on fusing styles of cuisine for the veggies is new and exciting ! wish they would deliver ! 
very reliable bar in the area . food ' s usually above-average ( then again , i rarely eat there ) . there are enough rooms to keep you entertained ( pool , darts , tv ' s , etc ) . service can be hit-or-miss , so try sitting at the bar or ( gasp ! ) tip well . it ' s surprising how many people " feel out of place " and give it a poor rating . just because ten stone doesn ' t serve N pbr ' s or is a hipster hangout ( somehow " preppy " conformist bad , while american apparel " nonconformist " good ) doesn ' t mean it ' s a terrible place . try the fries and selected appetizers . chicken sandwich is pretty decent . definitely feed some dollars in the jukebox and have a good time . 
this is the place to be ! on a weekend afternoon that is . this place was packed with people at noon and it was clear that the food was superb . had a bloody mary as i waited for my girlfriend and it was spicy and delicious however i don ' t know if it was worth its N . N price tag ( tax included ) . we had the salmon avocado tartare to start and it was very enjoyable . the avocado was mashed into the tartare , something i haven ' t experienced before , but the flavors meshed very well . i had the benedict johnny and it was amazing . the chicken sausage ' s spiciness really balanced out the sweetness of the freshly made cornbread . my friend ' s benedict jane was very good too as i had a bite of that as well . really wanted to try the vanilla bean french toast but will wait to come with a larger group to split it . think it may be too sweet for an overall entree for myself . will come back for brunch lunch again ! 
fantastic restaurant with great value and loads of charm . my girlfriend and i come here often since it ' s right across the street from my apartment , and we are never disappointed . it ' s especially great in the summer when it ' s nice out , since they have plenty of outdoor sidewalk seating . the decor is very homey feeling . good place for a date too , with good lighting and a good enough noise level so it isn ' t too loud to hear , but not too quiet to make it creepy awkward . they have a limited menu , but all the pasta and food is really fresh . the spaghetti alla chitarra is fantastic , really fresh pasta , tomatoes and sauce . the calamari appetizer is great too . they often have differing specials too . don ' t forget it ' s cash only ! 
well , we just loved everything . the very friendly gentleman gave us menus at the counter and asked us to sit down . he came to our table to take our order . we got samosa appetizers , one hot and one cold . both very delicious . kind of in between middle eastern and indian in food and presentation . same with the vegetarian entrees . both amazing eggplant dishes , and both served with piles of flavored rice ( not plain white like indian ) and wonderful naan . . . much better than i ' ve had at indian places . before dinner we were given simple but delicious american style salads , with olives , and two dispensers . . . one with ranch dressing and one with green curry . yum ! they also have a large selection of boring american grill fare so feel free to bring your friends with pre-school palates . lovely chai tea was enjoyed on the cold evening also . we will definitely be back . 
here ' s the skinny . . . excellent view and location . the food was hit or miss at my table of N . my wife and i had excellent food except dessert which was a miss . others at our table for less satisfied . the filet seemed to be a miss which is odd because it ' s hard to screw up meet . my salmon was excellent as we ' re wife ' s soft shell crabs . their choice of sides was not ideal , but that ' s why bread comes in handy . service was better than average . prices were extremely high for what you got in serving size . good for special occasions though . 
if you ' ve ever been through newark penn station on a friday night , you ' ve probably had to swerve to avoid the extremely long lines for this food stand that pretty much just sells freshly-popped popcorn . they do have big plastic containers full of nut mixes and junk , but it ' s the popcorn whose smell wafts through the station and draws a crowd . if you ' re going to see a show at the pac , leave a few minutes early so you can get your corn on ! the popcorn was tops , as far as popcorn is concerned . i ' m not an expert , but i do look for a few things . was it fresh ? oh yes , they ' re making it continuously , so there ' s no time for staleness . was it popped the old-fashioned way ? you bet . the seasoning ? . . . was just salty enough for me , but they have extra available ( though i didn ' t see any fake butter , if that ' s your thing . ) the price ? N . N for movie-theater-small , which is more than enough . and finally , any half-popped ? ? ? yes , i did get a few ! to find it , just follow your nose ! or if that doesn ' t work , try looking right outside the mcdonald ' s in the station . you can also look at the map i drew yelp . com biz jbx vgaNwge 
great food . easy parking . but , yuk location . every meal i ' ve had here has been a good experience . staff is friendly and attentive . 
sripraphai is probably the most authentic thai restaurant in nyc . that doesn ' t say much since the bar is set so low here but they don ' t use bell peppers in every dish and they have an extensive menu and many dishes that represent home-style thai cooking . they are so generous at sripraphai . props to them for even having khao soi on their menu ! we also got the crispy pork with chinese broccoli , pad thai and pork leg with chilli and basil . i see cringing . no . . . they don ' t serve you the entire trotter . it comes as chunks of pulled pork , marinated and cooked in chilli and basil . very tasty , very thai . affordable prices , yummy ( and a lot of ) food . i ' m definitely a fan ! 
i have been here a bunch of times and i really love this place . i will have to say this is a breakfast brunch lunch place only . i really would not ever go here for dinner , but i love breakfast lunch here . my girlfriend always gets the huevos rancheros and they are delicious . i like to try a lot of different things my usual for a while was the meatloaf sandwich and it was amazing , they have since changed it and it is still good but . . . not as good as it was . the specialty coffee drinks that they do are really good as well . i recommend getting there early and try sitting outside in the morning it makes it a little noisy and a little more romantic . i think everyone needs to go there at least once . 
fantastic birthday dinner . love that all the dishes come in half or full portions for tasting . had the best octopus ever as a starter , as well as fresh sea urchin on seaweed and fried quinoa on top . for the main , i had lobster in butter with raspberry coulis , and as a person who never orders lobster , it was worth it ! my wife had veal cheek , and i wish i could ' ve tried it but she loved it . it lives up to the reviews . the service is attentive nice and knowledgeable . a great meal . 
food N . N N ambiance N N service N . N N pricing N N while i can ' t think of too much to say that ' ll differentiate zest from other sushi byos in the city , zest delivers on quick service and good variety . it ' s an odd item to note as being a standout , but the miso soup was really good . the scallions were quite crunchy , and it wasn ' t overly salty . the thai spring rolls are something to skip as an app - very oily . we tried a few rolls that were good , a few that were so-so . the " fiery " and the " samurai " were both quite good . the zen tango and the dark angel ? not so much . dark angel was topped with " seasoned white tuna , " which was a strange temperature . the presentation is pretty , though , and our server was super-quick but not overbearing . i ' d come back again for a casual bite at happy hour , when their rolls are N . 
my girls took me here for a casual baby shower saturday brunch and we all were big fans . i had the bluberry and scrambled egg crepe which was pretty much a glorified french toast with fresh blueberries on top . it was really yummy but i should have asked for the maple syrup on the side b c it was drenched in syrup and super sweet . i would have enjoyed it better if i was able to control how much syrup i got in each bite . in terms of the ambiance , we absolutely loved it . it ' s a super cute spot to dine and has a wonderful relaxed atmosphere . the coffee was also superb from what my friends said ! we definitely plan to come here again ) 
best pizza on the planet . clam pizza ! ! ! waaay better than sally ' s or pepe ' s . 
wowy - no words can describe how amazing these pizzas were , you really need to go try for yourself . we were a party of N - ordered margarita italian sausage , white pizza with wild mushrooms and garlic spinach , and the clam pie . all thin crust , full of flavor but quite different from one another . my favorite was the white pizza , mostly because i love cheese ! atmosphere was cute , quaint , and resembled what i believe to be a typically pizzeria . staff was friendly and accommodating . service was quick . pizzas are a bit pricy - about N-N bucks for a small ( N slices ) but it was worth the price ! 
great food and service . nice atmosphere . 
really intimate and warm ambiance . we had the platanos rellenos as an appetizer . the fish was lukewarm , not hot , but the sauce was really tasty ( also lukewarm ) . i had the baca frita con arroz moro . the dish was great - the meat was very tasty and soft , though i thought the onions on the baca frita were overcooked . we had a side of platanos and they were perfect . their mojitos are incredible . the service is great , with bussers and runners complimenting the attentive service we got from our server . it was a great dining experience . i ' ll be back ! 
amazing food at amazing prices ! just went here with a party of N , and every one of us raved about our meal . small dining room is friendly cozy . i ' m stuffed and my dinner was only N . N ! 
cool brunch spot . make reservations . . . huge line outside . right by the highline . interesting food . . . pretty solid good drinks . 
this is my go-to place whenever i ' m in chinatown . the noodles are tender and perfectly complimented with your meat fish of choice . waiters are always friendly and cheerful . they serve quickly even on busy days . it ' s also a great deal and clean seating . 
one of the best restaurant i went to in new york excellent food . they make you feel like your are home . cockteil are good i had the poquito picante it is great . the desert was good i will be coming back on my next trip to new york with the family
service was great . food seemed a bit healthier than other places but the taste could have been better . 
best cuban i ' ve had in the city
with all the filipinos in the area , it ' s about time i have a place to go to get good home style filipino food that reminds me of my dad ' s cooking . the place is clean , the people are friendly , and the food is fresh . i especially like the pinakbet and the adobo , and the bbq is awesome . she was able to provide me with a tray of pancit in record time and it was a hit at the party . looking forward to my next visit ) 
have been here before and have had great cheese steaks . went today and was given a roll with a slab of meat between it . not chopped and just folded over . when i asked when they stopped chopping the steak , i was told " i don ' t know what he does . he does it different everyday . " i told her i could make this at home with steak-ums . out N . N and will never return . 
food is amazing - period . its breakfast the way you imagine . no matter what day of the week you go , if you ' re going for breakfast you will wait . its a small restaurant and is extremely popular . not sure why there are so many reviews with people complaining about this - especially when your entire party isn ' t present -- be realistic , show up early if you don ' t want to wait - N minutes is average for me and i don ' t usually get there till after N am . i also wouldn ' t show up with more than N people - the place is just too small and from the looks of it , they don ' t have any intention on expanding . 
i love this place . nice service , great food . i " need " the steak tacos at least once a week . everything is super fresh . 
i have to say that we have loved new socials from the first time we ate there never had a bad experience until last night . my husband and i made reservations to celebrate our anniversary when we arrived we were seated promptly but i was hoping because it was our anniversary we would get a nice quiet table but we did not ! we ordered our food and although there was a little bit of a wait we were okay with that . my husband and i both had the ribs with fries . the ribs were cold and overcooked because we kept getting strands of bone marrow in every bite . the ribs were also placed right on top of the fries which we could not eat because they were all soggy . we made mention of this to our waitress ( who was very polite ) and she said she would let them know . she came back and told us she mentioned it to the kitchen staff and they would take it into consideration . she asked us if we were interested in dessert which i was but was not going to pay another dime there because they did not make good on anything not even a dessert on us considering it was our anniversary as well ! one of our favorite appetizers was the crab rangoon dip which they had changed and now put this sweet and sour sauce on top of it which was nasty . what use to be our favorite restaurant is not anymore and will not be going back anytime soon ! 
food benny poached eggs over pork belly , sauteed spinach , biscuit w maple barbecue hollandaise also served with small salad N the eggs were cooked perfectly , but the pork belly was so thin that it was difficult to taste when you ate everything together . the side salad that came with it didn ' t taste that fresh . baked eggs avocado , spinach , roasted tomato , caramelized onions w crostini N overall , this dish was ok . i really liked the roasted tomato and avocado that were baked under the eggs . steak eggs N steak tasted pretty good you choose how you want your eggs corn flake french toast french toasted breaded with corn flakes creating a crunchy exterior , served with peanut butter mousse and grape compote N it comes with N pieces of rectangular shaped french toast , so great to share . imo , this dish would be too heavy for me to finish . judging from eating just one piece , it was pretty good ! the peanut butter definitely went well . crunch on the outside , soft in the inside . we ate it as our dessert ) breakfast pasty N assortment of bite sized pastries all the pastries were hard . highly recommend against it . coffee strong and always refilled ! i don ' t know why but chicken waffles weren ' t on the menu ! waitress super nice , friendly , attentive ) it was pretty crowded on a saturday afternoon . there was still a short wait even with a reservation . i definitely recommend making reservations just to secure a spot . the restrooms are really nice and on your way down , you ' ll pass an underground bar ! i took a peak . it looked cool ! 
delicious food , affordable prices , rumbling location ( subway runs right beneath them ) but the best is the most friendly service you could ever imagine you can get ( without paying for it ) . you need to try them when near penn station . 
delicious pizza . average price N dollars for a personal pizza , big enough for two people . excellent service . 
this place is great . it has the absolutely best prime rib in the whole area ! at one time it was also at an amazing price , and i would treat myself on a regular basis . alas , it has gone up nearly ten dollars . for N . N i expect much more than over salted vegetables , bland salad and soul-less soup . the french fries are fantastic , some of the best i have ever had . i could eat my weight in them , but reserve myself to half portions from this place , always taking enough home for a complete meal , the next day . they really should remove the N hour sign . i cannot tell you how many times i have gone at N N to find the doors locked . wow , no truth in advertising . they once told me that when the students were back , they would go back to N hours , alas tonight as i got off work the only thing on my mind were some wings . no , doors locked , again ! breakfast is standard fare , uninspired and over fried . i swear they fry the pancakes and deep fry the french toast ! you can get a better cup of coffee by soaking dirty socks in hot water . it amazes me , that something so simple can taste so horrible . if this place had decent coffee , free wifi and was open N hours as advertised , hungry college kids would pack the joint for late night studying . 
great food . do not ever order in . first off , the food is really tasty . the shawafal is great and i recommend trying their pizza with the shawarma . very nice twist to the usual pizza toppings . ask for some gravy from the chicken kabab for the rice bowl ! i ' ve eaten at the restaurant a lot , as well as picked up food . as great as the food and service is at the restaurant , these guys are terrible at making deliveries . i live in downtown new haven . they are a street away , but once the food took N . N hours from the time i placed the order to get to me . i thought it was a bad day , so i tried again after a couple of weeks . this time the food got to me N hours after i placed the order by phone , including N follow up calls to the restaurant . the first time they said the order had just left . N min later i called again and was told that he ' s stuck in traffic and it would take another N min to reach me . then we called them to say we didn ' t want the food and ate elsewhere . as we were finishing our lunch elsewhere , the delivery guy called to say he was at the apartment with my food . we asked him to take it back . again . i live one street away . great food , but just go there or pick it up ! don ' t wait for them to deliver it to you . 
my husband and i treated family to dinner last night at casa giuseppe . we have been coming there for years . the food , service and atmosphere are second to none . my husband had the fish special that was prepared perfectly . i chose a favorite of lobster ravioli . it was as delicious as i remembered . you won ' t be disappointed . 
this restaurant has exceptional service , doesn ' t get any better ! the food is exquisite too ! 
i come here for the atmosphere more than the food , especially given the slightly higher than average price . i usually come for sunday brunch . i ' ve had the white omelette , the meatball sliders , and the whole wheat pancakes . all lovely , but probably not knock-my-socks-off good . but i do so enjoy their cute and simple interior , the guest book to sign after the check , and the lovely music selection . it ' s a great versatile place to take anyone for a pleasant dining experience . 
the ambiance is beautiful , the inside of the restaurant just gorgeous . they have a large water fountain in theN middle that is just cool to watch . but now for the important stuff the food and the staff . the food was good to great , not disappointed . the crab sheets ( crab rangoon in many places ) was a little over cooked but still very good , the dough outside was a bit burnt . i also had the tom yum seafood and ordered it on the higher end of spicy , at first i thought the soup was pretty bland , i like my eyes to sweat when i eat , until i was about half done . i then realized that the spices was in the bottom of the soup and it need to be mixed . once mixed the soup was well spiced and tasty , wish i would have stirred it form the begging . well on to the meal , i had the plumb duck and the wife had pad thai , she always orders that . she found the pad thai to be average but to her average is good . the duck was great and the plumb sauce very tasty both i and the wife agreed . this was the best duck i have perhaps ever had and mixing it with the sauce and a piece of the cooked plumb great . the only problem i had with it was i was not very hungry , because of all the appetizers , and still ate it all , yes it was that good . for desert the wife had the mango sticky rice and found it great , much better then average . i also had a class of thai iced tea and that was very good . the staff was attentive and nice and took care of us well . overall probably the best thai food in the area and we will be going there again . 
andros diner in newark has the best food . the best people . the best staff and it feels like home . it is open N hours and i gotta say that everyone is so nice and funny that you wonder how all these people are happy N hours a day ! lol the people are really awesome and if you cant eat-in , andros diner delivers ! and they have pizza . . its just all around the perfect place to go and eat and chill . 
passed by here for the second time tonight and decided to stop by because it looked intriguing . well , i was directed around the corner to their retail window , and there was quite the little line that had formed ! i guess scratchbread is getting its name out there . i only got the pizza bread , which was amazing ! ! extremely flavorful and filling . i saw that they had a chai sticky bun , which i have to go back and try . i ' m very excited that this place is a short walk away from my apartment , and even more excited that it ' s down the block from the ymca . i can get a fattening baked good and then hop on down the block to work it off ! in an ideal world that is what would happen , but i know with such a great place nearby i will be popping in far more often than i will be using the gym x oops . . 
a nice new edition on the corner of pleasant valley way and eagle rock avenue . this storefront has been a lot of things in recent years . from the look of the crowds every time i drive by , i think this one is here to stay . overall , the turkish food is very good . i thought the menu was pretty large and interesting . decent shepherd salad with or without feta cheese and nice smokey baba ghannoush served with very good bread . i thought the mantis had very little flavor . for entrees , we had both doner and kofte . i thought the kofte was excellent , with a nice grilled flavor and a decent amount of spice . the doner was served with tomato sauce and yoghurt which masked the flavor of the meat . the meat did have a nice flavor . my biggest problem is that the service was pretty indifferent . perhaps they were overwhelmed on a saturday night , but they didn ' t say anything to us while we waited for a table for N-N minutes , got one of our entrees wrong etc . appetizers came out quickly , but we had a pretty decent wait for our main courses . this is a little surprising given the nature of the food . the doner is always cooking on a spit and the kofte is a simple grilled patty . if the service picked up , they would get another star . i would give it another shot on a quieter night . 
enchiladas verdes and watermelon juice . can ' t think of a better meal to start the day off right . 
if you are human , you will recognize it as some of the best pizza in the state ( and by extension the world ) . when i tasted this pizza , it literally brought tears to my eyes , because it was so good and reminiscent of old world pizza in princeton before they shut . i have tried in vain for two years to find a tomato pie that was even close to old world , but i think this might have it beaten . this newly opened pizzeria is an undiscovered jewel . if this place were zagat rated , i would be surprised if it didn ' t receive at least N N . i think i will go back tomorrow and have some more . yes , it is that good . 
i ' ve eaten here about N times over the last couple of years . i love the casual vibe and the service has always been great . food is reliable , although the menu is somewhat limited and is very heavy . wish they had some lighter fair . also very inflexible in terms of the menu ( can i have a sale on the side - i will pay extra no ) . shines brightest on sundays with its sunday fried chicken dinner which is sensational ( N a person ) i prefer the bar area to the restaurant bit in the back . i think this is slightly pricey compared to other places , but not too bad . 
i cant say enough great things about tenstone . i ' ve been a customer since day one . tenners easily has the best beer selection around . marvin always picks the best flavors . i cant count how many times the bartenders have got me drunk . tenstone is thee definition of local corner bar . there are plenty of trendy places around to have a craft beer , no one treats you like the staff at tenstone . in addition , tenstone is not a gourmet gastropub , its a corner bar . treat it as such . the menu . . . fantastic , burger , wings , filet cheese steak , fantastic . dont come through expecting dill on your eggs or some bullshit french twist on the burger , sack up , drink like a man , shoot pool , play darts , or take your pansy suburban overly analytical palet to village whiskey they ' ll be happy to stroke you off . 
you could walk by brancaccio ' s one hundred times and never really notice it . from the exterior , it is the very definition of nondescript and you ' d certainly never expect to walk into this place and be treated to such quality food . brancaccio ' s isn ' t the type of joint where you ' ll find food that is on the cutting edge of cuisine . what brancaccio ' s does is great sandwiches using high quality ingredients and superb preparation . look , it ' s high time we admit that it ' s just hard to improve on the simple sandwich . adding some rare himalayan green that is in season for N hours every year does not make a better sandwich . just do what these guys do and use high quality ingredients prepared with care and attention . as to the service , it was fine when i was there . i don ' t think the owner was in , but the guys behind the counter were sufficiently attentive that i was able to place my order and get out in a completely reasonable amount of time . this spot is definitely one of those yelp gems . completely unexpected and absolutely worth the trip . 
one of the best restaurants in the city , in my opinion . the appetizers are light and flavorful , desserts are fresh , complex , and just sweet enough , and the main courses are well-crafted and creative . if they have the iman bayaldi pasta as a special , be sure to order it you won ' t be disappointed . 
i first dined at kefi for a last minute celebration last year and was pleasantly surprised . the restaurant is huge and has great foood . i had the sheep milk ravioli and boy it was delish . beware though because it ' s pretty heavy . although the portion looked small , i was stuffed by the end . my bf had the lamb shank which he thought was pretty good . kefi is perfect for all occasions and the patrons varied from families to couples to a group of older women . they have great options for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike . the service was impeccable and the food was great . i highly recommend kefi for any occasion ! 
folks in the know had been encouraging me to stop by this place , and i ' m glad i finally made my way in . on first glance , the aesthetic was clever and unobtrusive ( velvet paintings , hanging scuba-dude , etc . ) , the music was heavy but not overbearing , and the crowd looked like the kind of people you wouldn ' t want to cross - unless you were crossing arms for a arm-linked-stein-chug . there were several good beers on tap with a definite eye to mixing up heavy light beers , wine on tap , and canned and bottled beer from pbr to world-class craft brews . i didn ' t get into the liquor that night , but i spied some good looking rye whiskey and buho mezcal on the shelf , which is all i really care about anyway . cocktail list was enticing , including michelada ancho chile mezcal for N ( fuck ya ) , and the food menu was concise but solid , with mexican faves and a burger , which was mostly why i was there . all of this qualifies the place as five-star in my book , but the staff really made the place . my girlfriend and i each ordered a burger and fries we ordered separately but only received one number , and when the runner brought out my food less than ten minute later , he took it with him . we thought that might be a problem , and sure enough , we waited for a good N minutes after my food arrived before we decided to mention it to the bartender . in too many places in new york , the bartender would get huffy about this situation , get defensive , cop an attitude , etc . - unless you ' re a regular , and this was the first time i ' d been to the place . this guy , however , listened to what happened and told the kitchen and actually apologized , sincerely even . this was great , all i could have hoped would happen . even better , the cook runner came out and apologized for the miscommunication - i insisted it was no problem , i understood , thanks loads . five minutes later my lady ' s food came out ( the burger is off the hook , btw . with a double patty and cheese melted into grilled onions , crispy fries ) and i went to grab another beer . the bartender said , " six bucks " and grabbed the ten i had set on the bar , but then turned back and said , " oh , actually its on me , for the whole burger thing , " and a little later , he did the same thing for my girlfriend . are you kidding me ? best bartender i ' ve met to date ( and i ' m a bartender - this guy makes me look like crap ) . point being , the place is cool , the booze is abundant and varied , the food is better than you ' d hoped , and the staff is fucking awesome . places like this are why i don ' t leave bushwick anymore . 
ok , i expected a philly cheesesteak in philadelphia to be awesome but it wasn ' t . this was just good , but nothing spectacular . not as cheesy as i ' ve tried before . i wanted more gooey cheese goodness . also not as salty as i expected which is both good and bad . if this is real philadelphia style cheesesteaks then they ' re a lot more healthy but less awesome tasting that i had thought . the roast pork sandwich was also good here but also not as tasty as i was expecting . its good but since there ' s so many of these places in philadelphia , next time i ' m back in philly , i ' d probably try someplace else to see how a different place would make it . 
kinda upscale for ramen , but it just tastes sooo authentic . had the akamaru . comparable to ramen i ' ve had in japan . also , waitstaff speaks japanese and greets you loudly with an " irasshaimase " . . . which is somewhat more comforting than a lot of other japanese restaurants which only serves japanese food . long wait , but they ' re more than happy to serve you at the bar as you are waiting . 
i used to go there to hit on single moms who would bring their kids there while they would sit and relax . ' jeff is s very remarkable person . rose is dumber than a sack of hammers . but they attract a business because at the end of the day , they know their craft . the bagels are good . i can deal with the lame high school students who don ' t know a damn thing about anything and their stupid conversations for N minutes so i can get my bagel . the fresh squeezed oj is also amazing , even though sometimes i do feel like whipping a bottle of it at someones head . anyway . . . bagels , good things . 
love it love it weekday brunch until N pm outdoor seating and happy hours drinks are N only the food is delicious and have the baked eggs and french toast
ambiance is nice . only issue is that no one was in the place and its friday ! ! ! ! 
the pizza is okay if they could leave out the salt . we find it very greasy also . prices are a bit high for what you are getting . some tines the service is slow . it is okay because it is local . 
sitar is terrific ! we go frequently for the lunch buffet , especially on weekends . the food is delicious and the staff is wonderful , especially ashwin . at weekend brunches there are exceptionally good south indian specialties . there is always a good assortment of vegetarian options . the combination of tasty , healthy food along with a friendly , comfortable ambience has kept us coming regularly for years . 
hands down , the best breakfast i ' ve ever had . this place is reasonably priced and everyone who works there smiles at you . it ' s a little disarming . . . they seem genuinely happy . they give you free coffee while you wait in line and feed you with lots of scrumptious bits . i am now trying to move to prospect heights just so i can go to tom ' s and beast more often . now if that isn ' t love , i don ' t know what is . 
my husband and i have been going to marzullo ' s for about N years now and we love it . they always have the best food and they are consistently good . they never have an " off " day . we even go there since we ' ve moved farther away since it is worth the extra ride just to know you are going to get the best food . the wait staff and owner are friendly and personable . the experience is always great . thanks marzullo ' s ! 
so good . perfectly cooked brisket . love the set up and how simplified the business model is . you got in , get what you want ( bbq meat ! ) beer , no wait staff and enjoy ! 
karaka-men ramen was the perfect amount of spice and so delicious ! ! service was also very welcoming ! 
i stopped in to get a bagel sandwich as a treat for my husband and i to share for lunch . this was no treat ! the cajun chicken sandwich , one of their special sandwiches , consisted of a frozen , breaded chicken patty , microwaved , and then put on a bagel with some really odd sauce . i wouldn ' t even let my dog finish what i was throwing out . will not be back . 
the lunch specials are pretty cheap considering the amount of food they serve . but only thing is you have to eat in otherwise a la carte , so we decided to stay . only about N options for the main entrees , i had the calamari with chili basil . comes with soup salad a drink . they had about N N options for each appetizer drinks . pretty impressive . i had the spicy papaya salad tom yum ( shrimp ) soup . food is verry veryy spicy and very very good . they serve a whole lotta rice . the entree portion is smaller but it didnt seem to matter . there was just soo much food i couldnt finish had to get the rest packed . N for sticky rice mango . it ' s pre-packaged comes with a whole peeled pre-sliced mango sweet milk you add yourself some crunchy stuff to put on top after you heat the rice . it wasn ' t sinfully good ( as in house prob . ) , but damn near close . snorted the whole thing . - minus one star only because jaiya still tops every thai place fer soup -- hands down ! fyi they only take cash are closed on wednesdays ! ( weird ) note very very fast service extremely nice staff pretty packed on a weekday afternoon ! crazyy ! definitely worth the trek . . . caution spicy means hot till your skin melts off very spicy you might as well gather your belongings write yr will because you won ' t come out alive . heh heh . . . . overall analysis me likeeey me indian me come gain pho sho
very good . . . but the olive oil dessert they have is not the same " hidden menu " item at babbo . what a disappointment ! at least the rest of my meal was good . 
six of us met at the red cat for an early dinner before a concert at msg . we started off at the bar while waiting for our the last two to arrive and i tried the beer barrel bourbon . excellent cocktail and bar staff . they offered a generous sample to try-before-you-buy and i found it exactly what i was looking for . the have a nice wine list and offer many by-the-glass . our party was complete and the wait staff offered to carry our drinks and escort us to our table . i tried the lamb shoulder and it was perfectly prepared and presented . others had the pork chop and the tile fish . everyone had a very nice meal . staff was very responsive and cleared our plates as we completed our entrees . i highly recommend trying the red cat if your looking for a good meal , exceptional attention and an excellent value . 
the food should get N stars but the service do not deserve N star and if you get a rude server please do not complaint to the manager because she he will treat even worse a place to avoid if you don ' t mind the abuse
the good was tasty , wine list decent for the size of the restaurant . the service ? awful . first of all , my husband and i were seated in the worst section . i don ' t mean location-wise , i mean staff-wise . our server ( if you go , she has long fake blonde hair and looks scary skinny , almost like the crypt keeper ) was the rudest , most inconsiderate and short-tempered woman i ' ve ever met that works in the service industry . she rolled her eyes at my husband ' s questions ( as she turned her back to walk away , so i think she thinks we didn ' t see her ) , didn ' t smile once , and acted like we were idiots the entire time she spoke to us . at one point , i heard her talking badly about another server ! i understand the restaurant industry is probably very frustrating , but i don ' t want to hear about your problems , i want to enjoy my meal . another server , who wasn ' t ours and didn ' t deal directly with us , was very immature . i think she may play a more vital role in the restaurant than just as a waitress , because many other customers seemed to recognize her and talk to her . the problem was she came across as very juvenile . . . she would constantly giggle behind her hand to the bartender or hostess , and acted like she always had some hilarious secret to tell . i understand she ' s young and likes to have fun , but there ' s a time and place to act like it , and working in a restaurant is not that time or place . her actions made me feel like i was back in middle school being judged by the cool kids . also , she played with her hair a lot . it seemed it was always in a different style every time i saw her . . . that cannot be sanitary . if my husband and i choose to eat here again , it will probably be delivery . we don ' t want to deal with the awful staff again . 
i went to brooklyn commune with a friend for brunch , service was really lacking . we first sat at the window and no one came for about N minutes . a table opened up so we sat down and were served . we waited with empty plates and glasses for almost N minutes before we got up and settled at the counter . we were never offered water or a refill the entire time . my friend got the cheese grits which she liked but personally i didn ' t enjoy . i found it strangely seasoned though i ' m partial to only salt in mine . she also got a side of bacon which was fine . i got a ham brie croissant which was underwhelming . it was slightly warm but not really and had a side salad thrown in it . the croissant was just kind of bleh , something i would expect from a cheap street cart . 
ok . my wife and i have been here twice . excellent both times . we just keeping talking about the food and going back . love the lamb and the hummus ! the falafel is excellent ! it is a tiny place with about N seats so the chef owner does it all . we have had everything on the menu and all was great or better . stop reading this review and go if you like middle eastern food . 
fantastic pizza ( try a pie with sausage , meatball and ricotta ) and amazing service i live on Nst street and the pizza gets delivered in N-N minutes ! in my opinion , one of the best pizzerias in nyc . 
went for brunch . my boyfriend and i are sooooooooo happy . the bartender was fabulous . she was playing some great tunes . so the low down for brunch . . . N unlimited bloody and mimosas . and the bloody mix was amazing and homemade . brunch ranges from all sorts of goodies but they are so flexible . we did the tasting menu for N and the house cured salmon with dill hollandaise . yum ! ! ! ! our favorites were the french toast and the salmon . we got there around Npm . . . so at Npm turned happy hour . yes ! ! ! choices are for N are house wine ( which is really good ) , draft , well , and daily cocktail . so full stomachs , good tunes , cocktails . this is what i call a fab saturday . buy the yelp deal too ! they were happy that it brought us in for our first time . and tuesday nights , they do half off bottles of wine . super staff , food and vibe . what a gem . 
awesome brunch in the west village . love the egg benedict with short rib hash . . . . 
i rarely spend N for an entree , but this was well worth it . i hadn ' t ordered pork from a menu in N years , but could not resist the pork chop on a mound of creamy polenta . the meal more than lived up to expectations with wilted bok choy and soft pear in a hearty jus . the chop was exquisitely cooked - thick , evenly cooked and charred on both sides . we also got the farro risotto which i wouldn ' t have named as such but offered delicious aroma of cream , stock and herbs . the vegetarian tart was hearty with a perfect crust . maybe not the most exciting thing on the menu , but unique . service was fantastic , with one small exception- we tried to get drinks at the bar prior to our reservation . even after finally sitting in front of the bartender , it took him N minutes to acknowledge us . hire backup- poor guy was also providing cocktails for the whole dining room . finally , the the complimentary dark chocolate cookie with salted toffee was the perfect bite to end a perfectly executed meal ! thanks perilla . 
bohemian is one of my favourite restaurants in new york . the concept , the atmosphere , the food- everything my taste . the fact that not too many people know about it ( yet , and hopefully remains that way ) . we didn ' t order the tasting menu as we wanted to pick our own dishes . everything there was so yummy- especially the japanese steak , and it comes with sweet potatoes ( my favourite ! ) . another favourite was the uni croquettes . apart from the food , they also have amazing cocktails , really enjoyable dinner as always . 
gourmet hot dogs with a variety of creative toppings and an awesome selection of dipping sauces . craft sodas . fresh hand cut fries
excellence ! food here makes me wanna comeback ! yeah service can be better but i don ' t go there for service i just leave a bad tip . 
if this place was called something innocuous , like joe ' s deli , i might be able to give this place a higher rating . instead , they call it " gourmet heaven " , and give every appearance at first of being a high-end ye olde foode shoppe . when you actually try the food , it ' s both too expensive , and below par . hard to accomplish , but they manage it . even packaged things like sushi can look okay , but when you taste it you ' ll regret paying a N premium . entire sections of the store have no price tags . unless you have the conviction to walk out when you find out the price , don ' t even bother going in there . 
i am a regular very clean . very nice people . best coffee in ct , they developed their own blend . best pancakes , potato pancakes , eggs benedict , home fries , corned beef hash , barbecue sandwiches , burgers . not a big fan of huevos rancheros or the chili though the owner mentioned making fresh chili rather than using a supplier in the near future . try the beet soup or other polish dishes , who knew beet soup could be so good ? one of my favorite things on the menu . the dining experience is pleasant , better than at any other breakfast and lunch spot i know of in ct . 
i came here for dinner and the food was great . we really enjoy the food and the waiter service was great . we were here about N pm , and it got pack in half hour . and this was a monday night . recommend make reservations for more than people . 
boy oh boy ! ! ! if you haven ' t had the opportunity to feast on one of these delicious dogs . . . . then you surely are missing out ! and let ' s not even mention the yummy fries and the out of this world dipping sauces . . . . i am forever a fan of underdogs . . . i ordered the marrakesh and had the curry mayo dipping sauce with my fries , and i had no complaints at all . i can ' t wait for my next dog ! if you like hot dogs or sausages . . . . hurry . . . . i said hurry ! ! ! and get on down to underdogs to satisfy your lunch craving you won ' t be disappointed . 
i would have recommended this restaurant a year ago but my experience this week was a total nighmare . the staff was unfriendly to the point of being rude when we asked to see a waitress after sitting for N minutes with no one else in the restaurant . the food was a total disappointment . it started out with the bread being left in the oven too long and had a rancid taste . i ordered the pork chops wrapped in prosciutto and the meat was dry and tasteless . my son lucked out with the fish as it was tasty and of good quality . my husband had the worse experience as he ordered the paella and was brought a bowl of " casuelas de mariscos " which is seafood in a clear broth with a scoop of black rice in the center . we mentioned to the waitress that this was not paella and her response was " if the waiter calls it paella then i have to believe that ' s what it is ! " needless to say we didn ' t stick around for dessert and will never return . 
great for studying but seating fills up quickly , especially during finals . free wifi ! avoid the pastries
stopped in to tunxis grill tonight and i must say i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food . started our meal with the fried sprouts all i can say is amazing the sauce was just as good as the sprouts , after that i had the shrimp special it had sun dried tomatoes and spinach in a garlic sauce and i ate the entire dish wanted to lick the plate . my wife had the jambalaya and said was best she ever had service was excellent for a new restaurant i thought we would have to wait forever for our food but everything seemed to come out in the perfect amount of time they really have things together there
i went there lastnight . i have been there about N or N times before . had good service food was N N . we had a party of N N meals were good N were so so . i had prime rib , it was a little tough , delmonico was good . my nephew had talapia and was good . noisy . i would recomend but stick to the basics . 
hands down one of the best filipino restaurants i have been to . it beats ihawan , kuma inn and crystal ' s . romantic ambience , delicious food and cocktails that leave you wanting more ! loved the sisik , lumpia , kare-kare , crispy pata , lechon kawali , and lamb adobo . 
one of the best tapas places that i ' ve been to by far . there were some problems with our table being very wobbly - to the point that glasses could easily slid off and shattered on the floor . i ' m surprised that a restaurant of this caliber allowed this table to remain on the floor . they put some wedge pieces to alleviate some of the wobbliness - but it didn ' t help much . i spent much of the evening leaning on one corner of the table to prevent the table from shifting . very annoying . our server really made a good effort to correct it , but alas , they should just get a permanent fix in the future . ambiance is very cozy . would make a nice date spot . as for the food , the razor clams are probably one of the most popular dishes . if you like razor clams , i highly recommend that you give it a try . with a bit of char flavor , cooked to perfect tenderness , it was one of the best dishes ordered . the skirt steak was also excellent . for skirt steak , it was tender and easy to cut . flavors were subtle with caramelized onions on top that you could portion out to suit your preference . i also enjoyed the sweet bread . the fluke crudo was ok - if you like sashimi it ' s not a bad option , but i felt that the cucumber salsa distracted from the flavor of the fish . would probably try something else next time . they recommend N-N dishes per person . we were satisfied with N dishes . the portions are not large , but they are sufficient . prices were about N per dish , which was reasonable given the level of this restaurant . if you want to treat you significant other to something nice , make a reservation here . you will likely not regret it - unless you table wobbles and glasses slide off the table and shatter , cutting your legs . 
N N N stars we decided this trip that trattoria trecolori would be our italian restaurant . since good italian food is hard to find in the dc metro area , we always make it a point to have some when we ' re in the northeast . after having heard good things about this place , we went there on a monday night around N p . m . we chose monday night since theaters tend to be dark on that day so we figured that it wouldn ' t be very crowded---and we were right . we were seated immediately and our server showed up promptly . after perusing the menu , we decided that for our appetizer , we would have caprese with prosciutto . there was a N extra charge for the prosciutto---we didn ' t mind that . the mozzarella slices were thick , the tomato slices , also thick , were a bit underripe and the prosciutto was on the stringy side . you add your own balsamic vinegar and olive oil and there are bottles on each table . i ended up putting too much vinegar on it as it flowed out of the bottle suprisingly quickly . however , i rectified this ( sort of ! ) by adding too much olive oil . my husband had a bowl of pasta e fagioli soup which he thought was on the bland side . it did , however , have a lot of stock in it . for main courses , i got rigatoni alla trecolori and my husband got penne arrabiata . the rigatoni was indeed three colored ( red , white and green ) . the red being sun-dried tomatoes , the green being broccoli rabe and the white being pasta . it also had sliced sweet italian sausage in it . i thought it went overboard on the sausage and the olive oil based sauce was bland . the excessive sausage portion made for an extremely filling dish . my husband thought that there were way too many green peppers in his dish which he found a bit off-putting . however , the saving grace was that the arrabiata sauce did have some kick . all in all , a decent meal . not the best italian meal we had in nyc to be sure but still we have no regrets for having tried it . 
i went to sabor peru today with high hopes . there aren ' t many latin food restaurants in the area and i always wanted to try this place . i don ' t review restaurants regularly but i had to after going there . i ' m ecuadorean and my husband is italian . we love food and are familiar with the peruvian cuisine . the staff was friendly welcoming and helpful , but the food took quite a while to come out considering the fact that we ordered two specials only one a la carte dish and we were the only customers there . while the menu items are very creative and sounded great , the food was very obviously not fresh at all . which made me wonder again why it took so long . the seafood special was overpriced at N which we didn ' t know until we got the bill . it was the red snapper which my husband described it as dry as a piece of cardboard . my husband ' s biggest pet peeve is paying for food that is not worth the price . he doesn ' t mind paying a high price for high quality . for the kind of money we spent here , i would ' ve much rather gotten dressed up and went to my favorite fancy restaurant . don ' t waste your money it was a bad experience . we won ' t be coming back here . my husband ' s tip . . . if there aren ' t any customers there , don ' t bother going inside ! better off going to mcdonald ' s ! 
i ordered for the birthday party and all preparations were amazing , highly recommended for party orders ! ! ! 
dear god yes ! can we say ginormo portions that don ' t make any sense ! my friend and i went for brunch and split her french toast with cream and my juevos rancheros special . the perfect sweet and savory combo . there was so much food i was glad her apartment was a solid N minutes away walking because i needed to burn some of that off . the waiter seemed pretty proud of how we handled our plates , but even he said finishing their meals is probably not the best thing . the food was really good too , and i was grateful . i hate over-sized plates of crap . it ' s pretty tight seating but there is a front room , back room , and small patio . if you are going during philly ' s infinite cold months get there close to open to snag a place inside . besides that enjoy the food and coffee . 
one of my favorite places in the village for brunch , located on a charming block . the french toast in particular is crazy good , and has to be tasted to be believed . it can be a bit challenging to get a table on sundays , but the rest of the week isn ' t too bad . the tables do tend to be quite close together , which can be an issue when the place is full . 
i visited here for the first time this evening . i have no complaints about the food , the service or the ambience . the rub was the price of cocktails . N for a martini is just outrageous . similarliy , i ordered a grand marnier after dinner which was also N . ( less than a shot , i swear ! ) i called the manager over to express my displeasure and he gave me N gift card and assured me that the prices would be adjusted the next time i visited . i ' ll give them another try , but i have to say if they continue with nyc prices on bloomfield ave . , they won ' t last long . too bad . verona could use a restaurant of this type . 
my boyfriend and i ate here last night . it was awesome . the area is really nice , and calm . we had the degustation menu which was perfect . amazing fusion tuna w rice crackers , wines were perfect match with the food . the service is also very good , our waitress was really professionnal and attentive . we had a great time here ! would highly recommend ! 
really enjoyed this place . all buckwheat flour crepes and a few other choices . you pick the ingredients . i had one with egg whites , roasted leeks and wild mushrooms . had a pesto like sauce on the side . it was fantastic . the girls split one with chicken and sauteed vegetables . a bit too wet ( crepe got soggy ) but very tasty . then they had a dessert crepe with mixed berries and a caramel sauce . pretty nice . nice french bistro with large windows and the sun the shining . a nice place for brunch . 
never disappoints ! ! ! this place is always great . . by far danny meyers best restaurant ! doesn ' t matter if your eating at the tavern or in the dinning room the food is always amazing ! ! ! ! don ' t miss this place if you in the city - its a must ! ! ! 
solid west village spot with an assortment of food and wine at a reasonable price . shared the pasta , pizza , and burger . pasta was better than the pizza , which was better than the burger . this won ' t be the best pasta or pizza you ever had , but it ' s a great value for the quality and there were plenty of tables available when we rolled in on a friday night . will come back if in the neighborhood without reservations . 
i used to frequent this restaurant until they began employing rude obnoxious servers . these days they push you to order quickly , push you to eat quickly , then push a bill in front of your face before you ' re even half way through your meal . what was once a nice place to dine in the village is now about as nice as mcdonald ' s . 
i have been here many times , and my most recent trip was last saturday with my wife and parents . i usually have a dinner crepe with chicken , broccoli , and cheddar , which is always excellent . this time , i decided to go for a dessert crepe and got mixed berries , nutella , and hazelnut ice cream . it was absolutely heavenly . the escargot was great as usual as was the bottle of sauvignon blanc that i split with my mother and wife . overall , if you like crepes , i would highly recommend this place over and over again . great atmosphere , great service , excellent food , and the prices won ' t break the bank ! 
i tried the harissa falafel sandwich from taim . each falafel ball is extremely moist , well seasoned , and has that much needed crunch . the israeli salad within is really good compared to other places where they throw in a few limp pieces of lettuce and tomato . at N . N , this sandwich may be a little pricey . fortunately , the quality makes up for it . do get the ginger mint lemonade . at N , it makes for a refreshing thirst quencher . 
this is one of my staple places to go in philly . i bring my friends and family there whenever someone out of town comes to visit or whenever i get a chance to go out . they have a great owner and some great people on their staff . it is a unique place with unique food drinks . it ' s a one of a kind burger joint with adventurous options . it is also one of my favorite things about philadelphia . 
o verdadeiro italiano em manhattan . por es generosas , atendimento gentil e eficiente . o sabor da massa maravilhoso ! esse lugar a perfeita defini o de " custo-benef cio , em um ambiente extremamente agrad vel . 
stopped by numerous times for lunch while working in the area . the staff was always friendly and the pizza was pretty tasty . during the uefa tournament , they ' d have a huge projector playing the games at lunchtime . mmm , i kinda miss this place , it ' s been a long time . 
have been going to the is restaurant for years . it has totally gone down hill . what you see is what you get as far as food , ambience , staff and location . the food was just average and way over priced . the ambience has not changed in over N years that i have been going there . well the staff is much like the neighborhood , inner city and low class . will do just about anything for a tip . 
been her during summer of N ' , best dang pizza ive never had
even though i ' ve been gifted with living near by , i can say they place is worth ever mile traveled for their square . nothing compares . you can taste quality in every bite . their traditional " round " is decent nothing to brag about . the restaurant side is your typical family style italian restaurant . i ' d compare it to don pepes . i would also try ther spiking icec cream . doesn ' t matter if it ' s the winter or summer , always delicious . 
i ' m now a flight attendant but mainly live in newark . . newark has awesome food but it can get boring cuz it ' s all spanish portuguese food ! this diner has always been my " to go " place for food . . breakfast , lunch , dinner and even late night ! love me the spanish skillet omelet with cheese and sweet potato fries ! great food and down to earth folks ! 
tom and i had N small pizza ' s so we could each have what we wanted . i really preferred the white pizza i had ( sp . magarita ) . i also picked up a greek salad and a pizza on another visit . the salad they put together in front of me instead of some pre-packaged yuck . the hours are kind of kooky as they are closed for a time between lunch and dinner , but the owners are very nice and we ' ll be back . 
based on the high reviews of this deli , i thought i would go check it out and get some of that prosciutto de parma as a nice snack with cheese and dom ' s hoboken baguette i had purchase at the farmer ' s market . with everything i had being of great quality , the one that totally ruined my taste bud was the hideous looking of the prosciutto i purchased from michael ' s salumeria . it was dark looking , thick , and salty even though i was told this was cut paper thin . really ? ? and you call yourself a " salumeria " i had my share of great italian salumeria with one my favorite being " salumeria rosi " in new york . i wouldn ' t compare the two but if you can even provide decent looking and paper thin prosciutto then you are not worth the name " salumeria " . sorry , but i really tried to like this one since it is much closer to me but it was a very disappointing experience . 
i ' ve been here several times and always order the crispy grits . they ' re delicious . the shrimp po boy is good too . the service was slow the first two times i went but it was much better this time . all in all , it ' s great to see places like this in my neighborhood . 
montowese food center is simply the best homemade food for breakfast lunch as many choices lunch specials everyday subs are jamed packed and nice priced ! plus great quick custmer service very fast and back to work on time in and out with the great cashier debbie shay and see charlie for your custom cut of meat and the freshest ground beef and if you dont see what you need charlie will see you have just what you need ! more than a great place to shop they treat you like family ! ! ! simply the best ! ! ! hats off to the entire staff ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i ' ve spent the better part of two years being extremely envious of my friends ' brunch dates at calle ocho . . . i finally make a reservation and it ends up being one of the worst meals i ' ve had in new york city . friends and i arrived at Npm and were seated immediately--service started out very friendly and attentive . we got our bread basket quickly , a great variety of warm rolls with a berry flavored butter which ended up being the highlight of my experience . we ordered a selection of sangrias , most of which were quite tasty , then it was all downhill from there . i ordered the shrimp and bacon grits dish that came with two poached eggs drenched in an oily chipotle hollandaise sauce . this by far was one of the most off-putting dishes i ' ve ever consumed a single bite of . if you read through any of my previous reviews you ' d learn that i ' ve never once left my food unloved but this was a special situation . the aroma coming off the plate was something like weird , spicy hot dogs . the shrimp and bacon seemed of a mediocre quality and the flavor of the dish was very obscure and really spicy . to add insult to food injury , the eggs had a bizarre , chewy texture on their exterior that made them inedible . i decided to abandon it altogether for the side of home fries i ordered which i then realized arrived freezing cold . i thought maybe that ' s how they were prepared but a few at the bottom of the dish were luke warm . my friends ordered the steak dish as well their classic benedict offering and both felt that it was passable but not enjoyable . the sausage under the poached eggs was overcooked as was the steak . their latin rice was okay but had a bit too much smoke for my personal taste . if i regret anything it ' s not selecting the salmon eggs in a corn crepe that passed us by several times and looked delectable . by the end of our meal it was impossible to get the check , even after it took us N minutes to flag down the waiter . i know that this place has tons of reviews saying otherwise but my point is don ' t come for the food . sangria is fantastic . . . all i can hope is that i saved one person from smelling spicy , stinky hot dogs . 
great food , great service from everyone ( kimberly our waitress was very knowledgeable and outgoing ) and this is a great restaurant ! we will be back soon ! 
i love this place . why can ' t all cities towns all over the world have someplace like this ? food was even better than i remembered it . iced mint tea is supermegawonderful ( if a wee tiny bit overpriced imo , i ' d be happier if it were a slight bit larger that ' s what she said ) . 
this place has many different korean dishes at cheap price . always packed . recommend this place to those who want quick korean food
great breakfast , diner style . expertly prepared eggs . great sandwiches . counter seating . eat here . 
i recently ate at strip house with my boyfriend , and we consider ourselve to be some what of restaurant critic , because we love great restaurants , and i must say , after a month of steak houses such as ruths ( very good ) chart house , roots , mortons , i must say after dining at strip house restaurant the other night i havent been able to stop telling my friends about our night , from the appetizers to the filet , to the service , and great vwine , this is by far my first pick as the best steak house in new jersy , and its some what of a hidden gem , being that its in a hotel ( westminister ) . this is my first review on a restaurant ever , but i must say i look forward to trying out there brunch , better yet the waiter told me that they do breakfast every day . if it wasnt for the price tag on the food in which is well worth it , i would probly go twice a week at least . thumbs up for me . 
my friend and i went here for brunch . i ordered the chorizo hash . i would say it was so-so . it was a bit saucy for my taste , and not something i would order again . 
i ' ve been craving thai food for awhile now , and was very happy to have found this place . had tom yum soup , spring rolls and dumplings for appetizers , and the pad thai and red curry as entrees . overall , it was pretty good . my only gripe was the lemon for the pai thai - that lost me on the authenticity right there . it would have been so much better with a slice of lime - so the pai thai came out a little sweeter and not as tangy as i ' m used to . 
the real deal . top N thai in nyc
holy smoly . . go . there . can someone superfreeze some and send it over please ? yummy ! 
great atmosphere with historic charm . incredible burger and a great beer selection . friendly servers provided excellent service . 
fried chicken app is really good . nice marinade before they fry it . the noodles have great texture in the ramen bowl . 
excellent food
all the great food from their soho location , but in a much roomier location . the roasted corn and cuban sandwich are crowd pleasers , but the comfort of the open patio is the main draw . a great place for lunch on the weekend or a casual night out . 
mmm . . . cooorn . . . mmm . . . just thinking about it is making me crave it . i absolutely love this place . if you still havent tried the corn , what are you waiting for ! ! i suggest you go and get some now . 
my favorite diner in the area . the service is good and most of the food is great . i had a sandwich once that had wayyy to much cheese on it but overall a very good experience . the food is a little pricy for a diner but the atmosphere really puts you back into a N ' s diner motif . 
the brunch prix fix for N is a good deal . enjoyed the truffle eggs benedict . eggs poached well and home fries very flavorful and crisp . recommend the hummus with shrimp . great lemon flavor and served warm ! our server was extremely nice and made our stay pleasant . only drawback is lounge music for brunch made me feel like i was eating brunch in the meat packing district . and baklava was missing honey ( too dry ! ) 
amazing place - quiet lower east side bar restaurant - have to try the jalape o marguerita - it has a bite ! i forget the meal i had back in march of this year - some sort of burrito - but it was just flawless ! 
this place is definitely a landmark . i might have been there over N times and for the most part , it has been wonderful . the staff were helpful and served pizza that was worth the wait . however , i did run into some small issues that bothered me over the years and thought i should jot it down below . N . sometimes the square slices in the center were saugy when we order a box N . people like to stare at you real hard while waiting for pizza and with the N min wait , it gets uncomfortable sometimes N . parkin is difficult so dont try unless u are willing to double park N . tables are often sticky but even with all the complains , i still love their pizza so i will keep these N stars ! 
i went twice in the past week . i got a spinach feta omlet the first time and a " spanish " one the second time with their salsa . they put a ton of feta in my omlet the first time , which was great . the " salsa " was more like a tomato pepper sauce , but that was definitely not a problem . each time , my meal was under N . N and the omlets were large . i ' ll be going back often . 
l b is synonymous with home . its what i craved ( aside from my mother ' s arroz con pollo ) when i traveled far and wide . the the spumoni is delish ! whenever i ' m home in brooklyn for a birthday without fail , i will have a spumoni cake from l b ' s with lit candles waiting for me . 
really great pizza ! amazing crust ! lucali ' s may be my favorite place in brooklyn . 
we had food catered for our meetings with our european colleagues and everyone loved the food . everything arrived N min early and they set up everything . 
one of my most favoritest places in philly . huge portions . i have never once finished everything on my plate at this place . the fritattas are excellent , and the biscuits are legendary . i hate having to wait for a weekend breakfast brunch table but i never mind waiting here . it ' s so worth the wait . 
we came to the red cat for thanksgiving dinner i can ' t even begin to say how fabulous it was . from the moment we walked up the steps we were treated like true guests . the service food was impeccable . great wine list ! honestly , one of the best overall meals ever . such a sweet yet sophisticated place . . . and the staff is wonderful ! we can ' t wait to come back ! 
took wife and my daughter , we had a great meal . the manager ( ? ) stopped by our table to see how all was and welcomed us to the restaurant . very nice wait staff
top notch . this place is in a strip mall on the back side of central connecticut state university . i used to think , strip mall must mean so so food . here ' s the thing , my mother , a N year old japanese woman said i had to take her there . that was a year or so ago after my sister took her there on a whim . there are really only N japanese restaurants in central connecticut that will leave you absolutely pleased with how the food is stored , served and presented . this is top notch . i ' ve been to sushi california at least a dozen times . the chef is impeccable . byob . package store N doors down . 
perfect date night restaurant ! ! went on a friday night and was lucky enough to sit at a table outside in front of the restaurant . the drink prices were on par for nyc and the food was amazing . . . definitely would recommend the ahi tuna entree , and i am fairly certain my date enjoyed his steak as there was no food left over . would definitely go back here again ! ! 
great coffee croissants
rafael is an amazing bartender , always a great experience ! the food is always on point and the atmosphere is always welcoming . they have great signature drinks and a great wine list ! ) 
a good place to grab a quick bite . service was overly friendly , and the food was about middle of the line in terms of the shawarma and falafel i have had . it also is very small , so if you go during peak dinner hours , you may be out of luck for seats . but i would definitely recommend going here if you ' re in the area and need some middle eastern cuisine . 
i must say the soul food at this spot is out of this world ! i ordered the rev . al sharpton , a . k . a . chicken waffles . the portions for meat that they offer is out of this world ! i literally had to finish the rest of the chicken for lunch the next day . the corn bread melts in your mouth and the collard greens are phenomenal . i felt like i was at my grandma ' s house with helpings i could not finish - ) i brought my friend from england here and she said " they don ' t cook like this where i live ! " the prices are great for the portions you get . 
loved the food . the service was fair . dont really like congestion in the street however . stay a way between Npm an Nam . a lot of miscreants . oh , the drink menu is really good . mohitos baby ! 
extremely rude service and restaurant policy , our party was told to wait in a tiny space in the back of the restaurant by the restrooms while we waited for our whole party to arrive . the manager snatched away our menus after she seated us at a table for N ( even though we were still missing one person ) . after we were served water and looked at menus , the manager came by and grabbed away those menus , accusing us of trying to trick the system , by telling them we had less people in order to get seated sooner . without listening to our explanations ( that we had told her N beforehand ) she told us to get up . i was really excited to try the restaurant out but after being treated terribly , we left . i ' ve never experienced such terrible customer service and an unwillingness to listen to reason . horrible . for the sake of all that is good and yummy . . . don ' t go . 
let me preface this by saying that my bf had never had ramen that had a meat broth and we finally found a place that had a chicken ramen choice ! we were both super excited to try this place as it looks authentic ( hole in the wall ) and the pictures of the food looked sooo delectable got my usual miso ramen with pork as i do in any ramen place and he got a chicken one . man ! it was saltyyyy ! i love salt to the point where it ' s unhealthy , but this was craziness ! i lost count of how much water i had . unfortunately it wasn ' t good for my bf either and i was disappointed bc we were hoping to find a place we could go together for ramen . . ( luckily we found that place in brooklyn zuzu ramen ! ) the extras were pretty good i guess , but i ' ve def had better . would try again if i was around the area . 
my husband and i have been going here for years , he has never gotten anything besides the crabmeat conqueso which is amazing . i usually go for the chimichanga . the full portions are huge and the salsa is always made fresh . the only complaint i have is the shredded chicken they use to stuff enchiladas , tacos and the chimis is usually dry- i wish they would season it like their shredded pork which is also very good . 
fabulous ! 
terrible ! ! did i say terrible ! ! just read a review where their dogs would not even eat it . i know why . this place is so over rated ! ! ! another disaster all pumped up by tv . i can ' t say enough bad stuff bout this . seriously folks , try subway ! ! 
food bad , service bad , atmosphere cheezy , price expensive . it was a very disappointing experience . we will not return . 
awesome burger joint . came here on a saturday afternoon and ordered cheese fries with bacon , bacon cheese burger ( there ' s a theme lol ) . we ordered a few drafts and watched some football . overall good food and not so bad service . the prices arent bad compared to some burger joints in the surrounding city . i would return back to watch some football and have a burger . 
i ' m updatin to four stars as this place has corrected the most serious problems with their menu , but the menu is still over-sweet and over-rich , really there is so much sugar flowing out of this place from the menu to the taps it ' s a diabetes factory , but it ' s up to you to handle your nutrition - local saturated fats and simpe sugars are still those things , local doesn ' t automatically mean healthy . putting a couple of pieces of kale next to N calories of saturated fats doesn ' t make it healthy . but still , in the tiny market of burlington your options for actually good tasting food on an actually nutritious menu is very limited and when found as expensive as this place . these are ownership mgmt problems . the people who work there and the service is about the best you ' lll find in any college town , and the staff are super super friendly . extra star for you ! 
delicious , authentic french crepes ! pleasant service ! not too expensive ! nice spot for a date night . it ' s small and cozy plus who doesn ' t love a crepe - sweet or savory . 
i work in this area and get lunch to go from here about once a week- they have the best fries in olde city , the wraps are scrumptous and the staff are some of the friendliest people around . the lunch special is a great deal for a quick tasty meal on the go . 
if you ' re around and haven ' t been yet . . . . you ' re missing out ! ! great pizza and atmosphere . cool backyard . hell yeah ! 
great pizza , friendly service and fast delivery . they deserve to succeed in this spot . try them they are worth it . 
great meal . took sister out for dinner . there was a N minute wait so we played some bocce outside and i called from the bocce court and our table was ready . our waitress and the hostess had authentic italian accents . the artichoke bruschetta was excellent . we shared that plus and eggplant parmesan appetizer and then split the ravioli appetizer . perfect amount if food . we cleaned our plates . all that plus a large pour of red wine ( montepulciano d ' abruzzo . ) total was N . N . service was excellent . only N negatives . Nst bread wasn ' t offered but we had bruschetta and probably would have been too full with bread . it would have been nice to have a little piece of bread to soak up the yummy sauce . Nnd negative was that from my N bill they only gave N . N change . of course the change would have been part of the tip but they shouldn ' t assume that . i hope the waitress got it and not the owner . anyway , great italian food and i love bocce while you wait . 
the problem with a lot of indian restaurants in nyc in my opinion is while the food can be good , they lack in the liquor department . . i need booze with my dinner , thank you very much ! the drunken monkey not only serves fantastic indian food ( even having a new anglo-indian specialities ) but great cocktails . the restaurant is small with a very inviting vibe . while i ' m sure they can cater to big groups if you asked them nicely , it is better suited for small get-togethers . looking around , this place was filled with couples on dates ! the staff are friendly and very attentive . the waitress kept checking back on us , asking if everything was okay and if we needed anything . we even got to meet the owners , who were all very friendly and you could tell wanted to make this place stand out . i casually mentioned the need for samosas ( which they said is coming on the menu , yay ) and mango lassis ( an indian smoothie ) . when i even suggested they could make their lassi a boozy one , one of them said " now that , we can do ! " . if they do it , i ' ll be coming back again and again ! i doubt you can go wrong with anything on the menu here . with an anglo-indian centric menu , something will tease your taste buds into ecstasy . for starters , do not miss out on the crispy okra - perfect finger food . crunchy with a little touch of spice . for mains , i had a taste of everyone ' s curry and all was a hit . each comes with rice , several pieces of naan and lemon daal so you get a filling dish for the price . i went with the railway chicken curry , which was excellent . phil h went with the owner ' s recommendation of the fish curry and it was delicious . the cocktails were interesting and complimented the dishes well . i think given that it ' s an indian restaurant , they can go a little more experimental with indian herbs and spices in their cocktails . nevertheless , i enjoyed my drinks for the night ! i ' m glad drunken munkey takes reservations because i ' d hate to miss out on more great meals with friends at this spot ! give this place a shot , you won ' t regret the walk over ! 
had dinner in salt fat last night , very good , food was delicious . i am very impressed with the restaurants in my new neighborhood ! 
this place has to be one of my favorite pizza places of all time . when i get a craving this is the place to be ! any of the specialty slice are a great choice . well man food and very clean ! ! 
i have been to this restaurant twice now , whenever i need my fix of dim sum . the first time , the restaurant was so crazy busy , that we had to get up and get food ourselves ( i don ' t care so long as the food is good and fresh , which it was ) . the second time i went , the pace was much more civilized , and we were served with the dim sum carts . i have had the typical fare here - hargow , siumai , lotus leaf wrapped rice , beef wrapped in rice noodle , shrimp wrapped in rice noodle , spare ribs , beef meatballs , etc . i have been searching for a dim sum place close to my home in nj for the past N months , and i am soooo happy to have one ! ! i will definitely be coming back here again ! 
super good pizza and a super nice bartender , tiffany . she made us bostonians feel welcome and was also knowledgeable about the menu . the salad with local blue cheese was bomb . com and the pizza was of course amazing . they can do half and half if your eyeing two different toppings . great microbrews . great experience . 
eh . i really wanted to like this place . it ' s close to my house and they do have a magnificent beer collection . on sunday however , we went to get lunch . i ' m thinking that you need to be a beer lover to enjoy this place . my fiance ordered a pressed chicken sandwich and i had the mediterranean salad . yes the food is salty as other have mentioned . the worst part for use was the chicken . it was chewy and had no flavor ( other than salt ) . my fiance get trying to eat his sandwich but had to spit so much of it out because he couldn ' t tolerate all the chewing . my expectations were not that high so i wasn ' t upset but i don ' t think i would return . i ' m sure if you were a beer fan then it would be a good place but if you are going for the food - well there are better options in the neighborhood . 
we came on labor day weekend so luckily for us , we had a table outside without waiting . it was a slower day at the restaurant . what did we have that was so good ? the squid ink risotto , the creamy corn pizza and the clam pizza . excellent and refined quality . nothing needed to be added . our waitress was superb . we finished every single bite . all N of us would come back again . 
good food and very nice decor
in summary , the food is not worth the hassle . seating is N metal stools from ikea a bottle of water is N and there ' s no tap water and no alcohol . they were out of the pasta , music was blaring and all over the place , i could hear one of the chefs yelling at someone . it just wasn ' t comfortable . the food was tasty , but i feel like you gotta do better than that in this neighborhood . my advice consider ordering to go . 
yakitori boy is a great place to spend an hour or two munching on snacks and imbibing with friends . it ' s got reasonably priced booze , decent food and , most importantly for this kind of spot , great service . drink prices vary , but if you stick to sake bombs with carafes of sake and the big cans of beer the bill ' s quite reasonable . food is hit or miss . avoid the sushi , as their offerings are forgettable and err on the oversauced side . there are better options in the city even at yakitori boy ' s price point . in contrast , going for skewers is cheap and delicious . i ' ve sampled a large cross section of their yakitori offerings and haven ' t been disappointed with any . standouts include the chicken hearts , short ribs , pork belly , and chicken meatballs . two are perfect for a snack and you can make a meal of five to six . the service and atmosphere at yakitori are great . the layout is conducive to large gatherings and servers adeptly maneuver between your party members regardless of their sobriety ( or lack thereof ) . staff never rushes you and rarely messes up orders , even for huge parties of N . definitely a good spot for drinks and light eats for a group . never had any experience with the upstairs karaoke area though , so can ' t comment on that . 
el sabor es muy concentrado usan demasiadas especies , muy barato comida abundante , el cafe no es muy bueno habra que mejorarlo
went last night and were seated immediately . service is friendly if a little hovering . N of us had the modernized shepherd ' s pie with beef short ribs , carrots and mashed potatoes - omg it was delicious . the sole pasta eater was extremely happy too . will definitely go back , once i ' ve saved my pennies as the prices are on the high side for this area . 
the best seafood in astoria , rather queens . i love this place . whatever you order on the menu cant go bad . i tried every dish there my best dish is every single dish . the swordfish kebob , is really really good , its juicy , soft and full of flavors . the fried shark with garlic potato pure is awesome . and if you have a partener that is not into seafood , dont worry about it they have the best chicken , chops , and steaks . don ' t miss the grilled octopus or the fried calamari . side-orders are amazing wether the lemon potatoes or the rice . the portions are huge so try to leave space for the chefs complement dessert . 
went for buffet lunch-it was good with good variety , but a bit pricey for an indian buffet ! 
we had easter reservations for N N for about N of us . we showed up on time and did not get seated for more than N minutes . had to stand outside with a baby . after we were seated and ordered ( N of us got the rodizio ) we waited until N N when the food arrived . my daughter did not even get her dinner . when i questioned the waiter , the manager came out and said they were cooking it and she could take it home -no charge . ( mind you we were all done eating at this point ) when she got home , it was not anywhere near what she ordered . the service was terrible ! we have eaten there before , but never again . we dropped some good change to wait an hour for food , sit in a noisey - crowded basement and not get out of there full , happy or satisfied . they lost many good customers due to poor service and poor management . never again ! 
just wish they would speak english on the phone and not hangup on people that do , this is america you know . the service is terrible , seems they dont have a proper trained staff . even if the food is good , it doesnt matter as the service is bad . i will not reccomend this place until the service is properly addressed . 
we just had an amazing eating experience here at piacere . every dish was complex and flavorful . pizza dough was light and melted in your mouth . the zucchini timbale was sublime , we had a beet and fennel appetizer that was delicious . we had two pasta dishes we shared . their orrecetta pasta which was homemade with a variety of flours was the best ever with fresh wilted spinach . we had a pasta dish with wild boar that was amazing . service was great and the restaurant feels like home . owner marco uses organic ingredients from local sources and it shows in the food . this will be a regular stop for us
love this place . try to go here once a week when i can . staff is always friendly . i really enjoy the low-key environment and spare decor , with a good mix of people . fantastic coffee and lattes . 
everything from japan is good . i ' ve heard that many times . really ? not from amerika ? i dunno bout that , but they are amazing . japanese people are all about hospitality . it ' s like , " our customers are the gods " they treat their clients well . so there is no waitress with crappy bitchy attitude from old skhool diner by you , yo . their dishes . . . just beautiful . well , it ' s the way to serve tea , but still , you don ' t wanna see the glasses from ikea , right ? so i went down there with my friend to try their tea . wow . i didn ' t know green tea could be served like as they do . authentic ! no sugar . if you are spoiled by arizona tea , don ' t even bother . but taste good . 
i don ' t know what people are talking about , i think the food there is not only great but it is always fresh and the staff are so friendly . 
my favorite place on si . we have their mussels all of the time as well as their grandma pie which is outstanding . the staff is always welcoming and friendly . great atmosphere with amazing food ! ! 
i feel the minimum you should tip is N pct , for bad service . if its really bad service maybe talk to a manager . N cents is sort of disrespectful . but having come here Nx , with my girlfriend , i have to say it was top N worst service i have ever received . the burger was not good at all . my medium rare burger must of been pressed down while it was being cooked . it caused all the juices to seep out . very dry bland burger . totally sloppy . waiter was not rude , but also treated us like he had better things to do . rolled his eyes at me , when i didnt get my drink which i ordered . maybe he didnt hear me ask for a drink , but rolling your eyes ? it left a bad taste in my mouth , and so did the burger . 
while i love these damn empanadas , i am always hesitant to give these people my business . they tend to be a little rude at times . . . almost always actually . and the empanadas are not really cheap . N corn empanadas are just under N dollars , and they are really small . so if you ' re starving , you are going to have to get like , N to N empanadas . and that hardly makes it a balanced meal . so if i ' m starving , it doesn ' t make sense to go here . with that money i can get real food . but are they delicious ? hell yea ! ! ! my favorite are the chicharron and pesto con mozzarella . the green salsa is the best . but they hardly want to give you any extras on a takeout order . . . i ' ve offered to pay them for extra sauce since they really did not want to give me more than N sauces for N empanadas . that ' s why they lose stars . 
i went here with two friends and had a great time . from my both , i had a terrific view of the skyscrapers . the lady who waited on us was very friendly . i thought i was prepared for my order when i choose the salmon entr e it turns out their fish is sushi-grade . i ' ve never been asked to what temp have my fish cooked at , if at all . she was very patient with me on this . i also had their house-made strawberry-lemonade . it was noticeably pulpy , very tart , but still enjoyable . i haven ' t had the patio experience yet . and it ' s cool you don ' t have to go all the way outside to get to the adjoining bar . 
this is a new location for this restaurant , the other being in midtown manhattan . very good service and nice atmosphere though with one too many tv ' s . i ordered a chicken dish which was excellent and wife ordered crispy sweet and sour beef both of which were plentiful and expertly prepared . we had soup dumplings for an appetizer and felt this needed some improvement . highly recommend this place
going back for my second time to walters in almost two years i was horrified . my first time was great . this time a different story . first off the oysters were warm . bad sign . my short ribs burger was , how do i put it , not good at all . from where i was sitting i could see the kitchen staff and that was a major put off . the cooks were dirty and didn ' t look like they cared about anything . sorry to say , i will not go back . 
the only issue i have with this place is that they place some of the food in a plastic container and put it in the heater oven ( ? ) to keep it hot . being very health conscious , i am concerned that the plastic is leaked into my food . i can certainly taste the plastic . . however , it is inexpensive , fast and delicious . you know that everything is fresh because this little gem is always buzzing with people at all hours . sometimes it will be hard to get a seat but be patient ! 
best pizza ever ! ! ! but need to eat while it ' s hot . 
i ate at this place a couple of weeks ago with my wife and daughter , there was sitting available in the garden area and it was very relaxing , the food was excellent , my daughter enjoyed her chicken milanese , everything was yummy , definitely will go back . harry h . 
i don ' t live anywhere near here , but it ' s worth every minute of the drive across the bridge ! always a great selection of drafts , the food is interesting and always well prepared , and john the bartender makes you feel like he ' s glad you ' re there ! 
one of my favorite dishes in nyc is macarroni and cheese from this place . 
onze vrienden die in new york wonen boekten deze plek voor het diner . reserveringen waren een paar dagen van tevoren gemaakt en het was een van de weinige plaatsen die plaatsen beschikbaar had . algemeen was de maaltijd was heerlijk ! ik at niet een van de hapjes want ze hadden vlees in hen en ik ben vegetari r , maar de rest was erg goed . toilet zijn een beetje vuil
went here on a friends recommendation and per yelp reviews . can not tell you how thoroughly disappointed we were . not only are the portions ridiculously small ( even for tapas ) but everything lacked flavor . they even list raw fish within " caliente " section . who does that ? oh yeah , and if you get the gambas shrimp better get ready for some dirty hands as not only do you have to remove the head , you also have to peel the shrimp ' s legs and shell off . wtf ! are they comping me a drink for that , hell no . i felt like i should have been paid to eat that garbage . what a joke ! lastly , don ' t sit at the bar and have a glass of anything unless you ' re eating at the bar . the bar is for diners only and you may get kicked off your bar stool . this place is lucky to still be open . 
a wonderful setting in new modern space near the east river . delicious pork belly and pork chop . a great place for conversation , the tables are not too close together . excellent staff ! friendly , attentive . can ' t wait to return . . . 
my wife says it is the best pizza ever . very small place packed with people . i loved it too
great wings ! ! open late ! ! a bit of a lame crowd , but the wings are good ! the best wings place i ' ve been to in new haven
brunch was underwhelming . and overpriced . N for coffee ? N for a can of soda ? 
i was at bonnie ' s grill last night because i read that the wings were one of the top N in nyc and they kept their promise . i had N medium wings and a small green salad . the salad was actually larger than a regular salad in many other restaurants . the wings ( medium ) were crispy and absolutely delicious . they came with a large amount of carrots , celery and blue cheese dressing . only N . N for a tall boy beer made that experience even better . the servants were very fast and very nice . the spot is just great . the bathroom was clean and everything else felt good . the place is not the place to take your girl on a first date but definitely good to go any other time . i will be back
i normally never go to this area for dinner but my aunt was visiting and staying next door to this restaurant . very nice atmosphere . live music was very nice . we ordered the tuna tartare which was very fresh and delicious and my aunt ordered the fried calamari which i thought was just ok . . . a little spicy which i like but i didn ' t think it was anything special . we all ordered the salmon dish which was also very fresh and delicious . if i ' m ever in this area i would go back . the waitresses were very nice and attentive . 
first time ever going . none of the waitresses were presentable . the order came wrong , the food was oily , the water tasted like used-tub water , and i got food poisoning the same night . so i gave it a chance and it turned out not to be the greatest . 
this place really does deserve N stars . it has never disappointed . i had teh pork chop last night and found myself licking the flavor off the bone . i know its sound gross . . . but trust me when i say it was heaven . the food is bomb and the ambiance isn ' t too shaby either . 
the best gourmet burger in the city ! you have to get the whiskey king , though ! there is no substitute . last time i tried to customize just their regular burger with avacado and cheese , i was pretty bummed that i got two measly slices and charged an extra N or something . the duck fat fries are delicious but not sure they are worth the mega extra calories fat-especially when you should get the cheese sauce to accompany them ) i ' ve also had the butter poached lobster roll . it was insane . jose garces never lets me down . 
i was so impressed by this spot ! ! our server was really great , btw . the three of us shared the linguine with meatballs ( we got extra sauce-just ask ! ) . the noodles were so filling , but i will say that the meatballs itself were too dry for my tastes . the zucchini " chips " were super delicious and hot ! ! i loved how it had cheese on top , and when we dipped it in more red sauce . yummm ! oh , and the peach white sangria was delicious ! N for a pitcher was a reasonable deal . 
love love love . 
the food was good , but not great . as a former mcdonald ' s it still has that atmosphere and the prices are way too high . there are much better choices in burlington , leunigs and sweetwaters both come to mind . 
chicken saltimboca was very good . service very attentive . nice family restaurant . 
every time i go to philadelphia i make sure and stop here . they have the best cheesesteak ! try it with swiss instead of wizz ! 
can ' t really say too much good about the quality of the food and service here . we opened with a delicious artisanal cheese plate and saut ed nantucket bay scallops with a nicely balanced bandidi chianti . vermont pork , quinoa croquettes and their own cured pastrami and home-canned peaches filled out the meal exquisitely . the roaring fireplace rounded out a wonderful snowy evening . 
N years living in astoria and just until today eat at sandfords , the tuna tartar was perfect and the duck burger amazing ! ! ! ! i will try everything from this reataurant
i brought my wife here for her birthday on may Nth and we had a great experience . the staff was nice enough to put happy birthday monica on her menu which we both really appreciated and thought was a nice touch . every dish we had was great ( monkey bread , scallops , octopus and the pastas ) . 
we stopped in on a whim and love this place ! great food and service . we had the chicken caesar pizzetta . . . it was fabulous . for lunch we had pulled pork and the turkey club . both delicious . the decor and ambiance are also fantastic . 
this is one of my favorite restaurants . i live only a couple blocks from the place , and although my friends and i are regular manhattan diners , it ' s such a pleasure having a place like this so close to home . i ' ve taken my out-of-town family and friends here on a couple occasions and they always have a great experience . the atmosphere is great . . . i don ' t think there ' s a single object in the place that is younger N years old . everyone i take here for the first time say they feel like they ' re in a movie or something ( think gangs of ny meets edward scissor hands , meets am lie ) . it ' s definitely got a vibe , but it doesn ' t feel like one of those super contrived atmospheres . the music is always nice ( though sometimes a bit too loud for conversation ) and is complemented with the subway noise overhead which gives it a real old-ny kind of feel . dishes to try i ' ve been here for both brunch and dinner on numerous occasions . for brunch , my roommate and i always share the grilled doughnuts to start out with cappuccinos , then the baked eggs in ham is a must . . so delicious . for dinner , the seasonal artichoke with saffron aioli is usually amazing ( though i did once have a tough artichoke there ) , herbed chicken is great , as well as the mac and cheese . for dessert the bread budding with toffee drizzle ( i think that ' s right ? ) is wonderful ! service is usually pretty good . . friendly , not too in your face , but sometimes a little absent . it ' s not one of those places to go to if you ' re in a rush . but , if you ' re looking for a delicious , slow dinner with some close friends , good music and cool atmosphere , i highly recommend it ! 
i like this place as i do not drink alcohol . great food , fun staff and the chorizo is amazing ! the food was served super fast which was great i was starving ! the prices are what gave it N stars in my book . times are tough , so N . N for N tacos ? yep , me thinks so . 
now that it ' s finally getting warmer out , in riva is a good place to stop for lunch while on kelly drive . we walked there from boathouse row and enjoyed a late lunch on the outdoor patio . we started with the mix and went with our waiter ' s salumi ( prosciutto and coppa ) and formaggi suggestions . i don ' t remember the names of the formaggi we got , but it was a firm and softer one . the softer cheese paired so well with the bread and honey that accompanied the mix . we also shared the polpette diavolo pizza . meatball , pistachio , and hot peppers isn ' t a combination you see too often so we figured why not ? it was pretty good , but i ' d probably try another one of their pizzas before getting it again . while i don ' t plan on going out of my way to drive here , it ' s a good alternative to dining al fresco in center city on a warm spring summer day . 
nice lunch spot for the traveler . good food , no place to eat in though , and not much in the way of outside seating either . 
went for breakfast and the shop is trendy and quite lovely . ordered N breakfast dishes and after ordering the wait was N minutes . for two dishes ? ! there were people who came , ate and left . yet we were here waiting with no explanation other than " it will be right out " after a near hour wait . saw one of our dishes come out and was brought to the wrong table and then returned to the kitchen where it was served about N minutes later . sure wish the service was better or at least an explanation was offered . food was ok , menu was creative and eclectic , but service sorely lacking . 
perkins offers a multitude of different homestyle cooked meals at a pretty decent value . i will typically order a soup and sandwich combo , or a salad . generous portions with the salad entrees . the taste is exactly what you would think , it ' s perkins . it ' s not going to astonish you . but nor will it disappoint . service is satisfactory . 
grimaldi ' s pizza is probably one of the best i ' ve ever had . the cheese is just amazing and the crust is a perfect blend of thin and crispy yet breadlike and flavorful . the service is friendly and the atmosphere is low key and excitable . this is an authentic bare bones pizzeria , the interior looks like it hasn ' t been touched in N years . even the sign outside has had some strange plastic hanging off the awning for the past few years . the only reason i don ' t eat here all the time is the wait . i went here on saturday afternoon and waited for an hour and a half . it was a gorgeous day , so it wasn ' t a problem , and i ' d have to say that nothing tasted better than that first sip of beer once we were seated . the only thing i ' d change is that i wish they had some sort of a green salad on the menu to start off with , but i am sure i am one of the few with that request ! 
delicious food . awesome atmosphere . the outside garden is like stepping out into another country . definitely worth a visit . 
i appreciate grass fed beef burgers . 
my special lady and i went here for our anniversary dinner . we made reservations . once we arrived we were swiftly lead through the dining room and bar , past a few open N-tops , down a flight of stairs into -you guessed it- the basement . greeted by a faint smell of bleach and the closeness of our booth counterparts ( literally almost sitting at the same table ) we took our seats on the back wall directly on the other side of the men ' s restroom appetizing to say the least . the service was great , the food was very good , but the vibe was quite odd . as the customers came and went from the bowels of tinto we noticed a trend , most of the cellar dwellers seemed to be slightly less fabulous than the bourgeoise on the upper decks . we couldn ' t help but feel a bit profiled . if you plan on going to tinto i suggest you bust out the prada slacks and the gold tipped cane or face the possibility of being the steerage seated in the basement ! 
totally amazing ! ! ! what can i say , food was delicious , we tried the trini chicken , chicken etouffe , both dish was full of flavor , each entree came with soup and salad . both the soups gumbo and vegetable soup was awesome . only thing its byob , which isnt so bad since the liquor store is literally next door . service was great , both the waiter and waitress were super friendly . i would highly recommend trying the restuarant out . 
the best selection of draft beer in nh . especially good at happy hour when they are all half price . a mature crowd frequents this authentic looking bar . uniquely tasty burgers and friendly staff . 
delicious ! and the waitstaff is incredibly friendly , helpful , and welcoming . honestly the nicest hostess and waitress that i ' ve met in a very long time . the food came out at just the right time-- not too fast as though they ' re trying to hurry things along and not too slow so it doesn ' t get awkward for you and your guest . i feel like their vegetarian option is lacking so that may be something to watch out for if people in your party don ' t eat meat . the filet mignon with foie gras is absolutely delicious ! just the right portion size too . 
if you are wanting a colonscopy , this would be the place . . . didn ' t stop shitting all night
hmm . i ' ve just started going to pepe ' s in west orange about N months ago , though i ' ve known of the place in west orange for about N years now i guess , as i frequent the chinese place next to it . anyway , as mentioned i finally tried it about N months ago , and have held off writing a review of it until i had eaten there at least N-N times . not sure about the a couple reviews that can be found , but the food is excellent there , i mean absolutely delicious , made home style . mind you , i ' ve not had the entire menu - primarily the pork beef ribs , rice french fries , lomo saltado the peruvian style steak served with eggs - they offer more of course but not had everything never had a problem with portion size , etc . actually , it ' s quite a value - especially N large rib order with a choice of N sides . . . it ' s a full N meals , at least . so you get N home made delicious peruvian bbq meals for about N a piece . not sure how one goes wrong in that scenario . most stuff is made to order , with a couple items pre-made ( but not frozen and fried ! ) . - jonathan sands
i ' ve read a lot of reviews on here for marrakesh and noticed that some say N courses while others say N courses . here ' s the truth it doesn ' t matter ! it ' s a ton of food and it ' s all worth the N per person charge . this place is awesome ! service was great and very welcoming and the atmosphere was dark and inviting . here ' s a quick overview - yes , it ' s down a little alley off of south street ( right before Nth ) - yes , you have to knock ring the doorbell to be let in - yes , it ' s dark - yes , you sit at a couch around a round table - yes , you eat with your hands ( with the exception of the couscous course ) - no , the chicken isn ' t dry . ( i ' m not sure how this could even be possible . ) - it ' s not listed as a byob and has alcohol available , but the larger party next to us brought bottles and the server gladly opened it for them - yes , the meals are lengthy ( our party of N was there for N . N hours ) - yes , it ' s really only N person ( plus tax , tip drinks ) go here - you will not be disappointed ! bring friends ! 
simply put , this place is real bad . we landed in this restaurant because another planned location we were gonna visit was closed . so we visitied this saturday N N N for lunch buffet . any takeout restaurant in the area will have more and better choices for less . the chicken tandoori was " old " - really . the chicken-something ( i forget the name now ) was definitely a left-over from another party supply . only one simple rice ( few pieces of paneer trying to prop their head out ) offering . one daal ( never bothered to try ) . cold ( even though it was on top of heating device ) paneer pakodas . and last but not to mention dessert - small gulab jamuns ( probably some cheap canned ones ) and fruits . most of the staff is either new or inexperienced . so you can imagine the service , even though i have seen worse . don ' t blame me . i warned you . 
for real love this place . food is always spot on and unique , you can tell it ' s fresh and made with love ( duck sliders yummy ) . bottle selection is top notch , fairly priced for the area and drafts are always well balanced and great ! the bartenders is awesome and knowledgable . only complaint . . . what ' s with the gimmicky events ? ? keep it up bottle bar , i only wish there was one in jersey where i ' m from . 
great spot to go if you have a big group of indecisive people . we had shrimp skewers , short ribs and goat cheese plates and each was better than the last . i can ' t wait to go back to try them all . staff was super friendly and helpful too ! 
i have been to the lunch buffet at karma numerous times as well as catered with them for a special event . i have been very pleased with karma so far . karma probably has the best indian lunch buffet in the philadelphia area . the selection is very large and nice mix of north and south indian cuisine . more recently , they had catered my son ' s baptism . it was an event for around N people . the food was great many of guests actually came up to us afterwards and complimented on our selection . in addition , they set everything up and provided drinks and silverware . they were very professional and reasonable price-wise . we will definitely use them again to cater . 
delicious and friendly service ! my husband and i were in nyc for a week and i think we stopped by here three times for the margherita and grandma ' s pizza . the owner even recognized that we were repeat customer on on second visit - super nice guy who make his customers feel welcomed and appreciated . 
still a solid choice after all these years . a touch dated but worth it if you are in the area . 
after hearing my friends recount the breakfasts they ate while visiting japan recently , i decided i needed a japanese breakfast today . okonomi did not disappoint . the basics of the meal are brown rice topped with seasoning , soup , and broiled fish accompanied with a few sides . today ' s fish were ocean perch and bluefish . it ' s prime bluefish season in new york and i ' d had the perch before , so i chose the former . it was mildly marinated and perfectly grilled - delicious . it is a strong-flavored fish , but i love these kinds of fish . for my rice , i added uni , which was lightly dressed , in addition to regular topping and it was a great foil to the bluefish . all-in-all , yuji and team knocked it out of the park again . 
ok , so it ' s jose tejas time ! i ' ve been going there for many years and the food is always consistently good . they never miss a beat with your entree . you will order and get the same quality of food every time . with that said , there are definitely better tex mex places out there , not in the area tho and not for the always low cost of jose tejas . their drinks don ' t disappoint and it is always a fun atmosphere . i don ' t like the jambalaya , stick with the rice and beans side but even that isn ' t so great . if you want enchiladas or a burrito you won ' t be disappointed although you ' re not going to get the sauce selection of more authentic restaurants . just a plain , red sauce here . overall it ' s enjoyable and an easy eat if you stick with their basics . it ' s always packed so expect to wait . 
super yum
my wife and i went to meal last weekend on a recommendation from a friend and boy do i owe my freind a favor . . . this was by far one of he best meals i have had in a long time ( pun intended ) , and when i say meal that encompasses not only the food but the service , price , and atmosphere as well . . after being sat immediately we were promptly and enthusiastically greeted by a young fellow named steven who informed us that we were in for quite a treat upon learning this was our first time at the restaurant . all i ask for in a waiter is someone who is nice and genuinely give a hoot about taking care of us , but this server went above and beyond and truly made sure that we were comfortable . the menu had so many great choices that i didn ' t know what to pick but once again our sever helped push us in the right direction , after giving us a flawless breakdown of the specials he informed us that meal excels in steak dinners and how all the steaks on the menu are of a specific high quality grade beef and they are cooked at a certain temperature with butter salt and pepper and that no matter how rare we liked our steaks it would still have that nice crispy char on the outside , but when they have special steaks they are usually very high quality . he made the kc steak ( bone in ny strip . . . which i had no idea prior ) accompanied by a full plate of goods as opposed to the normal ala carte sound so good that i couldn ' t refuse and let me tell you it was worth every penny , just as thue server said nice and red and juicy on the inside and perfectly charred and crisp on the outside , not to mention everything else was phenomenal as well ( french onion soup with sherry , truffled creamy blue cheese potato chips with bacon bits , tuna tartar , and my wife got the cowboy steak which our server said was his personal favorite from the regular menu , and our sides creamed spinach with almonds and truffle , saut ed mushrooms and beer battered onion rings ) . i know i have went on a bit of a ramble here but that is how good this place is , but now my fingers are starting to hurt due to my early onset arthritis so i will wrap this up . . . my final grades atmosphere - a price - a service - a food - a bottom line as soon as you get the chance go have a meal at meal ( and from what i ' ve heard they have a fabulous sunday brunch also ) you will leave with a smile and a full stomach and you will not regret it ! 
so good . so fresh . somehow N people managed to eat N large pizza ' s . . . and we were all on " diets . " i thought i was waiting in line at an amusement park . as frustrating as it may be , bring someone ahead of time to hold your hand and make sure you don ' t leave and remember me saying it ' s so worth the wait . this sign there says something like we are not responsible if you choke on seeds or pits ? i thought this was a joke . that ' s the greeting i get after standing here like a jack a all day ? i ' ll translate it ahead of time . . . . our ingredients are so fresh the pits are still in our olives . fresh mozzarella like you ' ve never had before . that sign has really put a damper on all my other pizza experiences because now i search and search for it and understand why no where else can get away with it . 
what ' s not to like about any ruth ' s chris steakhouse ? excellent food . top notch service . always . 
great happy hour here ! was out with some artist friends we chose this spot because of their inexpensive happy hour ( N yuenglings N rail cocktails ) . the space is comfortable which long benches and couches . also , there ' s a very curious painting of the nyc skyline right now . check it out . 
can ' t visit nyc without stopping by and getting junior ' s . their cheesecake is to die for . since i go to the times square location , it could get pretty packed . i decided to go near closing and was able to get a seat quick . after a long day of touring , you work up a great big appetite . i got an open face turkey sandwich . boy , that sandwich was big and delicious . they did not skimp on the gravy and that made the meal that much better . i had to get one of their famous cheesecakes . ended up with the red velvet while my girlfriend got the strawberry shortcake cheesecake . i made a bad decision . the red velvet was too rich while the strawberry shortcake cheesecake had a perfect balance of cheesecake and shortcake . if you are deciding what cheesecake to get , the strawberry shortcake cheesecake is the way to go . 
let me start by saying i am italian so i know an authentic italian meal when i taste one , this place is remarkable , i got their bus card from the fresh pasta place next door and after reading countless great reviews i went to have dinner with with my bf , he is french ( and very picky ) . . . . and even he thought it was amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! food , service , atmosphere , i felt like we were not even in new york . whomever reads this has to stop by for a bite , you will not regret it . fantastic . after being in new york for ten years it was so nice to sit down to a meal with people that actually served you as though you were family . wow . 
i like this place ! firstly , the menu is just straight up comfort food - or what i perceive as comfort food , anyway . there ' s no " new american " frills or fancy diversions - it ' s just italian american food done well . the lack of pretentiousness carried through to its dishes - solid cooking , non-artistic presentation , but so delicious . i really enjoyed the lentil with smoked bacon soup and the sweet sausage over polenta . it just tasted so fresh and familial and homey , but not in a " let me try to give you a warm intimate experience " but here ' s some good food , eat it and be happy . i was happy . 
we ' ve never been to the restaurant , so i can ' t comment on it . for delivery , these guys are pretty great . their delivery time is reasonable . the food is a touch on the expensive side for chinese food , but the portions are generous so whatever . the food is pretty good , especially for delivery , although not outstanding . they don ' t have fortune cookies , which is a bit of a disappointment for my kids ( ok , let ' s be honest , it ' s a disappointment for me ) although they do send those little fried wonton cracker noodle things . we ' ve ordered from these guys several times now , and they ' re our go-to for delivery chinese food . 
went to dinner last night at sampan with a group of N after hearing there was a N minute wait at barbuzzo . our server ron effectively explained the menu to us and guided us through it . i ordered the the korean bbq satay , general tso dumplings , and brussel sprouts . everything came out quickly and was delicious . one of my friends didn ' t like her ceviche . our server was attentive enough to notice that she barely touched it and asked if anything was wrong with it . even though she said there wasn ' t and that it just wasn ' t for her , he still took it off the bill . we ended the evening with trix and lucky charm flavored ice cream . i ' m excited to return , especially to try out the happy hour . 
just went today ( a crummy drop in weather which good ramen temp ) and had a pretty good meal . had a short wait , this place is pretty busy during lunch . service was attentive . had shisito peppers for an app , not bad , nothing special ( altho w e salt mixture it comes with is friggin addictive ) had the lunch special which comes with a salad and a side of rice . i had the spicy pork , which was not spicy but still good . comes with some mayo sauce which i wasn ' t a big fan of . anyways , who cares about all of that , you come here for ramen . i had the karaka-men which is the spicy version . broth was quite tasty , well developed . i had the egg with it ( N extra . . . rather offensive pricing ) and it comes with pork chashu which is very good , but you only get N pieces . noodles are great and you can get a Nnd order of noodles for N more . i really like the noodle type . good consistency and again , the broth was flavorful . i thought overall the meal was a bit overpriced and while the ramen was good , its not something i ' d have withdrawal symptoms if i forego it for a period of time . was quick service as even with a short wait we were out within an hour , so doable if you work nearby for lunch . more of a N . N than a N , but i ' m going to a N stead of a N mainly due to what i will geekily dub the cost taste ratio . 
delicious food and great people . the staff is so friendly and nice ! if you go too much it can get repetitive , adding variety to specials is encouraged as well as maybe healthier less greasy meal options . tiny thai is also byob which is a nice plus . i really love their seafood and duck specials . 
excellent food . . even better ( if possible ) i s the feeling of family luciano , anthony and maria create with their attention and sincere caring . excellent catering . . . and personal attention . highly recommended . . . . egggplant and hats is the best ! 
this is a little spot , that is a good healthy pick for a bite . please order online or by phone , then just go pick it up , or other wise you will be on an line that sometimes extends outside . place is small to eat inside . the sandwiches and salads very tasty . the soups and side bites also very good . the hot pressed sandwich are a crowd fave . the tunisian style tuna with egg whites and the pastrami wraps are my fave . check the menu for all items available , and online or on phone for daily soup lineup . as for regular style sandwiches , go with the crunchy tuna or chimi chicken . for sides the baked sweet potato pieces or the courgette ( fresh zucchini strips with olive oil are good choices . also hot and cold drinks available . the lemonades are above average as well as the hot drinks . just check out menu online , you will find something good to munch on . 
thanks to the bouncers for helping me connect with the birthday party i was so many hours late for last saturday night . you ' re the best ! love this spot for a quieter sunday afternoon beer . 
jrp is a legendary establishment . i have been coming here religiously for the last N yrs ! i am a bit of a chessesteak snob and johns is one of N spots in the city where i will order a cheesesteak ( its also my fav ! ) . i ' ll only order a cheesesteak when john himself is workin the grill . the man has the magic touch and he has more pride in making a cheesesteak than anyone else in philly period ! its seriously not the same sandwich if someone else is making it- john is a master ! if im not ordering a cheesesteak , than i usually getting a roast pork or beef or a chicken cutlet parm ( w extra gravy ) . jrp is truly a quintessential philly sandwich spot for the people ! for me , it doesnt get much better than housing one of their sandwiches while sitting outside on a nice day ! 
i ' ve been to pat ' s multiple times and it ' s absolutely the real king of steaks ! i have yet to try tony luke ' s , as i hear it ' s also very good , but compared with regards to pat ' s compared to geno ' s there is absolutely no competition . first , they do not need any type of over the top promotional decor to attract customers because once you try their cheesesteaks you know who to go to for your next one . i ' ll do my best to describe their " cheesesteak wit " . once you receive the cheesesteak , you can head left to the condiments where you can add hot sauce , ketchup , whatever you want onto it , but i prefer to keep it the way it is because adding anything else would just interfere with the original taste . once you take a look at the cheesesteak you immediately notice that it is greasy , oily and full of steak juices . the bread just soaks up all those juices and softens up quickly so you have to dig right into the cheesesteak asap . however , the moistened bread goes fantastic with the juicy steak and abundance of cheese they put on it . the bread is not hard , so it ' s very easy to digest with bites of the steak . the flavors of soft slices of juicy , hot steak with the cheese wiz are blended so perfectly here . the juices incorporated into the bread make chewing and digestion very easy . that is why pat ' s is the king of steaks ! 
delicious . if you can stand the wait ( and its worth it ) they are definitely in my top N pizza places to eat in brooklyn . 
i would give it a N . N emporio turned out to be quite a pleasant experience . overall i would call it " solid " ( as a fellow yelper wrote ) italian restaurant in terms of variety , taste , ambience and value . we got there a bit earlier than the couple we were meeting and got a chance to take advantage of their N happy hour drinks ( wine , beer etc ) everyday they have this deal until N N i believe check it out ! our party of four started off with a few cheese offerings and some wine leading to the following entr e choices my entr e was the tagliatelle al rag pasta was a nice al dente the meat sauce was basic and tasty but after a few more bites i would say it was a bit over-salted my husband got the the seafood special pasta with sea urchin , muscles , etc it was definitely better than mine , both were perfectly cooked but the sauce on this dish was better executed and seasoned overall a the couple we went with ordered the margherita pizza which i myself did not try but looked pretty solid they also ordered the setaro mezzi rigatoni alla gricia which i must say was the best of all the options . i was actually thinking of order this but opted for something more simple ( i was very jealous afterwards ! ) flavor infused , perfectly cooked and you could taste the flavor of the guanciale in each bite . yummmo ! a for this dish i would reccommend trying that and the seafood pasta special ( i forgot the name but it had sea urchin in it ) conclusion pros ambience , variety , staff , quantity quality of food cons gets packed so go early
this place is great , as long as you don ' t go for saturday brunch . . the line is consistently out the door . go on a weekday . love the feel . love the homemade specialities . 
the thirsty koala is one of the best new restaurants in astoria . the food is so flavorful ! there are also gluten free options on the menu . we absolutely loved the ginger beer battered mahi and chips with thai basil yoghurt . the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the chef kathy even stop by our table to say hello and see how our meal was . we had a fantastic dinner and look forward to inviting our friends to join us next time . 
went looking for melagrano and stumbled across audrey claire . very loud inside as the outside tables had over an hour wait . very pleasant menu and wait staff and service was very good . ordered the brussell sprouts for an appetizer and were not cooked enough . had a hard time slicing them with a knife . the trout with crab meat and spinach was good but a bit over salted . would try again but wasn ' t overjoyed with first visit . 
everything a nj pizzeria should be , open counter where you can see them make the pies , and booth seating to enjoy your slice . i travel a lot and always come back to anthony franco ' s to reset my palate on what a pizza should taste like . besides the delicious plain slice , they have a great selection of specialty slice pies available including buffalo chicken , philly cheese steak , and chicken marsala . daily lunch specials from the kitchen never disappoint either . 
i work close to them and we order there often . it ' s always a great place to eat . the bagels are fresh and i love the variety of bagels and cream cheese . we get the mexican wrap and the salmon wrap quite often . both are very customizable and they make them so quickly . in the many months that we ' ve been ordering there , we ' ve only had one bad batch . the sandwiches weren ' t made like we ordered them , but the staff was so receptive to fixing the mistake . we still love them ! i highly recommend them for breakfast and lunch . 
price is good and i tried the fish taco , the steak taco , and the cheeseburger . . . they were all awesome
yum yum yum ! first tried joe ' s shanghai ( midtown ) about five or six years ago and i had been thinking about them ever since . i ' ve since tried a couple of places including dtf , but love the thicker chewier wrapper of joe ' s shanghai , just a personal preference . finally got a chance to go to nyc again and decided to try the chinatown location because of the lower prices and we were going to be at the N N memorial anyway . we got there a little after N and snagged the last small table . got three orders of dumplings to share . we got pork as well as pork and crab . once we got to the last steamer , we realized that we couldn ' t tell which ones had the crab in it . so my advice would be to skip the crab and save a couple of bucks since you can ' t taste it anyway . we were more than satisfied with the dumplings and didn ' t order any other food . once we left , the restaurant was packed and there were a bunch of people waiting outside . highly recommend the chinatown location if you don ' t care about ambiance . 
great brunch
i had never really noticed mccrossen ' s tavern when i had been in the fairmount neighborhood before , but my friend had made reservations for dinner there through the eastern state penitentiary ' s " fright and a bite " offer , so i gave it a try and i ' m glad that i did . the food , from appetizers through dessert , was all delicious . they had a respectable beer list , very good cocktails , and great service . and the environment is pleasant . . . it ' s casual but classy , the decor makes sense and balances having elements that go together with avoiding the mass produced feel of having them match excessively . 
cafe lift is easily a five star establishment . i ' ve walked by this joint dozens of times on my way to tango , but have honestly never noticed it . i thought it was a coffee shop more so than a restaurant . the decor is almost industrial like , with cool paintings along the walls . the restaurant is pretty large as well , which makes sense since rent is probably much cheaper here than in center city proper . service at cafe lift was excellent - the waitresses were incredibly helpful , friendly , and happy in general . food at cafe lift was equally great - we had the eggs florentine ( poached eggs with spinach , crab meat , potatoes , truffled hollandaise all served with two slices of italian bread ) , sausage frittata ( spicy italian fennel sausage , spinach , and mozzarella cheese ) , and the cannoli french toast ( challah bread , cinnamon vanilla custard , bananas , chocolate , pistachios , ricotta cannoli filling ) . each dish was seasoned perfectly , with little room for improvement . the cannoli french toast is a must try . i ' m hungry again just writing this review . i normally would ding a restaurant one star for being cash only , but the food and service here was good enough that i won ' t this time ! 
it ' s gone downhill since the owners split up . michael is doing a great job of running it , but the food quality and ambience just isn ' t the same ! the waffles are soggy now and prices for things like " toasts " have gone up . i ' m glad that the menu standards are still there , but i think this business needs some invigorating . 
N . N stars . my friend treated to a very belated birthday meal ( hey , better late than never , right ? she ' s awesome . why can ' t more people be as dependable and reliable like my dear friend ? ) we walked from astor place to avenue a , while being tempted by an array of ethnic and appealing restaurants along the way . at first , our heart was set on pylos because she wanted to have greek and i wanted to see the terra cotta ceiling , but after seeing the menu , we realized the prices aren ' t the same as their website . of course , more expensive now and i didn ' t think it ' s right for me to ask her to spend so much money on me ( she ' s getting married soon and needs all the to pay for many many expenses . yep , that ' s marriage life for ya ) . also , the setting was really intimate , which wouldn ' t allow for our loud voices . by then , we were like , " aaa . . . where to go now ? " i ' ve tried Na before , so we decided to go into yuca . actually , i ' ve secretly checked out the menu online already , and for an entree , a drink , and coffee tea for N . N , that ' s a pretty good deal . well , it ' s a good deal only if you get the entree or sandwich because the salad comes a la cart and for the portion , it ' s definitely not worth the N . how come salads are always so skimped ? it ' s only greens ! i have to say that at least it wasn ' t wet , but for like N cups of field greens , a couple of halved grape tomates , maybe a tablespoon of grilled corn and slices of avocado , it should be more like N instead , especially since no bread was provided . i asked for some black beans and that side dish is another N . N . well , at least i enjoyed the beans . i looove cuban black beans . i actually used them as my ' dressing ' . but my friend ordered the arepa special with chorizo , eggs , cheese and avocado spread with a side of hash browns ( a mixture of potatoes and yam ) and she was very happy with it and the portion was so huge , she could only put a dent on that big plate . at least she was happy . service-wise , it was slow . my water was never refilled and the area isn ' t very clean ( sticky floor , ripped seats and sticky tables ) . well , that ' s what happens when you do happy hours the night before , but Na seems to be much cleaner . so the moral of the story is . . the brunch prix-fixe is a deal only if you order the entree ( as a vegetarian , that ' s to my disadvantage since the selections consisted of mostly eggs and meat ) . i ' m glad i came though , but there are other places around the area for me to try next . if i ' m ever filthy rich , maybe i ' ll treat my friend to pylos when it ' s her birthday . oh shoot , her birthday is coming up . . . ok , unless i win the lottery , it ' ll be the N pizza place for us . lol . juuuuust kidding . i love her too dearly to only spend a single digit--priced meal on her . actually , we ' ve already decided where to go next and it ' s also on st . mark ' s place . perhaps you ' ll see a review soon enough . in the meantime , happy brunching everyone ! 
went here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it . the wait staff is still getting the hang of things ( a lot of running around ) but that could just be because they ' re so busy ! they must be doing something right . we decided to try a little bit of everything , and when we couldn ' t decide between the mashed mint peas or the sweet potatoes , the server ( who was also a co-owner ) brought both out for us to try ( and only charged us for one ! ) . they seem really excited about their food and what they bring to the culinary atmosphere of ditmars , which with all the thai and sushi places lately has been lacking , for sure . the food was great , the service was great , and the location is perfect . what more can you ask for ? 
amazing food , and i saved N , you can print the coupon here alturl . com biNiN dont wait ! 
we started seeing the iconic steak joint in geico commercials and decided to give them another visit for nostalgia sake . so many great options for steaks around the globe these days and better choices in philly , but still nice for photo op and whiz ! 
great beer selection and service however was disappointed with my fish and chips . fish was over fried , oily . onion ring basket however was great . low marks on food but great beers and atmosphere . 
i came to dinner at smokin ' betty ' s on a double date and i was happily surprised . based on some of the reviews , i wasn ' t sure i was going to enjoy my meal or the place in general but i did ! after walking in i was immediately happy with the ambiance and feel of the place . i was expecting a super casual bbq joint but the decor gave off a bit of a trendy hip feel to it which i enjoy when i make an effort to get dressed and go out to eat ! it is by no means over the top but the lighting was fun and overall i was happy with the appearance of the joint . for dinner , i got the pulled pork sandwich , the boyfriend got the bbq salmon , and the other couple got the sliders and the smokin ' betty burger . the pulled pork and other sliders were great ( except the chicken was bland ) and the burger was gigantic and had an egg on it ( anything with an egg on it is a-ok in my book ) . the only average entree was my boyfriend ' s salmon , which he said was good , but nothing special , just simple . sides were all enjoyable ( mashed sweet potatoes tasted like pumpkin pie and the mini corn bread muffins were cooked nicely as well ) . i ' ve already recommended this place to some of my friends who are into bbq with a twist ! 
i know turkish food involves a lot of lamb dishes of which i ' m not the biggest fan , however if it ' s prepared in such a way that subdues the gaminess , then i ' m , well , game . we decided to order takeout and selected the meatball platter and the iskender kebab . the grilled meatballs are made of beef and lamb and served with N types of rice , one appears to be more like bulgur , french fries , plus a couple slivers of grilled green peppers . the meatballs did have more of lamb flavor but i was ok with it . overall the dish was heavy on the salt and carbs and i could have used more of those grilled peppers . if the rice was plain and unsalted , i could have eaten more . the iskender kebab was describes to us as " a very special dish . " essentially it ' s the thin slices of gyro meat ( lamb ) served over fried bread and then covered with a tomato sauce , with a side of yogurt . what i liked about the dish was the fried bread that was soaked in the sauce , making it almost like bread pudding . the combination of the thin meat , soaked bread , the sourness of the yogurt was very unique . it took a few bites to understand what i eating . at the end i decided i liked it , but it ' s not one of those dishes i could devour . perhaps , i will give this place another chance and dine in . 
this is a place worth the wait for seating . there is a reason you have to wait . the place has great atmosphere , good food and very reasonable pricing . lines of people are to be expected . still , if i had company from out of town , i would not hesitate to bring them here . i found my server to be very friendly as was the owner , who came by the table to see that all was good . seating was comfortable . i really enjoyed my first time and will be back with friends very soon ! 
first off , i honestly never write reviews for places , but i felt compelled after my last visit to prime N . i frequent this place often and i have to say it ' s got to be the best burger around . throw in a vast beer selection and great ambience and you have a recipe for success . i got " the smoker " on my last visit and it was fantastic , but i can honestly say i ' ve never had a less than amazing burger at any visit . the staff is always super friendly and knowledgeable , especially our server angela . she made it an absolute pleasure to be there . i strongly encourage anyone to visit this restaurant . 
good sandwich , good size , decent price . please have more of the pork belly . we had the pulled pork . good , need a little more sauce or some vinegar . reminds me of banh mi sandwiches with the carrots and other veggies . a-ok . 
the staff is incredibly nice , the ambience is cozy and fun , and the guacamole is out of this world . carino is one of the most consistently delicious restaurants on the south side . 
last night , my brother and i walked way down into the hook looking for a decent , informal sort of place to eat . when we first spotted this place , we thought " perfect , time to get our fried fish on ! " unfortunately , when we showed up , we were told that they were no longer seating people and we couldn ' t be served . this was at N N . on a friday night . wtf ? ! ? we were told that because the kitchen closed at N , they couldn ' t possibly fry us up some fish between N N and N . i mean , how hard can it be to fry up some fish in an hour and a half-- they seemed to have plenty of people working there , and there was an empty table directly in front of us . and it ' s not like there are lots of other restaurants nearby it ' s kind of out in the boonies , so if you are refused service ( at N N , on a friday ! ) , you don ' t have a lot of other options . we wound up eating at the fairway , which is probably a better bet . . . 
amazing comfort food ! went for brunch and the following was fabulous chicken waffles , french toast ( omg so good ! ) , fresh mini donuts ! drinks were good too , had sangria and the " union ave " . they even have a variety of syrups ( homemade ) sitting on the bar if you want to craft your own cocktail . 
food was great ( what i had of it ) . service was lousy . everyone at my table received their entrees , except me . busboy who delivered them mentions to the waiter that i don ' t have an entree . waiter comes over and tells me he will check on my order with the kitchen . he returns a few minutes later to ask what i ordered ( turkey milanese ) . after N minutes , everyone finishes their entrees . my entree finally arrives . i tell the waiter i don ' t want it . we had to leave for a concert . it is then that the waiter tells me my entree is on the house . no explanation for the delay . while the waiter later apologizes and took responsibility for never putting in the order , i never had dinner . the waiter could have explained the situation at the outset and offered a replacement that could have been prepared quickly . the owner made no attempt to apologize or make the situation right . 
i had dinner one night at lucky N and really enjoyed my experience . our server was super attentive and pleasant and my friends and i all liked our food . i had " the middle eastern " , a plate of pitas , hummus , feta and other assorted goodies . it ' s listed under the " small or sharing " portion of the menu , but take heed , it ' s definitely a " sharing . " it was a huge platter , but over the course of the meal i worked through most of it because it was so tasty . my friends had the lucky burger and the wings . they were both satisfied with their meals . the burger was huge -- come hungry ! at any rate , no complaints at all about this place . it was pretty clean and friendly . pair that with good food , a great beer selection , and reasonable prices , and you ' ll find that there ' s no reason not to check this place out . 
so , this was out Nst visit here . it ' s on my list of restaurants to check out . personally , i didn ' t think the food was all that great . i ordred the chicken shawarma plate , the rice and salad that comes with it was wonderful . the chicken was dry and chalky . the little bit of seasoning used didn ' t permeate into the chicken . hubby ordered the mixed grill plate , again the rice and salad stood out . we had the falafe . nice and crispy on the outside , but no flavor on the inside . it had the right amount of salt , but flavoring spices were missing . personally when i think of mediterranean food , i think of the wonderful spices . unfortuantely this was sadlly lacking from the dishes we ordered . maybe they were having an off day , but i don ' t see me revisiting here anytime soon . 
excellent pancakes . we ordered the special local , fresh blueberry and peach pancakes . for someone who does not like pancakes , these were incredible . the blueberry scones were pretty delicious as well . 
small and cute shop but with some delicious tasty food to offer . everytime i pass by this restaurant , it ' s always packed with people so finally i had my chance since i got here at N for dinner . so lesson learn , come early if you wanna eat here . my friend and i ordered the chicken buns and shrimp tempura shu mai . then i ordered the spicy ramen and my friend ordered udon . every single food was delicious packed with full flavors ! i must say i was very satisfied leaving my tummy very very happy . the servers were very attentive and service was quick ! i would definitely come back here ! 
came here with an english co-worker who wanted something different than the chain irish pubs littered throughout the city . overall a good experience . i would rate the atmosphere and decor at a N , the food was pretty rich and we tried the scotch egg which was outstanding and the bone marrow which i didn ' t really care for but it was ok . the bacon wrapped meatloaf was excellent and others loved the chicken pot pie . my only draw backs were the temp , it was hot in the restaurant and the selection of english beer was poor . how can you not have boddingtons on tap ? overall a four star maybe slightly higher rating . 
new to mall next to cheesecake factory light entree tiplalia was tasty brio rewards program difficult to use we like the margrithia flatbread but wished it was on whole wheat not white bread
worst experience ever ! ! ! for N . N hours nobody had any food in the back room . the waiter was running around with empty hands . a table left after waiting for N hour with nothing on the table . they need more waiters and cooks . 
the bf and i only had to wait N minutes haha in your face ) i recommend everyone to sit at the counter to avoid the wait . don ' t even think about going with more than N people . the night before we tried to get seated but were told that we needed to wait N hours . . . crazy . we wrote our name down but by the time they called , we were already home . entrees N fav - bolognese ball hero with pesto sauce ( mozzarella white bread ) . i can ' t explain . . . everything was perfect . N - classic beef balls with mushroom gravy ( red risotto on the bottom ) N - spicy pork balls with spicy meat sauce N - chicken ball slider with parmesan cream sides simple salad mashed potatoes dessert caramel ice cream sandwich ( w brownie cookies ) - too sweet for my taste buds we need to go back to try the jambalaya balls . don ' t judge us . . . we love to eat
i have one word to describe the meal we enjoyed here- amazing ! ! ! if anyone ponders why french cuisine is so coveted- one trip to bibou will convince you . . . we were fortunate enough to taste the N prix fix sunday menu , which was well worth the price . you ' re given multiple options for appetizer , entree , and desert and everything we had was delicious . the menu changes frequently with some standbys but we enjoyed a chilled corn soup so creamy and delicious- i was basically licking the bowl clean escargots these chewy little snails were fantastic . they forego the traditional " drowning in butter and garlic sauce " for a sauce flavored with tarragon and fava beans ( snails have never tasted so good ! ) terrine i ' m not a big fan of terrine so that ' s all i ' ll say about that . . boeuf tender and perfectly cooked- to die for ! ! poulet yeah chicken is boring but i ' ve never made chicken this moist and delicious- its anything but boring here and the best part they had cherry clafoutis for dessert- one of my fave french desserts . . totally enjoyable meal- can ' t wait to go back ! ! 
i live in california , and it was an amazing surprise to find a korean restaurant around the block from my mom ' s house . walking in we were warmly welcomed by the two guys working behind the counter which was really nice . the food was incredibly tasty ! ever since i visited korea N years ago bimbimbap has been my favorite dish . the dish at pick and mix did not disapoint ! it was fun that you could also pick your toppings which i have never been able to do before . my brother got the bulgogi which was incredibly tasty as well and we shared a four piece of chicken wings ( with the hot-hot sauce ) which was delectfully crispy and tasty ( and hot ! ) another show of quality was the yummy kimchi which is always one of my signs of a quality restaurant . but what i am excited about is every time i go to visit my mom i ' ll be able to have quality korean food right next door to home ! 
great place , has take out , dining room in back , or outside patio . food is always excellent . pies are perfect , and the freshest salads around . try it and you will love it . 
worth the trip ! had a slice of chocolate swirl cheesecake . the cake was extremely rich yet deliciously light and very flavorful . loved every bite ! ! ! ! will be a fan for life ! 
i guess song can be hit or miss . the one thing that i love there is their massaman curry . it basically a coconut curry with chicken , potatoes and peanuts . my bf was very disappointed the last time he had it bc there weren ' t any peanuts in his curry . i like their calamari , but only bc they give the spicy lemony sauce . without the sauce , it pretty much doesn ' t taste like anything . the pad thai is hit or miss . sometimes it ' s good and sometimes there ' s too much fish sauce in it . i can tell , i ' m vietnamese . the one great thing about this place has to be their prices . so cheap ! ! i ' d go here again just bc it ' s decent food for the price . 
after a night out drinking in midtown new york , nothing is better than some halal chicken and rice . this infamous cart is discretely located on Nth and Nrd near a statue . what statue ? i absolutely don ' t remember ) the plate consist of pieces of flavorful chicken , orange colored rice , strips of lettuce , and bread that seems to look like naan smothered with special white sauce and spicy red sauce . the plates are decently priced around N-N dollars . great spot in the cuts , and they definitely pack on the meat . it was soo delicious , my friends and i ended grabbing another for lunch . p . s . the lamb and rice was great too ! 
my friend took me here for my birthday lunch on N N . the place is in a small and ancient space in the soho area of manhattan , with exposed beams in the ceiling and lots of brick and woodwork . the interior exudes an ambiance of rustic comfort , but it ' s the aroma of the food that comes out of the kitchen that hooks you immediately . i had the zuppa rustica ( soup ) and the pasta with wild boar sauce . the soup was very flavorful with hints of garlic in the broth , and the barley and vegetable were cooked , but not to the point of being mushy . the pasta was fresh , and the wild boar tasted exactly as it should have -- much more flavor and a slight gaminess that distinguishes it from pork like a good steak is to hamburger . these excellent dishes reminded me of the food i have had in the emilia-romagna area in italy , it was that good . the drinks ( limonata ) the waiter brought over to start with were a heavenly concoction of good vodka , mint , lemon and blood orange syrup -- truly divine ( i had N of them ) . it isn ' t often that you find an italian restaurant with the same quality of food that is found in italy -- this is one of those places . 
extremely disappointed . was trying to come here for brunch on a sunday morning at N N . got there and was turned away because they didn ' t open til N . 
good late night halal . hardly a banquet . 
went for sunday brunch for my father ' s birthday . it was very reasonably priced , the food was delicious the tables outside had an unbelievable view . why the three stars ? the wait staff . the hostess greated us pleasantly and with a smile that was the last smile we saw all meal . it was as if their job description prohibited smiling or pleasantries . surly and grossly inattentive . for example , N requests and N minutes for a coffee refill N requests and N for more milk for the coffee then double charging for the coffee . i did wonder if service was . like this because the brunch prices do not parallel the dinner prices . if i was at a diner i wouldnt care , but this type of service at a restaurant of this caliber ! ? ! ? 
a party of three of us visited the thirsty koala at N-N ditmars bloulevard on saturday , december N and feasted on the aussie preparations and being what we expected it to be and more . the service was above excellence , with the waiter attentive as one can be , as well as helpful so far as explaining the various dishes before , during and after we ordered . even the chef , katherine fuchs , whose father served as chef at the waldorf astoria paid a visit or two at our table inquiring wether everything was ok . the keftedakia being served here positively identify as an inspiration from the hellenic kitchen , and i must say the same about the herb-crusted lamb lollies , seasoned with fresh garlic , thyme , rosemary and extra virgin olive oil . how could such ingredients obscure the true greek identity of even veritable , australia-bred lamb chops ? this dish is served with caramelized pumpkin , but i opted for mashed sweet potatoes which i always relish . two delectable salads sprinkled with a goat ' s creamy white cheese , an overflowing platter of fried calamari and some absolutely delicious oysters rounded off the feast i partook that night . chef katherine was kind enough to give me the names of some of the exotic seasonings used in the variety of dishes , imported from australia and with an aussie name of bushtucker . the akudjura is bush tomato used in their chili from outback , while lemon myrtle is a rainforest herb used in the lemon myrtle rice served . watlleseed comes from the acacia plant and is used in their waffles served at breakfast and weekend brunch . in the dessert department , the lamington is very representative of what an aussies would delight in , as is the triple t- a fabulous tiramisu , which unfortunately they had run out of that night . don ' t miss visiting the thirsty koala . you ' ll be missing an experience . 
wow so many bad reviews i love this place whenever i go back to ct i try to go there to eat . seafood combo my fav ! ! ! 
my go to for a quick bite- N for N . N is my go to ! when i don ' t have time to sit for fang this is a must go ! 
i was debating whether or not to try this place , or go to a restaurant we ' ve already been to , for my birthday this year . we decided to come here to try something new and i am so glad we did ! it is a very cute restaurant , small but cozy . when we walked in , there was a old man playing some sort of wooden wind instrument , setting the tone immediately . the food was amazing . we ordered pad thai , drunken noodles , and the lettuce wraps , which all tasted so good . they also had nice cold sweet tea . when we were walking back to the car , we noticed a small garden of herbs , which means that all of their seasonings was fresh ! i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for delicious thai food in a new and fun environment ! 
i wish i could give this place N stars for the pizza ( delicious ! ) and N stars for the beer . we got two pizzas sausage and hot pepper and white pizza with spinach mushrooms and onion , which were great . N N of the beers we got were pretty terrible . do not get the toasted blonde . i don ' t think it was skunked , but it tasted that way . the stout also tasted kind of flat , like it needed more flavors . the brown was pretty tasty . also , delicious olives in the martini i ordered to wash away the taste of the first beer i ordered . 
great to place to hang out , especially during warm months due to their outdoor seating area . the selection of beer is good , and the food is okay as well . the most interesting thing about this place is ambiance . it is a great place for a date . 
what i love is to see that they are always tweaking and playing to make familiar standards just a little bit better , a little bit more interesting . take the sangria-like tangerine , spiced wine and basil coconut granita " pre-dessert " . still the same basic flavor profile , but kicked up a notch this time with the addition of pop rocks that did not disrupt the essence of the course , but took it to another level by adding a whole new sensory experience while savoring the same winning flavor combination ! a few new revisions to the N course the sardines and tripe are gone , and in come a goat meatball with cuttle fish over an olive reduction and parsley oil , plus a razor clam appetizer adorned with foam of the same . i was happy to see several of my favourites still part of the tasting in particular , the monkfish liver in bonito sauce , wagyu beef " cheesesteak " , serrano ham croquette , and the the simple yet mouth-wateringly decadent caramelized torrija . the hearts of palm salad is still there , and although i consider it an artful and well thought out piece that contrasts and plays out nicely on the palate , i would have been happy to see it move on and replaced with something else . ditto for the ( older ) cuttle fish dish . 
amazing ! just a tip you have to make a reservation well in advance
i had heard good things about the place , but when i went there with three friends i was actually quite disappointed . three of us ordered the mediterranean breakfast , which consisted of two eggs ( any style ) , and very small amounts of avocado , pita bread and salad . it was supposed to come with labne , which is a mediterranean yoghurt sauce , but i ' m pretty sure what we get was just sour cream . the food was not bad , but certainly not special - and too expensive for the quality and quantity . the coffee was watery , and the waiters were kind , but not very adequate in refilling water glasses and coffee cups - even when we asked for it . 
the food is bad the service is bad , it ' s a very dirty , the food was raw or over cooked , the salad was oily its stinks and the only two things worth getting are the shrimp and french fries . the benches are falling apart . it is not worth going to . 
this is the place to go for steak . . you will not be disappointed
what a strange divy throw back . it seriously looks like this place is trapped in another decade . but , that is what makes it way cool . and where the hell else in the city can you get N franziskaner ? nowhere . the locals are strange , but endearingly so ( they actually try to talk with you ) i came here on an evening when a friend was playing a set of music . the ballroom in the rear looks like he it hasn ' t been worked on since the N ' s and the lighting is atrocious . so , these combined with the strange but friendly locals makes this place a worthy haunt . if i ' m in ridgewood i ' ll be coming back . 
first time i tried coming to ippudo , it was a N-hour wait so i took a pass on that noise . this time we were told the wait would be N N N-N hours , and we weren ' t starving at the moment , so we decided to wait it out . there were quite a few out of towners with us , so why not take them here ? after an hour of walking around the neighborhood , we went back and actually got seated within N minutes ! upon entering we were greeted quite loudly and cheerfully by the workers , who seemed to actually enjoy their jobs , unlike some more sour restaurant staff i ' ve encountered . what really impressed me about the wait staff is that they came over and poured our beer from the pitcher for us . i haven ' t been to another restaurant that did this , so i was pretty surprised . not sure if it ' s because i don ' t go to enough fancy-ish places or i ' m easily impressed . . . onto the food , it was just ok for me . i had a bite of the pork buns and i ordered the amaraku modern ramen . my coworker and her bf hyped up the pork buns a lot , and though they were good , they just were not as good as i would ' ve hoped . they did have a bit of a spicy kick to them that was done well . the ramen was alright , a bit too salty for my taste and there were only N slices of meat . yeah , ramen isn ' t about the meat , but jeez , a third slice won ' t kill me ! i would ' ve rather headed to chinatown and grabbed a noodle soup for less than N . the ramen certainly wasn ' t worth the N and wait . the atmosphere is pretty rowdy with a lot of shouting in japanese by the workers , loud music playing , and dim lighting . the bathroom is tiny though ! i opened the door and practically hit another person while they were handling their business , super awkward ! i also had to lean into the sink to let him past me and it was really wet with water dripping off the edge . definitely need to maintain it better . 
if it wasn ' t for food network ' s the best thing i ' ve ever ate , i wouldn ' t have tried osteria , not because i don ' t like italian food or i " don ' t like to try new things " , but the location of osteria is in a section of town with little else around . the section of broad street immediately north of city hall seemed a bit ran down and deserted , it ' s a blank space between the more vibrant chinatown and art museum areas . it ' s my very first time there and the first issue i encounter is parking , there ' s no sign telling whether the adjacent condo parking is also used for the restaurant , so me and my friend drove around the area looking for a spot in the already high saturated area with the auto repair shop , the church and the school . but once we found a spot and walked the three blocks , circulating the building looking for the entrance , osteria turned out to be quite the promising place . osteria is only opened for lunch on thursday and friday and we picked a glorious day to visit . at first we were seated inside , but after a while i made a troublesome request to change into the cocooned outside area and got my wish pleasantly granted . the interior design is decidedly going for a slightly industrial rustic route , i especially like the wall composed with wood wine boxes . between the two of us , we split an order of lombarda and the yelp-reviewers recommended chicken liver rigatoni . originally , i had my heart set on another reviewer recommended choice which is the pig ' s head pizza , but the waiter informed me that it was seasonal . the lombarda turned out pretty good , i have longed to try a pizza with an egg in the middle , but was naive enough to think i can create such a thing at home . i didn ' t know that my standard oven can ' t compete with a brick fire oven . i ' m a big fan of raw egg yolk with bread . the crust was thin and crunchy , the bitto cheese gave it a certain bite ( pun unintended ) , and the cotechino sausage is slightly sweet with the egg to smooth it all out . not quite the best thing i ' ve ever ate , but it was generally pleasant . the chicken liver rigatoni was great . al dente rigatoni in bits of liver sweetened by melted cipolline onions . the sauteed liver is soft and melts in your mouth . the pasta absorbed the flavor of the combination as well as sage and cheese turns it into one luscious dish . the price is a bit on the higher end , but with superb service and comfortable space , i ' m looking forward to find an excuse to come back and try the other pastas and the antipasti . 
i feel fortunate to have a restaurant like the spot in my neighborhood . not only is the food delicious , interesting , and consistent , but their staff is competent and wonderful and the price is right . i frequent the spot with my Nyo son and he loves it - the giant aquarium is a crowd pleaser , as is the relaxed , surf-inspired decor and vibe . the have ample seating outside in the warmer months , and although the only frontage they have butts up against busy shelburne rd . , it ' s still nice to have the option to dine outside when the weather permits . i can honestly say i ' ve never had a bad meal there , and i hope they continue in their awesome groove for years to come . 
great food , good sports bar atmosphere . lots of flat screen tvs playing practically every game on . nice lunch hour escape from parsippany . 
to say pub N is my guilty pleasure is quite the understatement . it ' s a spectacle , it ' s a debacle , it ' s a feast for the eyes . what exactly may you see here ? well , you may see some girl furiously grindin ' on a guy , lap dance style , to the point you ' d think you stumbled into someone else ' s champagne room session . you may see drunk dudes stealing from the clueless shot girls while their buddy plays decoy flirt . you may see pre-stripper debuts atop the bar . you may see high levels of pda . you may see gravity-defying plastic surgery cleavage . you may see gravity-stricken natural cleavage . ok , you ' re definitely gonna see lots of cleavage . but , most importantly , you will certainly see patrons having a good-ass time . pub N doesn ' t exactly do too much to counter the jersey stereotype . if anything , it enforces it ten-fold . but , with the right mindset , this place is a blast . there are two bars , upbeat music with corresponding videos on the tvs , a packed make-shift dance floor complete with fog machine , and an outdoor patio for the smokers . this is the type of joint where bad decisions are made . it ' s also a guaranteed hangover thanks to cheap drinks . regret rarely kicks in until the morning after anyway . pub N is true to its word . open till Nam . never a cover . always an experience . 
absolutely yummy . really excellent food in a very cute and relaxing atmosphere . the restaurant is quite small , but it doesn ' t feel cramped . they really know how to maximize the space . i was craving moules frites and my friend was craving steak frites . he was very satisfied , and so was i . i recommend the parissienne flavor - saffron and mustard cream , a bit rich , very flavorful . not shy at all on the saffron . the mussels were plentiful and perfectly cooked . the frites , as other reviewers have mentioned , are deee-vine . seriously . i was very full from the mussels , but i had to finish my frites . they were so delicious . i usually use those little friend potatoes to pick up the leftover juices of the mussels , but no no , i didn ' t want to mess with the crispy goodness . they were perfect . note i ' ve been before for their brunch special ( N for a beverage and entree ) . not too shabby . 
ah . . . pho as close to home as i can get them . back then my mother would make pho every month , she would cook as if she was feeding a army ( literally ) , but sadly she would make it once every N-N months now . luckily , thanh da is a walk away ! whew ! the noodle is broader than what i ' m use to but it ' s okay . they are pretty generous on the meats . the soup base is bursting with flavor and msg ( it ' s not necessary a good thing but yes msg , that ' s how it is in asia , so get over it ) . . . thanh da ' s pho is pretty darn good but mom ' s is always better . side note i really don ' t think their sandwich is that good , the bread is always soft when i order it . inside is pretty hallow and very light in ingredients . it takes longer to make a banh mi than to get a bowl of pho ! want a satifying banh mi ? head over to ba xuyen . want pho that ' s good for the soul and flu ? stay here ! 
great romantic place . its my first time to experience this kind of service . you must come and see it . . 
this was our second visit to meal and it was as good as our first . we both got the slow cooked braised short ribs which were outstanding . full of flavor and fork ready tender . our appetizers of foie gras and thai style calamari were equally as good . our desserts of apple crisp and fried banana was a perfect finish to an excellent meal . our serving team of steven and lauren was also outstanding , attentive and professional . meal is becoming one of our favorite restaurants and we look forward to coming back soon . 
pretentious , over priced , horrible service , and not kid friendly at all . i first entered with my N year old . we were told we couldn ' t bring the stroller inside . ok , fine , it was left outside . waited for N-N minutes at the table . nobody came or asked us for our order . my wife joined us with our N month old during this wait , and finally we had to ask the owner if we could order something . he said sure , walked away from us to the table next to us ( who were seated long after us ) , and asked them if they ' d like to order and started taking their order ! at that point we picked up and left . just plain rude ! get some high chairs , and treat your patrons like guests ! 
N dumplings for N . N , need i say more ? the dumplings are always fried to perfection , never ever too crispy . sesame pancake with beef is super filling and it ' s only N . N . seriously , everything here is like under N . N . you really can ' t go wrong with whatever you order . the soups are pretty good as well , a little better than your average take out place but not really something i have often in general . only bad thing is that this place is super cramped but it ' s not really a place to stay and eat . 
hey ! ! somehow all my reviews got deleted . balthazar was my first one . i just reviewed per se and my review are gone ! ! ! ( i ' ll do it again because i love you guys ! ! ! ! balthazar is still my fav even though people say it is past its prime . i love it here . the really like the dark wood and big mirrors . the food is always delicious . the staff is always so sweet , but i am also there a lot so they know me by now . i recommend the steak tartar appetizers , french onion soup , duh ! , and can ' t go wrong with the steak frites ! if you are in soho it is balthazar ! ha . 
thank you , thank you , thank you , yelp , for introducing me to wafa ' s . i would never have found this jewel without you . even with all the reviews , i was a bit surprised to find out that wafa ' s is literally a one-woman show . there ' s a kitchen , a display case of food separating the kitchen from the dining area , and then maybe N tables and a N-person bar . this place is tiny , but i would never call it a hole-in-a-wall , because it is just too clean and airy and homey to feel like one . as other yelpers have said , eating here is really like visiting your mother ' s kitchen . and wafa treats you like she ' s your mom . now , we did have to wait about N minutes for our shawermas , but that ' s because we came in right after N groups placed their orders , and also because wafa literally started cooking our meat and chopping the tomatoes for our sandwiches at the moment she began prepping our meal . how much fresher can you get ? the chicken was savory and well-seasoned , and the lamb was spicy . we got tons of veggies in our thin but not-too-thin pita wraps , and the sandwiches were huge . the baklava is out of this world , just very light and flaky and not too sweet . perfect , perfect dessert . while we ate , more groups of people came by and ordered , standing around patiently waiting for wafa to cook everything . it is that good . i can ' t wait to come back and try the platters and the falafel and everything else on the menu . 
my husband and i recently went to zafra ' s and had a spectacular meal . the drinks were delicious , the apps were unique and tastey , and our dinners were mouth-watering ! of course we saved room for dessert , and it was the perfect ending to the perfect night . i highly recommend zafra ' s ! if you weren ' t impressed the first time , you should definitely give it a second chance ! 
it ' s cliche , but true . " first time , long time . " i ' m a long time yelp user , but this is my first review , and with good reason . i ' ve been to pyt N times now , and all N times i have received sub-par service and average food . but it wasn ' t until tonight when the owner , tommy up banned me from his restaurant via twitter for voicing an opinion , was i finally pushed over the edge to write this review . the adult milkshakes are hit or miss . when they ' re made correctly , they ' re definitely delicious , but since they don ' t always come out correctly , you ' re taking a gamble every time you order one . my boyfriend and i ordered two adult milkshakes and received one with zero alcohol and one with way more alcohol than it should have had - and were told by the staff that we were wrong when we pointed out the mistake . the burgers are good , and tommy up does get very creative with his burger of the week . having a weekly burger is impressive , and i do hope to see him keep up with that pace and the level of creativity that has been going into them . i haven ' t tasted them all , but the few that i have tasted so far have been worth the trip out to nolibs . unfortunately , no burger is worth a N minute wait , especially when i can get an equally good burger pretty much anywhere else in the city in half the time . every time i ' ve gone to pyt i ' ve waited over N minutes for my food . whether i ordered a burger of the week or a regular menu item , this excessive wait time held true . i ' m typically a very positive person and i don ' t really like knock things , and until tonight , i was very happy to continue going to pyt , despite its few flaws . however , after voicing an opinion of mine on twitter and being told by tommy up that i was banned from his restaurant , i felt that something needed to be said . i was already unsatisfied , but now i ' m very much so . even if you disagree with your customers opinions , it is not in your best interest to treat your customers the way i was treated tonight . especially not in times where the opinions of your customers can be shared with the entire internet in a matter of minutes . will my unfortunate situation with this establishment stop people from going there ? probably not , but that ' s not the point . the point is just to get the word out there . that is what yelp is for , right ? 
loved the wine flight ! this place was great for a night to catch up with a friend . i docked a star because the servers were so beyond busy stressed that the service wasn ' t too great . they didn ' t even let us pick all of our wines in the flight because they were " too busy . " however , i can ' t complain too much because they gave us the happy hour price past happy hour . i also visited the location in san francisco and it was absolutely delightful ( almost identical in appearance ) . i will return . . . oh , and get the honey goat cheese ball . . . delish ! 
i was in the mood for a nice quiet dinner to end a long week . i hadn ' t eaten here in many years and when this was suggested i thought i would give it a try . we sat upstairs at a table near the bar which has a cozy feel . it turned out to be a great evening . . . good food , good music and good atmosphere . 
ghetto ! we arrived to the store , ready to place our order and the person taking the orders started to talk in great lenghts about different topics , eventually my sister randomly just burted out our order and then it was processed . the worst part was when it was time to pay . there were two cashiers on one register , then one just walked away . i asked the other girl the price of a bag a chips and she said " i dont know , you have to wait for the other cashier to return , she went to get a hair net " . we waited another N N minutes before can pay for the food . the food is good but definitely overpriced ! ! ! ! 
went saturday N Npm , no reservations . they told us N mins wait . we signed-up on the waiting list and went for a walk , not sure whether we ' d come back . nice walk to the pier and they called us taht they had a table ready within N mins of signing-up . the place is smallish , cute , resembling an old argentinean almac n . the ambient is loud , warm . we started off with some empanadas ( meat and corn and spinach ) , which were very good . then we had entra a ( skirt steak ) , asado de tira ( short rib ) and milanesa de pollo ( chicken milanese ) . finished with dulce de leche and banana caramelized pancake and chocolate fondant . all was very good and prices are affordable ( i guess this is a relative term ) . still no wines , but they do allow byob contrary to what i had read prior to going , or i would have taken some wine . there is a liquor store N- N blocks , on Nth i believe . bottom line highly recommended , won ' t be disappointed , take your wine and enjoy the food ! 
love your bubble tea sandwiches ! 
public is my go to restaurant . always a great welcome at the door , wine advice is beyond , and space and crowd is cool without being pretentious . this says a lot for nolita and it likely means they are doing something worthwhile . now- for the food all dishes were perfectly seasoned , and if you have never had an " herby lentil salad " drop what you are doing and go to this restaurant and eat it , now . scallops are like no scallops i have ever had . how do they make the sauce for these ? sweet and savory . all fish dishes i have tried are out of this world . i stick to the fish because i need to go light to save room for what is likely the yummiest desserts in town . they change , but the hokey pokey ice cream is a must have , always , 
warning ! ! ! ! extremely rude staff ! can ' t understand how this restaurant could survive in a service industry . horrible , horrible place . i was warned by others but never expected their experience could be the standard level of service . boy was i wrong ! stay clear of this place , there are so many good quality restaurants with gracious staff in this area why go some place where they are so mean ? i wish i didn ' t even have to give this place one star to be able to post this . 
i went to eat at this place with my friend because i was dying to try it but i couldn ' t regret it more . . . . it took ten minutes for us to get a menu we raised our hands a couple of time and the hostess who was in front of us kept ignoring us . . . when we finally got the menu , it took half hour to get a margarita and a coke ? seriously i can understand the food taking long but a coke ? ? ? ? . . . . then an N min later when we finally got our food it was good i can ' t complain about the food . . . but the manager personally went and asked every table how everything was except to us ? i wonder why ? he gave water to the people behind me and even though my glass was empty he didn ' t bother even asking . . . . . i don ' t want to say we were treated bad because we were the only hispanics there in that room but i can ' t find an explanation for it because my money is worth the same as everybody elses . . . . . . won ' t be going back there . . . . . . . . . 
an amazing place to eat . the steak on a stone is delicious . . . and you get to cook it yourself with garlic butter in front of you ! the price is amazing too . i have been here twice now but would go more if i didn ' t live N minutes away . just make sure the valet doesn ' t park your car by the outside grill they use for kitchen overflow on busy nights . my car was covered in grease ( 
awesome german food and drink . i love the organic chicken breast and authentic german salad , and their meat and cheese plates are second to none when you ' re comparing german restaurants . also they have lindemans framboise lambic ( my absolute favorite ) and a large list of beers on tap . a great alternative for frankford hall in the winter when you want to drink a gigantic beer and dont feel like freezing outside also a good alternative for fh in the middle of the summer when it ' s too hot to enjoy drinking outdoors . a really fun place to watch soccer ! 
great food and service . expensive but good for business dinner or special occasion . 
very cute place and the food was okay as well . it was a bit pricey for me , but thank god for groupon ! 
manjares , it is an ok place . i guess i was more dissappointed when me and my husband found a hair in our dish . i did not say anything because i went with other people and did not want to ruin their night . the tapa seafood they served us was not that good and the smell was very strong which it is a sign right there that the fish is not fresh at all . the service is ok . the dishes are not spanish from spain as she claims , the owner is from some place in the caribbean and have a little or not knowledge of spanish dishes . there is a place in new haven , ct to go if you want to get real spanish food and the owner is originally from galicia , spain . he owns two restaurans and he really knows what he is doing . 
consistently great experiences ! great food , friendly staff , excellent location . . . check , check , check ! we have been coming here for years . . . it ' s a go-to spot . i usually get a medium dallas burger with sweet potato fries ( it comes with the most amazing honey mustard horseradish sauce ) . hubs always switches his order up and even gets the turkey burgers . we are huge fans and love this place . 
my family discovered this diner about a year ago , and it ' s one of the best in the area . lately i noticed that depending on what you order ( specialties ) the food remains consistent and excels expectations , however some of the diner staples ( grill items ) seemed a little inconsistent to me these last N months . the staff is nice and do their best to please , so they get extra points for customer service . 
everyone chill out . my boyfriend tipped me off to some of the bad reviews for this place , and i feel obligated to defend my fellow south williamsburg neighbor . some of the complaints about service are ridiculous - you ' re really offended that you got called out for eating your bag of chips you bought at the deli in a restaurant ? ! you were surprised that a place that states on its menu about time restrictions for certain hours would dare to follow thru and ask you to adhere to them ? ! honestly though , i feel like i ' m preaching to those who aren ' t worth saving . don ' t go back . i don ' t want to sit next to you . moto makes great , cheap food ( no microwave to speak of bobby s . ) and has one of the most creative interiors anywhere in brooklyn . 
food is decent , unfortunately overshadowed by the atmosphere . great spot for people watching . prices are steep for what you get in return . cheese plate was yummy , drinks from the bar not so much . 
owner was a legend and extremely knowledgeable about beer and other important life matters . made us feel like locals even though we were from the other side of the world . food was delicious and stupidly cheap . 
this place is wonderful . i go here only for the ceviche , i think this is the best ceviche in the tri state area hands down . choros a la chalaca is great , as well as the jalea . i recommend this place , i drive N min to come here . 
i ' ve only been here for brunch , but i loved every bite . definitely try the halumi eggs . 
excellent food and great service . all servers took extremely good care of us in a very genuine way . would definitely recommend . also , my wife is gluten-intolerant and they catered for it extremely well . not only does the menu have heaps of gluten-free dishes , but they made sure every they told us each dish was gluten-free when they brought it back out . thanks ! just a quick note - they were booked out when we went ( sat night ) so recommend you call ahead . 
food is always amazing . you can make a meal out of the appetizers . whenever i walk by beyoglu , the line has been out the door-really better to go at off peak times . can get very loud but always worth the noise . 
i came here for brunch on a saturday at Npm . it was busy , but there were still open tables and we did not have to wait ( for a table of N ) . service was fast and friendly , nothing that wow ' d ( but i didn ' t expect a lot out of a cheap brunch ) . they had a lot of drink specials ( N bloody marys , etc ) . i had the french toast which was really tasty , and my boyfriend had the pancakes . they were a little heavy ( and dry ) . nice spot , outside seating is prime , glad i came , but i likely wouldn ' t come back . 
this is my new favorite place ! ! ! last night it was my Nth or Nth time there and it keeps getting better . a very diverse small , sexy and cozy hideout right in the village . . . the drinks are amazing and a for creativity . the food is fresh , tasty and delicious . the ambiance is fun with different music from N ' s , N ' s and nice current artist . you can write your own confession on the walls of this place or read someone else ' s , anyway you are bound to stomp on few funny one that make the place warm and fun . the most important part though , is the people that work there . they make sure to welcome you and assist you as soon as possible . erika , the owner is a delight of a person and makes this place a unique one with her vision . my friends and i were impressed by how low key they are and how they ensure you are having a great time , even if is closing time , oops ! ( just once ! ) this place is perfect to go for drinks , or dinner , alone , as a couple , or in a group . i can ' t wait to try the winter menu , they told me they have some nice surprises . can ' t wait to go there again and continue trying their sexy and funny drinks . my favorite so far is the love affair and devil ' s advocate ) 
this will be my go-to comfort restaurant . the pork buns are addictive and the shishito peppers were as good as the ones at serrano in vegas ! everything is super fresh and made to order . service was attentive and knowledgeable . very reasonable prices . ani ramen is a great reason to forego the typical church street establishments and venture down bloomfield avenue ! 
ask me how the food was . i don ' t know i was refused service , an i was not given any specific reason why . i am a chef for a catering company , and food is my passion . on my free days i love trying new and different restaurants , but i will tell you , the ignorance and bigotry that was directed towards me at this place was staggering . please do not patronize a place like this
its really in between N and N stars . the famous blue berry pancakes are good , but have had better with fresh fruit . the pictures on yelp so appealing that the food was aliitle bit of a let down . . its all good , but not worth an hour wait . i think the eggs bacon cheese with tomatoe jam were more interesting but would go when there isn ' t a line . 
one wiz wit . . . it ' s that simple . this place is a philly legend . if you ' re just passing thru be sure to check geno ' s out ! 
drunk after hot chip show at " music hall of williamsburg " on sixth . want food . get a spinach pie , shwarma . they are totally disgusting . ugh . not worth the money . also , became engaged in the most hipsteresque pretentious band conversation ever experienced , it went something like this dude N " oh you were at the hot chip show , i saw them two years ago when they played some small tiny bar it was sooooo great this show was good but doesnt even compare " dude N " oh yeah well when i saw them at they played and it was amazing . this show was good too , i guess . i mean i ' m just happy i got tickets since it sold out so fast . blech to the food , price , atmosphere , and crowd . 
great new addition to the neighborhood , very nice ambiance and decor . it has a great chill vibe and the staff is friendly . came here for dinner when they opened and the food was fantastic ! especially the kale salad and the fried clams . the portions are not that big so plan to order an app and main course if you ' re hungry . 
great breads , foccacias , and sfoglatelle . second only to calandras . the lunch counter is great . the service can be rude at times , but it doesnt stop me from buying here . 
a word of warning whoever eats here for some reason the hostess even with a reservation will look you up and down and try to shove you into the bar for eating stand your ground and do not let her talk you into it . the next step she will attempt to shove you into a cheesey seat behind the stewards galley this is were the dirty dishes are stored . next the blond pony-tailed hostess will make a comment on people who " park and bark at a table . after looking this up the translation of this mean sitting your but down on taking a long time to eat . my opinion is this place is way over estimated to be given such praise , please don ' t waste your money and spread the news on this terrible restaurant . 
i was going to give N stars before lunch menu . . i do love ramen . . i do love noodle , but sobaya ' s soba and udon didn ' t give me any impression . . wait ! did i just say i didn ' t like my foods here ? oh , nooooo ! then , let me tell you about their lunch box option ! first , it ' s huge ! yup ! the portion is huge ! N bento box soba or udon ( cold hot ) N desert bae bul leur ( full ) second , it ' s huge ! yup ! their service is friendly huge with smile ! third , it ' s huge ! yup ! the price is huge ! N for lunch ? that ' s steep . . but , you will get huge belly huge satisfaction ! oh oh ! like other japaneses restaurants , there ' s another huge gift for ladies . . yup ! bidet ! 
food is amazing potions are excellent prices are reasonable and service is great ! i love this restaurant ! ! ! 
went with the girl to eat pizza in little italy service sat down for N min still havent gotten a waiter to place my order . she was rude and slooowwwwwww ! N N food we ordered half meatball and italian sausage pizza . it was huge and fresh . their ingredient impressed me . the price for the pizza was worth it . N N atmosphere- typical family small italian restaurant . they took us through the kitchen pass the dishwashers to another area of seating . the entire place - smelled like delicious pizza N N overall - great pizza- i will come back again but they really need to fire some waiters and hire and train the new ones better . 
great little bar that pops out of nowhere in crown height ' s bedford ave . can ' t speak to the food , but went instead for drinks at a bday gathering instead of dinner and got there a little past nine . it was packed with parties noshing away on what seemed like delish plates of food . nice large bar area with attentive bartenders . nice selection of beers on draft as well as wine on draft ! woo ! dark , low lighting adds to the atmosphere . definitely more restaurant than bar , but if you get the back space area , a small group should be fine . looks like they have a pretty outdoors area too , but we weren ' t allowed to venture out . two cons is that it can get very very hot in heeeerrrrre ( dress accordingly ) and the food odors ( which aren ' t bad ) permeate the place . so be forewarned . will be back to sample the nosh ! 
salty . . . . ordered the carbonara - so salty it was inedible . sent it back for the spaghetti vongole - salty again ! there is no reason why a pasta dish should be salty . i get that the guanciale can be salty but not to the point where the dish is inedible . and what about the vongole ? no excuse ! im not picky when it comes to food and i have never sent a plate back in my life . i took clients here for dinner based off the majority of good reviews and i am shocked ! most certainly not worthy of a N star review . i have to say in my many years of relying on yelp the is the first time i have been disappointed . i would have went with N star but the sommelier was excellent and very knowledgeable . will not go back or recommend maialino . 
absolutely love the friendly and neighborhood-iness of the farm on adderly . best burger desserts in town . not to mention the delicious fries with curry mayo ! 
the baba ghanoush is great ! the baklava is amazing . . . its firmness , syrupy wet walnutty goodness , is a must ! also the best thing about this place is that everything is homemade and fresh . 
great little spot . wouldn " t recommend for a large group , but killer for an intimate meal . juicy pork chop , great soft shell crab and a great wine selection to boot . highly recommend . 
cafe gitane has become one of my regular date restaurants , whether it ' s a fun date with my cousin or a place to take my boyfriend to . the food is exquisite . i love the hibiscus tea , avocado toast , vegetarian cous cous . portions are perfect and the restaurant is cute , if a bit small . there can sometimes be a wait , but it has never been too long for me . also , there are magazines along the wall to amuse yourself if you are waiting for someone . the bathroom is tiny , but cute as well . the waitstaff is also , cute , but nice and can be quick with you ( it is very busy ! ) 
a decent diner . however , it ' s not open N hours like typical diners in the area are . the price of food is a bit pricey for diner food , especially considering its location . the service here is average , nothing overly great , but usually not too bad . 
i love this place . best ramen in nyc ! 
i have loved this place since first visit . the food is amazing . i love the unique pairings , they amplify the flavor of each dish . i first tried the popular lobster roll , and i loved it ! since then i ' ve been bouncing around the menu trying different things . there hasn ' t been anything i haven ' t liked- actually , i love it all . i definitely recommend coming here and trying something new . great quality delicious food ! ! 
mookcake foods is a pretty cute place in a conveniently located and nice part of the city . at first , it seems like a slightly shined-up diner , but a look at the menu belies a selection superior to your average dirty spoon . there are a lot of tasty selections , and the prices are very low . i got a beef shin sandwich that cost me N . N . the sandwich was really served more like a fajita the beef was on the plate next to a pile of watercress and two tortillas accompanied it . the shin was extremely tender and flavorful . my dining companion got the salmon , which looked to be cooked very well and was also a good value . mooncake foods is a great place for basic , thoughtful dishes at a good value . definitely recommended . 
this place is so tacky . i walked into this restaurant earlier this week and presented the manager with a N for N coupon from entertainment . com . the coupon allowed me to purchase one meal ( up to N ) and get another meal free . the manager told me the coupon was for dine-in only . i was ok with that . i ordered a sandwich . after i finished eating the sandwich , the manager walked up and told me i was not getting a Nnd sandwich because the coupon was for full meals only , not sandwiches . he said i forgot to read the fine print . after i payed for the sandwich , he handed the coupon back and told me to use it next time . trust me , there isn ' t going to be a next time . 
simplistic yet effective . their business model keeps them packed and there ' s a reason - the food is worth the wait . there ' s no hype here , if you can look past the ominous line on weekends and are willing to put up with imperfect service , your taste buds are sure to be rewarded . they host an assortment of frittatas and usually have a good slew of specials each weekend . their glory cakes are a good staple but their weekend special glory cakes are typically better . they have monkey bread french toast which is mind blowingly sweet , truculent to the point of additive . they have good eggs and potatoes , homemade ketchup that ' s tasty but their biscuits . . . . oh my god . the biscuits get their own paragraph . they are thick , dry and crumbly . what you do to make them awesome is pour some of their homemade jam or ask for honey on them and they get super delicious . you can ' t go wrong with these things as a dessert after devouring a plate of eggs and fries . fresh squeezed juice , yummy muffins , fresh desserts - it ' s all great . here is the one bummer , their coffee , which is served in coleman stove camping mugs , it ' s yucky . i love coffee with breakfast but i ' ll generally have my fill at morning glory then walk to chapterhouse for the coffee . sorry guys , it sucks . the service is very hit and miss and weekend waits are rough so if you want to beat the wait , i ' d get there about N N . 
wow ! went into murphy ' s on a late saturday afternoon expecting a crowded college bar atmosphere with standard pub food . very surprised . this was the most inspired menu that i have seen in the hanover lebanon region in awhile . great service , great beer selection and a fabulous locally sourced menu . lobster kale salad with butternut squash goat cheese , curried chick peas with falafel , pork dumplings , and the egg , sausage caramelized onion brunch sandwich all delicious and well seasoned . 
thank you matt marie for outstanding food and service . we are exciting to have your business in ourarea . the food is fresh and always delivered on time . your staff ' s desire to meet the customers needs is very refreshing . we look forward to our next lunch with you . renee
this place is good , but waaay overrated . there are better meatball subs in little italy . maybe not a lamb feta meatball sub , but the " special " meatballs tend to be a bit disappointing anyway . the wait is almost always too long to be worth it , and the meatballs are hit and miss i ' ve been a couple times when my meatballs were really really dry , and if it wasn ' t after midnight , i doubt i would ' ve eaten them . 
if you are coming to visit the city and looking for a good cheesesteak . . . . this is not your spot . if you want some food after clubbing or being out all night . . . this is still really not your spot , but it does satisfy if you are drunk and hungry . a plus that some might like is that the meat is very thick . it ' s not thinly sliced like most cheesesteak places around the area . you know you are getting beef ! but it is soooo greasy ! prepare to go home with a heart attack once you are finished ! lol geno ' s is a very fast pace spot . you must know what you want upon getting to the window . there ' s really no asking questions or anything like that . it ' s pick your cheese then wit or witout . done ! ! oh , and they are pretty expensive too . i don ' t think they are really worth it ! 
i had such high hopes but was disappointed twice . my first visit was ok , waited for a table , the place was very busy . i ordered a salad and the miso salmon . the salad was bland to say the least , the salmon was over cooked and the rice it was on was crunchy on the edges , i think it sat under the heat lamp too long . waitress was extremely friendly . i figured it was a new restaurant they would get it together . second trip was worse , went for lunch on a saturday and had chris as a waiter . the diva of a waiter was not only obnoxious but horrible at his job . when questioned about an item on the menu his response " i don ' t even know what your talking about " . the tuna melt was weak at best , a few pieces of shredded cheese , not slices , with cold tuna in the middle and a few peppers . asked for the check N times and my mom was never given her take out , after waiting so long we gave up on the take out and left . i don ' t think i am brave enough to try it a third time . wish them luck but it will be tough to keep a restaurant going with mediocre food and bad staff . 
it ' s not easy to add something new after N reviews , but here ' s my attempt happy hours on saturday always make me happy . this is a good one , particularly for the food . the dumplings are incredibly light , smooth , and i could bath in the broth . i was stunned that they could get the kobe sliders a perfect pittsburgh rare , and the pork bao buns were quite tasty . the food comes out fast and in no particular order , but i enjoyed that . note to the wise , do not leave here without trying the brussel sprouts . the drink specials are good , but they could use a little more variety on the hh cocktail menu . atmosphere is unique and bold , but somehow maintains an intimate feel . we ' ll definitely be back to visit the sassy bartenders . . . quite the gaggle . 
i was so excited to try this place out . i went originally a few weeks ago around N N , i believe , and was told the wait was about N minutes to an hour for N people . both i and my friend were starving so that was not an option . a few weeks later i was determined to be there early , because i was sure the wait was due to the unseasonably warm day during the winter . boy was i wrong . the place opens at N and and i arrived at N N to a N to N minute wait , and yes it was the tail end of that window that i received a call saying a table was now available . i was really looking forward to trying the cheddar waffles and was in the mood for scrambled eggs and hash browns . i ordered the scrambled eggs and asked for a substitution of the waffle for the toast . my food came out pretty quickly but to my dismay it was not all i had hoped . the potions were tiny . thank god i went to a cafe down the block before hand and had hot chocolate and a muffin during my N minute wait otherwise i would have been starving . now let ' s talk about that food . so my waffle substitution was a quarter of a waffle . i repeat a quarter of the waffle instead of toast , which was a dry as the sahara . the fact that the syrup never made it to the table didn ' t help . the hash browns were actually a hash brown ( singular ) that was guaranteed to raise your blood pressure because it was so salty . i also ordered an apple juice which was N bucks but practically came in a shot glass . this meal was so not worth the wait or anticipation . our server was not memorable at all . i think due to all the hype about this place everyone just focuses on getting people in and out as soon as possible . they weren ' t rude but the atmosphere was not welcoming in this place . i can ' t envision having one of N hour brunch dates in this place . will certainly not go back again . 
we have been a fan since they opened and were saddened to see them closed for N months during the christmas season . we tried our luck again last night to find out they have returned ! ! the duck is the most flavorful duck i have ever enjoyed ( and i order duck wherever and whenever on a menu ) . the atmosphere was as relaxing as a spa and our server , jessica i believe , was as friendly and on point as they come ! we will continue to be devoted guests of blu ! 
the capocinnos is great . beautiful woodworking creates a relaxed atomshere . the owner is a great guy ! 
i came in here randomly looking for somewhere to eat something decent so i check the reviews and tom ' s came up . from outside looks like your walking back in time , i dig the decor but it ' s like the other dude said your very cramped and you can feel the people behind you . nice guy and grandma to greet you and says sit wherever you like . the place was fairly empty but took a while for us to get menus . food was ehhhhhh . i had steak eggs with some grits . grits were horrible and the steak was terrible eggs were edible best . my girl had the pancakes and egg omelet pancakes and coffee are all i can say were good . waiters are nice though and they do try and make you feel welcomed that ' s why it ' s getting . 
this place was good , but line-outside-the-door-down-the-street-good ? definitely not . i have no idea why this place has so much hype on yelp . it ' s definitely average new york brunch quality . i was lucky to get seated right away ( hence avoiding the aforementioned line outside ) . seating is cramped- the servers can barely get to the tables it ' s so packed . basically you bump into your neighbors every time you get up from your seat . the " prixe fix " menu is a joke . you get a glass of orange juice ( that ' s been sitting on the table already ) and coffee with your entree . that ' s not a prixe fix meal- just an excuse to charge N . N per menu item . oh , and don ' t even think about substitutions . i had a chocolate croissant , which was a bit hard and the salmon sandwich . sandwich came out luke-warm with potatoes ( and way too much onion ) on the side . the decor has a cool ship cabin vibe , and service was fine ( though impatient ) . but what is all the hype about ? this is not a " hidden west village gem " , rather , an average , overinflated brunch spot- among countless offerings in the neighborhood . also , if you don ' t decide to take my word on it , fyi the place is cash only . 
great place ! went for lunch . . . staff were very friendly and knowledgable about the menu . . . the food was soo delicious it speaks for itself ! with the early opening extensive breakfast food and drink options , as a nurse , i am definitely going to make this a new after work Na spot ) ) 
the building itself is like an old bavarian castle in the heart of bayonne . i think that ' s what drew me in . the decor is a lot of fun , antique european artwork and wood carvings , and it was really clean . i went with friends , and the restaurant was busy so we sat at the bar . i tried everything my friends ordered . we ' re not shy about that . the fried calamari with spicy marinara was very light and fluffy , not overly chewy . it was perfect , actually . the sauce had a nice kick . ( side note i hate when you ' re expecting a spicy sauce and it ' s bland and mild . definitely not the case here . ) i had a salad with thinly sliced fried fresh mozzarella in a balsamic dressing , again , delicious . for the main course , i ordered the bobby o burgers , which are sirloin mini burgers with slab bacon and sauteed onions mixed in the chop meat and then marinated in steak sauce before being cooked . i didn ' t even remotely miss the cheese ( and i love cheese ) . they were so juicy . highly recommended . but , the next time i go , i am definitely ordering the reuben . oh . my . god . i tried my friend ' s , it might be the best reuben i have ever tasted . my other friend asked what the specialty was , and it was the steak sandwich . i tried it , it was very tasty . all in all , this is a new find and i ' ll be heading back often . can ' t recommend it enough . 
excellent mexican food ! went for brunch with a friend who had a coupon for brunch and two cocktails . they were very generous with the tequila in my margarita , and the hangar steak was delicious ! it wasn ' t very busy for a saturday afternoon , so our meals arrived rather quickly . will definitely go back again . 
had early lunch there yesterday , what a great spot . all open air with the giant garage doors open , so much good people watching it ' s wonderful . now the food , that ' s worth going for alone . i had a wonderful fritatta , my wife had the skirt steak salad and we got the " not on the menu " kids pizza and pasta for the , well kids . i hadn ' t been there for about N years and it was even better than i remembered . 
stopped by for drinks and an appetizer on the balcony in the summer sunshine at the end of a day of exploring burlington . loved the service , the flatbread pizza was tasty and a good size , and the cocktails available are varied and mine was excellent ( although i ' ve forgotten the name , but it had blueberries in it ) . looked like a great atmosphere for dinner too , but we were booked elsewhere , so can ' t comment on other menu options . 
once in a while a restaurant will come along and change your perception of a whole category of food . not only is the place clean with a great family atmosphere their version of " traditional recipes " is amazing . i ' m sure that judging by all of the other positive reviews on here no one would object to my calling it " the best grill in town . " 
just about perfect . hell , brancaccio ' s is better quality and taste than at least half of the restaurants in the slope and you get to chow comfortably at home rather than patiently ignoring inane slopey banter . win-win , friends . here ' s all you need to know N ) brownie buy one , eat it , you ' re welcome . try to keep it to one a week , if you can . N ) cinnamon roll seriously good . underrated . N ) flesh of animals flank , pork , chickens and meatballs . get them and you ' ll be very happy . various incarnations and all are excellent . N ) sandwiches rarely do i feel sandwiches are worth the money at most places . joe ' s are worth the money . N ) head ' s up this is not a mcdonalds . there are not fourteen-million of every item waiting patiently in a gigantic freezer just so you can have exactly what you want exactly when you want it . people love this place and they eat the hell out of the food here every day . many times , i don ' t get my brownie . i ' m cool about it . if you show up and they ' re out of something , be cool about it . use it as an opportunity to try something else and i promise you ' ll still be thinking , " oh sweet mother of tastebuds how did i live without this ? ! " 
my surver jennete was very nice and told us all the specials i had a meal that gives you one entree and either a desert or a appetizer i picked dessert i ordered a cheeseburger with a side of french fries and a coke the burger was amazing best burger i ever had in a restaurant ever then dessert tasted very good i had a melted brownie with ice cream tasted very good . overall staff was very nice and food tasted great . i recommend this place to whoever ' s reading this . 
stopped in for cortadito and coconut caramel custard . liked them both , liked the barrista , had a great time . will be back for dinner ! 
be prepared to wait over an hour for brunch at this popular spot . but it ' s worth it ! the food is scrumptious always the perfect portions and meticulously prepared . cute european cafe feel , with homey decor and little blue flowers painted on little rustic wooden tables . my salmon wrapped poached eggs were a great balance between meat and veggies . i left with a fully tummy but feeling like i had a complete , healthy meal . menu is a bit confusing but here ' s the low-down for wknd brunch pay N and get a dish off their brunch menu plus either a ) cocktail or b ) coffee tea juice , or order a la carte ( favorites like penny egg sandwich egg cheese pesto on yummy croissant are only available on this menu ) . fyi lunch dinner yummies like arugula salad chicken meatballs aren ' t available until N Npm on weekends ! 
the food is below average for the west village . the food is comfort food -- spaghetti and meatballs , chicken , etc . much of it pretty bland . this is basically an overcrowded bar masking as a restaurant . if you like the energy of crowds , this is fun ( but not good food ) . it is very crowded and very noisy . the service is poor . i ' ve been here three times . once as a couple , once with a group of N and once with a group of N . it is not possible to sit comfortably inside the restaurant with groups of N or N . we had a reservation for N and they seated us at a table for N and then complained to us that we were in their way . if you want a nice meal at a quiet place , go across the street to cafe cluny . if you want an italian restaurant go over a couple of blocks to corsino or to malaparte . if you want spanish try sevilla or salinas or if you want creative new american food try N on seventh ave . 
great food and great atmosphere ! 
great dumplings . the most reviews i have ever seen for a place , so that says alot about the place . 
my family and i were in the mood for some soul food relatively close to home . did a google search and found ol ' boys and took a chance . the food was good and the service was fast and friendly . my husband had the fish fried rice with a side of mac and cheese and he devoured it . my son had the chicken wings mac and cheese with the yams . he didn ' t like the yams , but only because they were cooked with raisins . i had the tilapia mac and cheese and greens and was very satisfied . we would definitely go back . you should support this store to keep businesses in our neighborhoods . . 
love sabrina ' s caf . its small and you have to get there early , otherwise you will have a long wait but its well worth it . 
had lunch there today , was yum . my lunch only date choose it and even though i will not see him again , i certainly would come back here again . chef mehta is phenomenal and talented and the lack of space doesn ' t do him justice . 
ok how is it that this place rocks so much that i miss it no matter where i go . maybe its the little burgers with holes in the meat , filled with onions ! man these tings are so good and far better than frozen . i mean frozen white castles ain ' t even close ! i can get N burgers , N fish sandwiches , N fry , N onion ring and a large drink for less than N . . but after you eat these things . . . . windy city ! ! ! banggoo time ! ! ! don ' t light a match ! ! ! be careful . they are amazingly addictive ! ! wish they had some here in ca ! ! 
have been long time fan of harry ' s pizza at bishops corner . i was very excited to have harry ' s gluten free pizzas . by far some of the best i ' ve eaten ! ! ! ! the atmosphere , wait staff , and beverage n wine selections are perfect . customer for life . . . . scott in tariffville
this review is well overdue . my husband and i found this great little pizza place driving around the area one day . we happend to live very close by at the time . from the first time we ate there , we were hooked . it ' s simply wonderful pizza and what a friendly owner , tino . . he and his best friend and brother all sat and chatted with us as we dined there for the last time before our move to the dc area . perfect neighborhood spot and totally unpretentious . we highly recommend this place and hope they open one up in northern va sometime soon ! ! ! ) 
good service but fatty food . . . 
the food is delicious . get the buns . menu is tough to get through . three different country hams ? wtf ? gotta love their groundbreaking credit card policy " no more than four credit cards accepted " is stated on the menu . it was about time someone took a stand . they have xlerator hand dryers ! very classy . 
let ' s face it . the tv show " friends " took the coffee house idea to new lows . not only did the cast have a lot of time to piss away in an eating and drinking establishment ( the beauty of make believe land ) but it brought about a kind of trite nature that independent cafes have been trying to break free of . while wandering around philly during a tuesday afternoon , i wanted to just grab a quick espresso for five minutes and continue on with my journey . cafe fulya fit the bill . the seating area is not too large , but that ' s ok , as i wasn ' t planning on staying the afternoon . the double espresso made the grade and the baklava is rich and delicious . some of the best i ' ve had . all in all a solid experience . a cafe like this is something that no neighborhood should be without . 
being a huge fan of austin , texas ' s tex-mex scene and having had real mexican food in its homeland , i am super excited this place has opened . this place is a true rarity on the east coast . from the small details of " worm salt " with their oysters , to having real edible cactus on the menu ! ! ! ! ! after my entree , which was the " la rosa " , i was so blown away by how they handled their fish that i had to order their " la mano " scallops immediately after . everything is so fresh and well prepared . the staff and service are extremely chill and relaxed , but very attentive . the atmosphere is definitely an eat and enjoy attitude instead of eat and hurry up one . can ' t wait to try the rest of their menu . " to all fans of guero ' s in austin , texas this place will be a no fail for you " . 
wow ! ! broke food lovers take note vanessa ' s is the place . the pork and chive dumplings are near perfect ! crisp and golden brown outside al dente , steaming and savory inside . a bit oily perhaps , but inspired nonetheless . i can ' t wait to try the others . the sesame pancake w beef would have been enough to sate me , but , like many of us , i suffer from add ( american dining disorder ) and couldn ' t believe a N menu item would do " the job . " i was wrong . i would prefer the tender , delicately sliced , perfectly seasoned roast beef to be prepared medium , but my god ! when paired with the sweet and crunchy julienne carrots , fresh sprigs of cilantro ( ? ) , and warm and chewy pancake , my tongue is obliged to wax pavlov-ian even now . in short , even if you don ' t live anywhere near the lower east side , do yourself a favor get there soon . . . eat there often . 
this is my local goto for pizza . staff is friendly and the food is always good . i live close so i pop in and pick up food to go . reg pizza , sicilian , margarita , all very good . zeppole are very good . 
loved this place ! my co-worker brought me here when i was visiting ny and it didn ' t disappoint . the food is excellent , the atmosphere is comfortable with very friendly staff . it ' s a great place for sharing dishes with people that enjoy good and interesting food . the food had a great presentation and well balanced flavors . i like how they gave us bacon flavored popcorn at the beginning and finished it with a small chilled bottle of yogurt . 
lovely restaurant in a perfect location near to the theater ( walnut street theater ) . the waitress was pleasant and attentive and the food was very good . 
a good friend and i came here several weeks ago and i can ' t get over how amazing an experience it was . the space is beautiful , with the front windows that open to the street , the brick walls that are half covered , half exposed , and the modest but beautiful reclaimed wood furniture . it feels old-timey and warm with decorations and installations that might have been found objects or actually designed to be there . we checked out the back courtyard-- all brick , with enough space to throw a small party ! we chilled at the center bar for several hours , had a few drinks and the following for dinner . . . -grilled radishes and feta -lamb croquettes -rice with yogurt and morels -chicken -lamb tartare we shared the dishes so we could taste them all ! the chicken was super tender and delicious . sara says they source all their food from local farmers , and that the menu will change with the seasons . it was fun watching folks come and go over the course of the night . neighborhood families , date night , friends meeting up to chat and drink , foodie people seeking out the new place in town . i love it , and i wish sara sara the best of luck ! 
this is mine and my husband ' s go to pho spot . we place the same order every time . the food is great , served hot and fresh . the prices are unbeatable and we always have a more than pleasant experience . the service isn ' t top notch but for what you ' re paying it ' s about right . we go back regularly and will continue to do so . 
being here in us , you may never be able to exceed the said limit as you get some tasty sea food . furthermore , upstate owns this prestige to have city ' s well honored elite here and taste the food served . i came to upstate back in july with some of my mates from office . it was an incredible experience which made me feel highly satisfied . both in terms of taste and liking of place , they excelled so beautifully that they are second to none and i really got impressed to them in such an excessive way out . i would recommend all my mates and other yelpers to come to this place whenever they get a chance to come to new york . this place will always retain its memories in your mind to which forgetting won ' t be enough easy . 
i ' d been wanting to go to ippudo for a while now , but the long wait always kept me away . go early ! we got there at about N and had no wait at all . we started with some sake and plum wine , which was nice . for an appetizer we had the shrimp buns . oh man . i don ' t know what i was expecting , but this certainly wasn ' t it . it was delicious . perfectly cooked shrimp in a perfectly steamed bun with an out of this world spicy sauce . i want more just thinking about it . we both ordered the akamaru modern ( the original " tonkotsu " noodle soup topped with ippudo ' s secret " umami dama " miso paste , pork chashu , cabage , kikurage , scallions , and fragrant garlic oil ) and i added a soft boiled egg because that ' s my favorite part of ramen . the sliced pork was flavorful , but thin . i wish there had been more than two pieces . you can ask for a second set of noodles if you wish ( kae-dama ) which is neat , but it ' s already a huge bowl . however , and i wish i ' d known this before , they have a very strict no take out policy . yes , you can get ippudo delivered , but you cannot take your food home with you if you don ' t finish . some of the best ramen i ' ve ever had . it was flavorful and filling and really just perfect . much better than the other places i ' ve been in nyc
omg . . . . that is all i can say ! ! ! i am a soldier here on a business meeting for N days , i ' ve traveled for over twenty years and all i can say in reference to the service . . . . . omg ! the cat fish . . . . omg ! ! the greens . . . . omg ! ! ! the cat cheese omg ! ! ! ! 
best chicken biscuit i have ever had . unbelievable gravy and radish combination . they put an enormous chicken finger on a homemade biscuit , which lays on a bed of radish . also salmon biscuit is great . the guy who owns it is the man , so nice and friendly . he gave me a free french donut . two annoying things -- the door to the restaurant is a nightmare . he should get rid of that door . it is a swinging glass door that doesn ' t open all the way , and is really heavy to open , especially when its crowded . secondly , it takes a while to make the sandwiches , but that ' s not really a big deal . 
i am alsacian , and each time i ' m in nyc , i have to stop by ! tartes flamb es here are even better than at home , all the ingredients are perfectly balanced , the crust is just crispy as it needs to be . . . i never eat onions , but this place is an exception ! i love the way they are cooked ! the place is nicely decorated and convivial . . . with friends or family , we always are warmly welcomed ! my favourite tartes flamb es gratin e , foresti re , biquette for the sweet ones , try calva it is flamb e with calvados directly at your table , amazing and delicious ! ! 
friendliest staff . most delicious thanksgiving between two incredibly flavorful slices of whole grain bread sandwich i ' ve ever had . trust , the plymouth will change your life . best , and biggest , chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting around . coffee , both hot and iced , is the perfect balance of acidity , flavor , and texture . my only complaint , the scones . while flavor is always great ( though the jalapeno-laden ones could have smaller pieces of pepper ) , the interior is often . . . gummy ? maybe the batter is over mixed ? maybe it contains too much liquid ? i don ' t know . but regardless , i will - and have - continue to eat them . a lot . 
the quality of the meat is really good in the pho . i enjoyed the crudo i started with as well , but it was less exciting . location is not the easiest to get to - i suppose it ' s pretty " hipster " and adds to that vibe , but we had an enjoyable meal . love the byob vibe - very small and i can appreciate the we do a few things well sentiment - and they do . the pho itself was a little on the bland side unless you add the herbs they give you and some sriracha , but the quality of ingredients was great . they were out of bahn mi when we went , so we ' d like to return to try that out next time , i ' d go again , but not often - it ' s too far and i ' ve been told there are other good pho places to check out . 
horrible horrific terrifying service ! ! do you like to be put in a bad mood ? do you like being treated like crap ? if you answered yes to any of the following- make your way to yuca bar . 
i came here with my three girlfriends for dinner before a long night out . we ordered . . . N bottle of red wine dim sum sampler pad thai vegetable fried rice five spice duck breast beef tenderloin crying chocolate dim sum doughnuts we split the check and it was N person . quite a deal ! everything was delicious . restaurant ambiance was pretty . staff was also attentive and friendly . would definitely recommend ! 
my review is based more on the food i ordered . this was a place that i walked by in alphabet city that looked nice from the outside . it would be a good place to take a date . i made a note of it , and i came back there another day to try it out . i had the vaca frita , and also a side order of papas rellenas ( stuffed potatoes ) . the papas rellenas were very good . you get two of them for N . N . the vaca frita on the other hand was a bit disappointing . it was pretty dry and did not taste that flavorful . it should be tender and juicy , but it was not . i ' d be willing to go there to try another entree , but not that one . 
meant to be a nyc classic , i unfortunately did not think this was the finest example of nyc ' s best pizza to an out-of-towner . the pizza was good , solid really , but not outstanding . it did the trick , and will impress anyone who is from asia ( where good pizza is extremely rare , if non-existent ) , but the ingredients don ' t exactly sing and the crust is a bit too thick for my personal tastes . also had a calzone - that was very very filling
when i go for spanish tapas , i am looking for jaleo quality tapas . these were not found at alta . the sangria was great and i loved the intimate atmosphere , but the food was lacking . service was friendly and nonintrusive . the food service timing was good . the food itself was just ok . wish there was a jaleo in new york . go for drinks at the bar , but i would skip the food . 
great place . been here N times - tried a different sandwich each time , and loved them all . the staff is always very nice . the fries are ok , but need improvement . 
their vegetables are not clean . when i ordered a chicken broccoli , it has sand in there . the front desk got an attitude when i called and asked for change . don ' t try this one . 
this bubby ' s seems to better than the one near the high line . food was decent as was the atmosphere . service was good and the place is kid friendly . prices are not cheap but that should be expected in tribeca . 
percy street is a solid choice . i went here for my birthday with my friends and they were very friendly and accommodating . we got a big picnic style table and the staff was friendly , quick and cute ! the vibe is very laid-back , fun and comfortable . their decor is cool , really rustic and a little vintage i liked it a lot . i wish it was in n . libs instead of south street , but it ' s not a big deal . they have a lot of interesting beers and a cool make your own N-pack deal , which we did a few of . i got the pork belly sandwich and it was very good . not too big that i felt uncomfortable , but filling . the spicy bbq sauce was a really nice touch since they served everything a little on the dry side . i also split a side of mac and cheese which was super delicious and i ' d recommend . i got key lime pie for dessert , which was really creamy and tart , and is one of my favorites so i really liked it . of course you could get better bbq in the south , and probably at other places in philly , but percy street was a good choice and i ' d come back ! the energy inside was really nice and fun and the food tasted great . 
i don ' t eat italian so much , so i wasn ' t sure what to expect during this fine dining experience . i was blown away . the entrees seem small , but are very filling . my favorites were the tagliatelle bolognese and beef carpaccio dishes . 
food was average . 
glasserie is a " hidden gem " worth visiting , but shhhhh don ' t tell anyone . . . there ' s no two ways about , glasserie is cool . like , really cool . so cool , i had to program my gps to help my cab driver find the place---tucked away in an old factory just off newtown creek in northern greenpoint . mismatched stools , racks of assorted potted plants , exposed brick walls and geometric wallpaper . the space is effortlessly interesting . a cynic might call glasserie " hipster , " but i ' d say that ' s wrong . the food is ambitious and a few of our brunch dishes missed the mark . strangely , i ' d still wholeheartedly recommend trying the food because the plates were so imaginative and unique . i went with the puff pastry with eggs--which was way too big for its delicate flavors . but , it ' s still worth a try for the amazing combination of herbs . for the table , we ordered the griddle bread with pollen syrup which had a great floral taste and wasn ' t overly sweet ( not like typical pancakes where you have a few bites and then wish you ordered an egg ' s benedict . . . ) . let ' s be real , nothing stays secret in the city for long . and , i ' m far too yelp crazed to try to keep this place under wraps . but , if you head to glasserie soon , you might be able to catch it while it ' s " authentic " --whatever that means ! 
i go there with my husband once in a while , very nice place-good food , good service and relaxed . not pretentious . i would recommend for those who want to have some peaceful time and conversation . i did not try meat theorem but fish was cooked good . 
this is the best gluten free place i have been to . their dishes are flavorful , interesting and with good presentation . service is impeccable and ambiance is very nice , good for a date night or diner with your friends . great food and great service , it doesn ' t get better than this . 
this is the most ignorant hick bar i have ever encountered . ive been several times and on every occasion ive had to leave in a hurry for my own safety . its seems to be a good mixed crowd but the regulars don ' t like newcomers and will engage you for any reason . the bartenders are jerks and cater to the jerks that dominate this place . if you like fist fights , bitchy bar maids and ignorant a holes , then this place is for you . i am ashamed that this is my local bar . 
love having brunch here ! the service is great and burgers are so delicious ! great place to hang with friends too ! 
stopped in for dinner on N N N , part of their soft open . food was fantastic . we ordered several of their appetizers as tapas , and a single entree . the popcorn shrimp was amazing . the wasabi flavoring is amazing without the burn . the fried calamari was presented really well , and was plentiful . wasnt your typical deep fried calamari with marinara sauce the lamb skewers could not have been cooked any better . the pan seared scallops with mango salsa was fantastic . great complimenting flavors . the lobster wasabi mashed was incredible . gotta love real potatoes getting mashed . the wasabi again was great and the lobster finishes the flavors out wonderfully . the tofu and asaparagus dish was a typical dish really , but with great sauce . and the salmon with green curry as an entree was great . the salmon was cooked to perfection , although the curry flavor wasnt as present as i would ' ve liked . the salmon definitely outpowered the curry . the decor was fantastic as well as the friendly and helpful staff . kudos jane g ' s , kudos
work in bloomfield and come here at least twice a week . the rotating menu has a great variety and there is always something delicious to choose from , whether it is the healthy salads and wraps , juicy burgers , or pasta dishes . definitely the best deal in town . for N-N , you get tons of fresh home-made food . i think the secret is out -- lunch gets crowded . great joint . 
tex mex at its best . this place gets crowded so either arrive early , or expect to wait . if you do decide to wait , it ' ll be well worth it . you ' re in for a real treat . not authentic mexican , but it is delicious . great for a nice outing with friends . 
i came here to pick up some ingredients for dinner . . . pasta . . . shrimp tomato sauce . first of all there were mobs of people and tourists everywhere . . . is it a market place , grocery store ? restaurant ? sandwich bar ? the place seems a little confused . however i will say my fresh squid ink pasta was delicious and one of a kind . coming on a saturday afternoon may have been a bad idea . . maybe i ' ll have better luck next time . 
phillips is by far the better option for a cheesesteak on passyunk . . . . its not near any of the people watching or shopping spots in town , unless you ' re gonna people watch in bj ' s or the dollar tree around the corner . but its worth the drive since the steaks are made when you order them . not just sitting on a grill waiting to be bought . i love that they have great fries that are dropped per order also . can ' t figure out why you have to pay for and pickup your fries and drinks from a separate window than where you order your sandwich , but its a minor inconvenience . when my wife and kids want to cross the bridge for a cheesesteak , phillips is the place they ask for . great food , and no attention seeking owners with over inflated egos there . 
last week we tried their lunch platters . they were good but not great . i agree with the others that the price is high compared to lunch buffets around princeton . 
good place to have an informal dinner and drinks . reasonable price , close to movie theater , large bar seating avail . 
dinner N N N at N Npm the food is tasty but i was treated so rudely and with such disdain by the smarmy little chap ( stands at podium , guides you to your table , etc . ) that i will never go back . not only was he dismissive and downright rude , he was disrespectful and literally hissed in my face . the manager of the restaurant didn ' t seem to surprised , so after many a lovely meal i will not be going back . . . to drive home the point , the behavior was so bad we did not finish our food and just left . note to restaurant " fire that little bitch " . 
everything on the menu is delicious fajitas are amazing and the pastelitos appetizer is out of this world . . be ready to wait for a seat but its worth thd wait . . service is always goodj
aaaand i ' m back . this place is still perfect . this time i came with my boyfriend he had the fried pork dumplings and beef sesame pancake while i had the veg boiled dumplings and the mung bean soup . we both only got N dumplings each but we were still so full after out meals . the mung bean soup was warm and not too sweet--my favorite . once again , the dumplings were delicious . the boyfriend really likes his dumplings and the sesame pancake too , so we ' re looking forward to our next trip here ! 
burger is great awesome tasty meat good crust on outside perfect temperature inside - great juiciness bun is good and well toasted everything came together great , did not need condiments on burger . fries were great overall rating a-
fresh food , good service and the ambiance is equivalent to that of a cozy nook . black bean burger is delicious , as is the calamari appetizer , however the brunch here is a true weakness of mine . get there early on a sunday and check it out yourself . satisfaction is definitely guaranteed . 
the guys that serve it usually the last guy is a complete a , they think they have the best food or are entitled to something , i go to any cart that hes not at , they are all the same ! people that stand at the other cart , , smh just shows how america is so quick fall for a trap . people open your eyes , you cant tell ! ? they are the same company ? the owners switched up due to fall out so they all hate each other but they were all brothers . the food is great tho . not the best but its whateves
over-rated . i was dragged here recently by friends who were visiting from out of town . each time , it is more disappointing than the last . the wait is simply too long for pizza that is soggy on the bottom and for a staff that gets offended when we ask for pepper flakes and oregano . sorry guys , but i will avoid . 
we have only been coming here for N years but i will say this is the best napoliteano pizzeria in the us . francis the owner is a remarkable person . we picked up a pie for my birthday today and he was a real pleasure . . . ciao . . . . 
best bagels in the area ! brings me back to being a kid and walking to the local bagel store for a hot bagel out of the oven . they are big and fluffy on the inside with a nice crust outside . made on site which you don ' t see anymore by the chains . sandwiches are great too . breakfast or lunch . 
umumum , sashimi are fresh , better than many japanese restaurant here in philly . udon are tasty , but need more seafood in it service good
i ' ve lived in the area for awhile i don ' t know what took me so long to eat there . the sandwich was great and the owner treats people with respect and cares about his sandwiches . i had one of the specials of the day it was excellent . the concept is very unique with drum sets in the window but still it ' s a deli and they make you feel at home . 
please see xanga . com feed moonbunny for my review , complete with yummy-licious pictures ! ( a feature i desperately wish yelp had ) 
the falafel ( large ) is served in a freshly baked ( white or wheat ) pita . unlike most falafel joints , hummus is a default condiment , along with the pickled cabbage , tomatoes , israeli salad and tahini . the hot sauce is flavorful , but not especially hot , at least not to the capsaicinaholic . they pack the pita with fresh , savory falafel and serve the sandwich warm . for just N , mamas falafel is a cheap and satisfying way to bed down your appetite . the stools arrayed at the store front window offer a pleasant view of the passers by near rittenhouse park . 
nice atmosphere , great food , good portions , irish music and wonderful staff ! best meal in new haven so far ! 
i had the worst sushi dinner at this restuarant . i had been to ginza in bloomfield , it was not bad , but the one in wethersfield was aweful ! we arived at the restuarant and there was no customer at all . i thought about walking out , but felt weird so we ended up staying for dinner . the sushi was not good and the prices are high . they give you very little food for a high price . we had to end up going over to sake restuarant because we were still hungry after paying over N . 
best affordable asian food in the state right here thanks tiny thai ! 
excellent food and great service ! a place to take families and friends and have a good time . ps- they have a foot-tapping selection of hindi film songs for advertising needs contact info touchdown-media . com
i found myself at the ssam bar upon the recommendation i found online as well as from some locals here in new york . being a fan of traditional korean cuisine , i arrived with an appetite full of anticipation . being a busy spot , the genial hostess was unfortunately unable to put our names down for a table until our group was complete . that was fair enough , considering that there was a growing mass spilling onto the pathway waiting for tables . while our group waited for a table at the adorable milk bar , there seems to be a sense of camaraderie amongst the crowd as i was offered some of a stranger ' s blueberry cookie while sipping on my rose . finally , we were ushered to our communal table where we immediately placed an order for a dozen oysters and two servings of pork buns ( N buns per serve ) . the oysters arrived casually on a utilitarian platter of ice- each mollusk cradled in its half shell dotted with a version of kimchi sauce . the result is a melodic marriage of heat ( chilli ) and cold . fabulous ! my company were very excited about the pork buns . while they were admittedly delish and more-ish , i can ' t help but draw parallels to its better tasting traditional version which includes crisp lettuce . for our main courses , we had soft shell crab and hanger steak- both of which were beautifully prepared and in a serving that is ideal for each person . if you are hanging for a a gastronomic feast expecting to be fed as much as a goose for foie gras , don ' t waste your time here . but if you want to enjoy a good meal through grazing over delicate yet bombastic platters with good company in an energetic yet intimate space , make sure you arrive early ! 
small location , friendly staff and fantastic food ! as noted in some unkind reviews , the location is small and does not look modern or well kept . it is completely serviceable as a diner and more than makes up for it in food quality . the falafel was the perfect mix of a crunchy exterior and rich , moist interior . the grape leaves were sweet and vinegary as you like . the soup of the day was a wonderful vegetable soup . a thin yellow broth , hiding beneath its depths , huge chunks of delightful garden veggies ! when they ask if you want you hummus spicy , you say yes ! the spicy sauce they add is complex and well spicy . it was a good surprise from the regular , kinda-spicy , kinda-flavorful hot sauce . also , they add an entire salad as a side to any platter . huge fan . 
my husband i stopped by this restaurant after spending a day at the spa . what a perfect end to what started out as a great day together . there was no shortage on anything at this restaurant . our server , tabs , recommended a cocktail for my husband and he loved it . our appetizer , asian wings , were perfect . our entree ' s were absolutely out of this world . my husband order the red velvet waffles and fried chicken . all he could say was " wow , wow " . of course , i had to taste a forkful and i was speechless . i ordered the lobster and shrimp with grits . oh my goodness ! ! ! ! ! these were two ( N ) of the best meals i have had outside of my house in a long time . we had to meet the chef and shake the hand that prepared such a delicious meal . my husband ordered the peach cobbler and tabs was able to find peaches and creme ice cream , to make it all complete . i have to thank every person that attened to our every need while we were at soco . the music was great as well . thanks to the dj . can not wait to go back . brunch on sunday . 
my favorite mexican steak tacos . great taste and authentic . lived in california and it was easy to find mexican tacos there , but not so easy here . i was looking for a while and i am happy i found it . 
bagel train has the best bagels by far ! i absolutely love their grilled sandwiches ! i take my daughter and son here every weekend . the bagels are hand-rolled and boiled , something you can ' t find within many miles from here . the owner is polite and friendly . she ' s owned this business for over fifteen years . the prices are fair and the service is great . this is a family run business . during the weekends , her kids come to help out . i would definitely recommend trying their bagels if you haven ' t already . 
one of our closest friends came to visit us not long after moving to new haven , and she had never been here so we of course spent some time walking around downtown and yale ' s campus . stomachs started grumbling , and after listing options and checking out menus , she proclaimed that prime N had the superior appetizer list ( which is apparently how she judges restaurants ) and therefore was our lunch destination . it was tuesday , so easy to get a table for us three . our server was ok , not the friendliest but on top of answering our few questions and making sure we were doing well periodically throughout the meal . we shared the artichoke dip per her recommendation , and it was tasty , hot from the oven with toasted pita chips to dip . we each ordered different entrees my husband got the smoker with fries , while us two ladies opted to " make our own " our friend had the mushroom beef burger topped with sauteed portobellos , avocado , and goat cheese with sweet potato fries , and i got their bison burger topped with oven roasted tomatoes , sauteed onions and crimini mushrooms , with their sauteed kale and garlic as my side . burgers were sizable and cooked medium-rare as requested , and the side portions are ridiculously large . very tasty flavors ( i ' ll have to try their signature combinations next time ) , everything was cooked well , including the crispy fries which were still hard to finish completely . i only wish that they used less oil with the sauteed kale . our friend was especially satisfied with her choice in lunch venue . we will definitely be back so that we can pair our burgers with some beer ! 
coming from nyc , i ' m on the quest for a decent slice here in lebanon new hampshire . i went for their carnivore pizza . it tasted like the N for N deals at the local pizzeria i had back in college when i was broke except i had to fork over N for a plain old mediocre pie . they skimped on the toppings . there was barely enough sauce on the pizza . and the sauce cheese ratio is way off . the crust is ok . i get it , this is new hampshire , not new york we ' re talking about . but no way is this even passable for a N pizza . even the rich college kids in hanover may balk at this . will not be going back . 
couldn ' t say something bad about this place if i tired . great environment . wonderful service , and seriously , food so good it ' ll make you want to slap your mom . 
went with my mom after the ballet . jason sessions was a delightful waiter . all the staff was friendly , engaged and really competent . food was great . the fried spinach salad was literally amazing . can ' t wait to go back ! ! ! 
overall great good . quick delivery . hot food was hot , cold food was cold , and it was yummy . i wish they ' d not chintz on butter . . . i had N bread rolls and one baked potato and only got N tiny butter packets and no salt . but , i ' d order again , the good was good and staff was courteous . 
loved the cozy vintage southern ambiance , but found that the restaurant was strangely loud and it was hard to talk over dinner . luckily , we were too preoccupied with how good the food for it to matter . we started with some cocktails , then ordered the escargot toast and the duck rillette . both were flavorful and amazing . however- and i ' m not sure if it was because we had a few cocktails and wine with or because the appetizers were so flavorful- but the entrees were immemorable . we ordered the braised pork hock and the steak . they were . . . good , but nothing jumped out about them . given how good the rest of the experience had been until that point , we were kind of disappointed . in the future i might come back and stick to cocktails and appetizers at the bar . 
you know you should think twice about a place this overrated , where the first question is " have you been here before ? " , as in , we do things our way here and you ' d better like it . i live a few blocks from here and have eaten their pizza as takeout . tasty stuff , not as good as grimaldi , though the basil garlic is a nice touch . but is it a fair comparison ? this kind of pizza is best enjoyed seconds from the oven . . . so to settle the score when i finally went to check them out , the waitress announced that they were out of pepperoni . out of pepperoni ! ? ! what kind of self respecting pizza joint runs out of pepperoni ? it ' s like an inuit in winter saying he can ' t build an igloo , since he ' s out of ice . to be continued . . . 
fancy smancy and close to the art district ) totally love this place the decor is so pleasant so luxurious yet its homie . the food is a . my experience with estia was great from beginning to end ! ! ! 
the truffle parm fries at the bar with some cold beers , good friends , and the game on any of the numerous tv screens a i really wish i could give this place a half a star . i hadn ' t been in a while , and went last night for a drink with friends , and the bartender was the rudest human being on the face of the earth . she snapped at us when we asked if we had to order at the bar . then when we went up to order , she stood on the other end of the bar ( where people were eating and it did not look like there was room for us to place our drink order ) and then barked at us to come over there to order . then , when my friend gave her her license , she kept on questioning her license , since it was pretty beat up . ( my friend also carries her passport in case people don ' t believe that her license is legit- when presented with this , she snapped as well ) . i ' ve never had such horrible service attitude thrown my way . definitely will avoid the place if that bartender happens to be working . 
this is the best indian restaurant around here . it ' s a tiny little place , a bit off the beaten path , but i ' ve never had to wait too long . i always get the stuffed calamari , which is kind of a weird thing to get at an indian restaurant , but trust me , it ' s delicious . great breads and appetizers . i ' ve also had some of the chicken dishes , like the jalfrezi and tikka masala , and both have been excellent . highly recommend ! updated to say the calamari is gone - i went N weeks ago and it ' s off the menu ! both my daughter and i were totally bummed . bring it back ! 
i ' m actually mad , son . i ' ve been meaning to start leaving reviews but nothing inspired me to take the time until the overwhelming whateverness that is sakura filled me such foodie disdain . this is real beef . sakura is the biggie to my pac . sike . it ' s more like the lil b to my pac , meaning this food was wild corny and suspect . all i wanted was a snack so i thought i ' d grab some dumplings . i walked passed dim sum garden because i ' ve been there too often so i figured i ' d hit up the original dsg on Nth for old times sake . i wanted to grab some regular pork and chive dumplings , not even the soup jawns . that soup dumpling xiao long bao shit is too iggy azaela now . y ' all really fucked it up . anyway , i passed the new dsg and was on my way to hit the old dsg but right in between that walk is sakura . i ' ve lived in philly all my life and chinatown for almost N years now and always seen sakura kind of busy but it never seemed to be my thing . it bothers me when chinese places do too much and serve volcano rolls and shit . leave that shit alone ! just do you , booboo ! that ' s why i always steered clear of sakura and pretty much any other place that does like every asian food ever . that ' s a tip from an asian guy , btw . don ' t fuck with those thirsty ass restaurants . if they did one thing good , they ' d stick with it . but they don ' t , so they compensate with variety . aight , so i thought i ' d give sakura a shot because i saw on their neon signage ( another desperate ploy that should ' ve been a red flag ) that they had pan-fried shanghai soup dumps . i ' ve been craving the fried jawns recently , thinking back to last year when i had them in shanghai at yang ' s dumplings . that shit was incredible and changed my life . i ' ll never look at a dumpling the same ever again . i let nostalgia get the best of me and i turned back and made my way into sakura . i ordered and the wait was wild long but honestly , you won ' t see me complain too much about service ever so if that ' s what you ' re into , you ' re looking at the wrong reviewer . i ' ll actually take bad service to the neck and sacrifice all that if the food is incredible . that ' s just how my priorities stack . but yo , i was looking for something that resembled yang ' s dumplings in shanghai and what i got was bread dressed up as dumplings for halloween . this shit a couple weeks too early for all that . these thick ass , flavorless ass , soupless ass , dressed up with black sesame seeds ass dumplings were spongy as fuck and i was soaking them in ginger sauce just to give it some type of taste . i promise every bite i took pissed me off more than the last . i shook my head as i looked at these " dumplings " like they were my children bringing home bad grades . i wasn ' t even mad , i was disappointed . nah , fuck that . i was mad . i ' m going to wrap this up . i ' m honestly wild into food and you ' ll see that from my upcoming reviews and my palate is actually on par with y ' all pretentious michelin star mother fuckers so when i say sakura was booty butt cheeks , then that shit was booty butt cheeks . i ain ' t going back and you can ' t make me . 
awesome , awesome , awesome . i cant really say more than that , but i ' ll try - ) we got to penny cluse on a friday , after trying magnolia but being rudely turned away . it was a toss-up as to our breakfast spot , so we ended up here . pure serendipity . we arrived around N Nish and the place was already half-full . good sign . but , we were seated quickly and got coffee just as fast . ( good coffee , too . . . ) . wow , what a menu ! can i have one of everything ? but , since we were were dining with our two-year old , we order with him in mind . my wife couldnt decide between the special french toast - zucchini bread french toast with a honey ricotta , or the omelette with fresh local mozzarella , organic tomatoes , basil and such . when she asked for the waitress ' recommendation , she told my wife she could get the omelette , and instead of toast , they could fix her one piece of the special french toast . sold ! how nice and accommodating they were . i got the bellber combo - N eggs scrambled ( soooo good . . and soooo fluffy ! ) , N gingerbread pancakes and home fries . awesome potatoes . . . yellow yukon golds with good seasoning and nice crust . anyway , our two year old got the nicest looking fruit plate this side of carmen miranda , and shared some of mine . oh , and so delicious , we went back saturday before leaving town . just as good . . . . almost worth the three hour drive from albany alone . 
as far as places in newark goes , this place is my favorite . so cozy , homey , artsy but down to earth a real delight when the staff is incredibly personable , there ' s free wifi , and a good selection of drinks and homemade meals . this places screams diy all over , and sometimes the people they train up may have a bit of inexperience , although they have their share of more savvy and skillful baristas , but the place makes up for it by providing a great space to hang out , have a conversation , play a few games , and relax to a good book . 
walking down manhattan ave looking for quality wine bar to spend a cozy evening , my friends and i stumbled on milk and roses , the newest place where you can have the best wine experience in the williamsburg-greenpoint area . all wines are imported from their regions in italy , and the food is the finest italian gourmet-quality . for the price you pay for watered-down wine in the rest of the neighborhood , this place gives you your money ' s worth . highly recommended . 
i came here with a group of friends a few weeks ago . the staff was very friendly and fun and even got us all up to take pictures on their " addicted to cheese " prison wall ! the food was absolutely delicious and very good portions . i had the truffle mac and cheese which was outrageous . i think i inhaled it . i also tasted the manchengo cheese sticks which were amazing . the concept is great , especially for cheese lovers . they even have a gluten free option ! i would N go back here and highly recommend it ! they are doing a great job after only just opening and i can ' t wait to try something ( everything ) else ! ! ! 
this place rocks ! i love shopping here ! the selection is great , the staff are nice and its very clean ! 
finally ! a restaurant that serves paleo friendly gluten cuisine ! fresh ' clean ' hearty food that ' s good for the body and soul and well worth the price to get such quality ! chicken was fall off the bone tender and delicious , beef saltados was the perfect amount of spicy with crisp veggies and tender beef . . . . ceviche loaded with calamari , shrimp . . . and finally a place i can order dessert without the guilt . . . decadent sweet potato brownies ! add the quaint atmosphere and owners who are warm and welcoming making sure their diners are taken care of and it ' s the perfect place for a night out . 
was only here for wine and cheese . bar is gorgeous - beautiful redesign staff very friendly . cheeses were good as was th wine ! i ' ll eventually be back for dinner . 
i used to be a die hard pizza addict and worked pretty close to this area which meant i was at grimaldis on a monthly basis . then i moved away and that ' s when grinaldis switched locations and this pizza place opened . when i came to visit some freinds i stopped at the new gramaldis location , waited on the long line , and ended up with average pizza . today the bf and i decided to go relax in brooklyn bridge park and wanted to get some pizza so we stopped here . it was fast and fantastic ! the line was Nx shorter then grimaldis next door , we were at a table in N minutes and this was at N Npm dinner time . we had a waiter at our table in just a few minutes and the pizza was at our table in another N-N . the pizza was delicious , we got margarita pizza and both of us were very happy with it . overall it was a great experience at a touristy place where i didn ' t expect that speed and deliciousness . 
i had such high expectations probably because i was really craving tacos . ordered the steak taco and shrimp taco . huge disappointment . the shrimp taco had absolutely no flavor at all . just some lukewarm shrimp on a doughy tortilla . the steak was a little better though not by far . again lacking get flavor and still a super doughy tortilla . they could have at least grilled it a little . never again . waste of N
love this place ! awesome beer selection , fantastic food and a great atmosphere . definitely try the burgers and the shrimp app . friendly bartenders that make you feel like a regular . highly recommend ! 
great steaks , love this place ! ! ! ! ! 
stopped in for a late late breakfast at the legendary clinton st . baking company ( note even at N N pm on a monday , there was a N minute wait ) . thought we were being slick , going on a weekday afternoon . . . . still had to wait . the host was extremely friendly and sat us N minutes earlier than we thought . the ambiance and service are only so-so here and the prices are average for manhattan . we split a biscuit to start , it was massive and probably the high point of the meal . also , their preserves ( homemade ? ) are amazingly good-definitely do this as an " appetizer " ( also you will be famished from waiting to be sat for so long ) . girlfriend had the famed blueberry pancakes , which were delicious , i opted for the southern breakfast . the cheese grits were underwhelming , but the fried green tomatoes hit the spot . i saw someone order the chicken sandwich-it looked excellent- will definitely try that if i ever find myself here again . overall , hyped to max-but still a solid breakfast . 
can ' t say enough about this place . waited for the daily show , they recommended them , and when we told the bartender-we got happy hour pricing . top reasons to go there taylor ham cheap beer skee ball tater tot menu cute bartenders N cent wings with N pitchers dee-lish
if you were walking by N eldridge st . you would do just that walk by . this hole in the wall walk up joint has a limited menu and a hectic pace . i was showing two friends around new york and i had found this place and marked it on google . for N we were all three full and we agreed it may have been one of the best tasting meals we had . we had the fried pork and green onion dumplings and we shared a slice of the fryed sesame bread . if i lived in new york i would take the subway here at least once a week . 
there are many dumpling places around the les that charge about the same for dumplings and i ' ve had them at a few of those places , some better than others but none as good as prosperity dumplings ! ! ! best dumplings evah ! ! ! prosperity dumpling fed me pretty much all summer when i lived on the les . i would always get the N N pork and chive dumplings , fresh , hot and fluffy delish ! sometimes i would be super hungry and get the dumplings , the pork buns ( N N ) and some wonton soup for N . N and it was a feast all for N . N ! i live in bk now and don ' t frequent prosperity as much as i did this summer ( at least N times a week ) but whenever i get a craving for them i hop off the train and grab some dumplings before heading back home . also i just remembered something while i was typing this review , you can get a bag of frozen dumplings and cook them at home yourself and it ' s something like N dumplings for N . N ! i know where i ' m going tomorrow ! 
the line was pretty long going inside . i enjoyed the roast pork sandwich , it ' s huge but nothing too fancy . just go early if you want to avoid the huge line . 
a top nyc dining experience , without being pretentious . located in the heart of the west village , this restaurant is one you will definately want a return visit to . the atmosphere , service , and especially the food are just downright spot-on ! make a reservation in advance . 
upon entering , you ' re in a dimly lit , loft-like space with high ceilings , yet , still cozy . the design is cool , and i liked the aesthetic . the staff was really friendly and nice , but , i will say , kind of slow . i was left with too much time to look at the menu , when it ' s not really that extensive . and , throughout the meal , had i needed anything , i would have waited a while . as someone who ' s waited tables once upon a time , i understand dinner rushes , but , there ' s still no excuse for letting a table sit without checking on them . on to food and beverages . so , we ordered everything at the same time , but , our appetizer came out well before our drinks . i usually prefer the opposite . for an appetizer , we got crispy brussels sprouts with lemon miso sauce and aleppo pepper . 
i ' ve been here a few times and had good pizza , though nothing extraoridinary . i like the idea of this place , but the staff gives a lot glares . their olive oil gelato is pretty amazing . the last time i went was on a thursday night . there was some mix-up with the number of people in our party which led to a disastrous seating situation . it actually wasn ' t a big deal at all . at any other restaurant , the hostess and manager would have been accommodating - all they had to do was let two extra people sit down at our table ( tables are communal , yes , but there was enough space for more people at our table ) . instead , the hostess gave us a bunch of eye-rolls and then brought the manager out who accused my friend and i of lying to him about the number of people in our party . he straight up called us liars and argued with us for over N minutes about whether or not our two friends could sit at our huge table with us . i should note that there was no wait for seating at this time . the whole thing was pretty hilarious . we had the worst service ever . our server would barely look at us because , apparently , we had personally offended her manager by telling him lies ( ridiculous ) . on our way out , we were half way down the block and the hostess ran out of the restaurant , yelled " have a wonderful evening " very sarcastically , then ran back inside . the whole thing was unbelievable . but the olive oil gelato is so good , so it gets two stars . and it gave my friends and i something to laugh about on the train ride home . no beard , no service . 
my girl friend and i love this place . we take the speed line over on the weekend . we love to have breakfast and lunch there so many great food places and we get our produce and amish farm products to bring home . 
greens are so good . . . . then the fish . . . oh my . you can try silvia ' s if you want , but you can not ever go wrong here at amy ruth ' s . i ' m from cali , but i always stop here when in nyc . and the corn bread is amazing . don ' t believe me ? try it yourself and let me know . 
delicious amazing burger . spiced meat , perfect bun , plenty of condiments , good atmosphere . great place to get an incredible burger . 
i had the best hot antipast platter here ever ! ! well worth the price - the wine here is amazing and the staff is super friendly - i came here last month for my friend ' s birthday and they gave us the royal treatment ( all kinds of free treats ! ) i def reccomend becco ! 
prospect heights has an upscale restaurant . the pizza is absolutely delicious , the service is attentive and professional , and the space has been superbly restored . oh ya , it ' s byob ! welcome to the neighborhood barboncino , i predict you will be here for many years . 
i love ramen and this is one of the best places in nyc . go . it ' s worth the wait . 
i went in for a business lunch because the location was very close to my clients office , but i would make the trip to go back . food was excellent and the service was great . reasonably priced as well . 
i love it here . the margaritas are really good and they have a nice beer assortment as well . the food is also very tasty . lots of young people here and it has really helped the popularity of this south philly neighborhood . cucumber margaritas in the summer are fantastic . nice and refreshing on a hot summer ' s night . 
i had a wonderful time at la fuorno . i had never eaten in this part of town , and was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant . the waitress was very attentive , and the manager made us feel at home . the food was fresh and delicious ! byob and a bar . a fantastic experience from appetizers to dessertsll ! ! 
try the garlic shrimp , it is excellent . don ' t forget to bring your own wine . 
the best in all of nyc ! wish they had more seating though . . . 
food not that great for its price ! alcohol is way to high . . . i got charged N for a mixed drink ! ! ! if u have the time between your flights go back to terminal c much better restaurants there
this is the only broth place i have been to . the service was very quick and the broth , amazing . my boyfriend got the hearth broth which was very fresh and had a ginger taste to it . definitely has health benefits . the broth was on the saltier side , but overall it was a great experience . 
delicious meal in a great atmosphere on a cute street . i ate the yogurt and herbs , the persian spiced chicken wings and the pappardelle . i had the jalepeno margarita too . the yogurt an herb dish was delicious - it reminded me of the mos ' o ' khiar my mother would make . the chicken wings were cooked so that they were tasty and crunchy instead of greasy and fatty . and the pappardelle was delicious ( i love shiitake mushrooms ! ) . the jalepeno margarita was super spicy but i love spicy drinks so i highly recommend it . overall i highly recommend bijan ' s ! 
as i live a block away , kite and key is my go-to quick lunch late night stop . the bartenders and servers are always super-friendly , especially if you ' re regular-ish . i ' m not a beer drinker , but my friends are , and they rave about the constant turnover of interesting brews . great selection of locals and seasonals . the food menu changes pretty regularly . i ' d recommend the wings or the mussels . their sandwiches are usually pretty solid . dessert is hit-or-miss . they used to have awesome hot dogs - order if they come back on the menu ! ! 
pulled pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe - thats all you need to know . one of the best sandwiches in philly , if not number N . i cant really put into words what it tastes like , . its just something that you have to try for yourself . i will warn you though its very messy . tends to get pretty soggy and the roll gives way by the time its all over but its worth it . bottom line if you ' re confused about what to order here , please smack yourself , very hard . 
N stars - for their soup and noodle N stars - for the service
my daughter and i ate brunch at tavern on jane the last day of our first trip to nyc . the food was fine , the atmosphere was great , but the staff was the best . . . . my daughter left her purse there ( with phone ) and we did not realize until at the airport on the way home . after trying numerous numbers to try and track it down , we thought we were out of luck . when we got home to nova scotia , my cell phone rang- it was a staff member calling to tell us that the purse was there . . . they very kindly sent it to us . we are very grateful for the above and beyond service , and since we believe in karma , suggest you go to tavern on jane in the west village when you are in nyc . they deserve all the business and good karma you can give them . . . and tell them the girls from nova scotia sent you ! ! 
i am not sure what gordon ramsey did when he went to leone ' s but i sure worked ! my husband and i had not tried their food in years but decided to order take out last night . the food was absolutely delicious - especially the eggplant rollatini appetizer ( prob one of the best we ' ve had ) . we also had the chicken parm and riviera club sandwiched which were also great . best part was the owner actually made the delivery to our place because they had gotten busy and didn ' t want anyone to wait too long . will definitely be enjoying leone ' s again soon ! ! 
for my first visit to nyc i knew i wanted to do a pizza tour , and i found scott ' s pizza tours on yelp , so i booked it for my boyfriend and myself during our trip . i ' m so glad i did ! joanne was our tour guide , and she was absoutely wonderful . she was full of knowledge about every pizza stop we made , and was genuinely interested in discussing the pizza that we had in whatever cities those of us on the tour were from . i think my boyfriend was a little skeptical of taking a pizza tour , but he had just as much fun as i did , and we are still talking about it ! it is very interesting and a great time saver if you want to try three famous nyc pizza places without having to devote three whole meals to doing it . i highly recommend scott ' s pizza tours to anybody who likes pizza ( so . . . . . . everybody ! ) . it has inspired us to do our own city-wide pizza comparison at home ) next time i go to new york i want to do scott ' s bus tour ! 
went to marty markowitz ' " state of the borough " address with a friend that i always drag to vegan places i want to try . figured this spot was close and well-fitting with the nationalistic ( boroughlistic ) theme of the night . we shared the chickpea nuggets , iron man mob and tapioca dessert . breakdown nuggets were bland and dipping sauce was just mustard iron man was an undercooked flatbread with vegan mayo and steamed kale with a few undercooked shitakes tossed on top tapoica was good but the sugar cookie in it was stale and soggy . the service was good but my friend has a severe nut allergy and when i asked which desserts we could have , the server recommended a cheesecake made with cashews . the atmosphere gets the stars . 
the crab cakes florentine knocked me off my seat . the cakes were crispy but not too heavy . the spinach was filled with yummy feta , and it was all served on a toasted buttery english muffin . the harvest pancakes were something a little different . corn and cranberries gave the dish a kind of savory and sweet combo that was perfect . not to mention tom ' s has somehow created the perfect pancake batter . you could put dandelions in their pancakes and it would be lovely . the biggest drawback , was of course , the wait to sit down . we arrived at Nam on a saturday and were seated within about N minutes . in that time we were given chocolate chip cookies , orange slices , water , and french fries . not bad . please , jesus , let other restaurants start serving their queuing customers snacks ! 
went here today with my family , great choices of food to pick from . chicken was good along with the pork loin and different salads . rice pudding was not that good but chocolate cake and tres leche cake was amazing ! will definitely come again . . . definitely cannot beat the price ! 
my visit to risotteria inspired me to join yelp . . . we had to wait a bit , not a surprise for such a small restaurant . fine the hostess that greeted and sat us was incredibly friendly our server was a good looking guy , super friendly as well the food was pretty tasty so why the N stars you ask ? well as we are leaving there are two men screaming at each other right outside the door . . . so i stop and listen because i am nosey like that . . . and it seemed to a manager or owner screaming at one of the employees . . . umm really ? right in front of the restaurant . that is tacky . 
came here for dinner , sat outside on the patio . byob . great food , decent service considering they were running in and out . nice setup . quiet . recommended .
