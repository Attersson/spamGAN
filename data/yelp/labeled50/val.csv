927,927,927,927,29884,209601,3672,4/28/2008,"just got home from my first meal at this brand new restaurant in west hartford ' s blue back square . tonight was it ' s official opening night so when the waiter announcing the N fresh pasta maker was broken came as a bit of a surprise . upon walking in , first impressions are impressive . a large , open space mixing metropolitan high ceilings and decor with tuscan warmth and rustic details . they also presented us immediately with complimentary wine and cheese meat tasting . very smart way to educate the customer to the italian only wine list and the overall traditional rustic cuisine concept of the restaurant . we did book a reservation , so waiting for a table was annoying , however the tasting was a distraction . after not super long we were walked to our table which was in the back room section of the restaurant . the decor felt more forced than the rest of the place . like it was an afterthought kind of room with a wine rack on one side , very tall ( drafty ) windows on the other and a photo mural of wine barrels covering the back wall . it felt a bit "" chain "" style . like a panera or something . ( ok not quite that bad ) on to the food . they brought bland room temperature bread to the table with a lovely herbed olive oil to dip it in . we were a table of N so the dipping bowl was awkward to deal with . we ended up each messily pouring the oil onto our bread plates . peppered and salted it was a decent starter , although as a whole the presentation was lackluster . tuscan bread should be an experience ! this felt like not a lot of care was put into it . there was more care in the folding of the napkin cradling the bread than the bread itself . and they need a better system for the oil . the quality of the olive oil is fantastic . amazing texture and lightness . but the added herbs did not make much of a flavor statement . salad greens were enjoyed by all , except the orange and fennel salad had a culinary school vibe . like the cook just discovered fennel and will treat everyone else like they have never tasted it . very amateurish . the quality of ingredients again was very high however . a friend said the salted cod mashed potatoes were fantastic , although not something he couldn ' t easily make at home . the entrees were eh on all accounts . it sucks when you don ' t feel like finishing your meal . i had the organic salmon with asparagus and farro . sounded simple to me ! again , quality was fantastic . the salmon was everything it should have been . the farro and asparagus obviously good quality but the combination of flavors missed the mark . was it too buttery ? i don ' t even know , it just wasn ' t awesome , and for N it should have been . also there were only a few slivers of asparagus . i ' m saying , load it up ! here ' s the overview pros nice decor friendly service good manager fresh ingredients simple menu cons untrained waitstaff ( non existent wine service ) mediocre food presentation over thought flavors to seemingly simple dishes borderline corporate ambiance bottom line if you ' re looking for amazing and creative italian , stick to bricco . if you have to take the suits out to a business dinner and they wont know the difference , it ' s perfect . if you love fresh ingredients and a metropolitan meets rustic farm fresh feel , check out firebox in hartford . much better food for you buck . hey it ' s brand new place so give it some time to warm up . maybe they can warm up their bread while they ' re at it .

( hint this is the wrong choice ) another waitress comes back with two glasses and room-temperature water in an old bottle . no ice . my husband just looks at it and says , "" could they have made it any more obvious that they just ran this under the faucet ? we ask for a glass of ice , so again , no big deal . we order our appetizers , and they ' re delicious . as the waitress takes our empty plates , she puts our food-encrusted silverware back on the bare table . i was pretty surprised at that one . we then wait about N minutes for our entrees . obviously , the service is unpredictable . now keep in mind , there ' s no bread served at the table , so while you ' re waiting , you ' ve got nothing to nosh on . and you ' re getting pretty hungry seeing and smelling everyone else ' s food go by . we ' re by the window . . . wouldn ' t it be nice if the view didn ' t look like route N springfield with all the car lots ? anyway , it ' s almost comedic when the food did arrive , and my petit filet is about an inch wide and four inches long . seriously , this could be a scene from a movie ! well , in all fairness , there was an extremely artistic mashed potatoe swirl alongside the steak . it was at least a hearty tablespoonful , so what the heck am i complaining about ? again , no complaints about the flavor or quality of the food . we receive our dessert rather quickly my banana bread pudding was okay , my husband said his berry tart was overly tart . so , at this point , i ' m noticing how really warm it is in the restaurant . i ask the server about that . he says rather amusingly , "" if you think it ' s hot out here , you should see what the kitchen feels like !

N . some complain that el cortijo is expensive a few of the locals i ' ve spoken with don ' t like el cortijo because each taco costs about N . i ' ve never been able to comfortably eat more than N ( along with guacamole and chips , etc ) . the drinks are about N . if this is way out of your price category , beware . but for those of us who love the food , paying N for lunch or dinner ( not including drinks ) is perfectly reasonable . el cortijo is a great place for foodies or people that appreciate high-quality , local ingredients . case in point . . . the last time i had brunch at el cortijo i had a N cheese quesadilla , containing goat , sheep and cow cheese , accented with pickled jalapenos and toasted pepitas ( pumpkin seeds ) nestled between N soft , organic corn tortillas ( made fresh on site ) . really amazing . i also had a chorizo and a fish taco . both were delicious and so far above the other tacos in town , it almost seems unfair . but not quite . i was sort of surprised to find that the guacamole at el cortijo is actually better than frida ' s ( previously located in stowe before it closed in N ) used to be . at frida ' s they made it fresh at your table with a pestle . el cortijo ' s guacamole contains huge , soft ( but not mushy ) chunks of avocado . it ' s made every morning instead of on the spot . despite this , i like it better . i ' ve been waiting for simple , delicious , low-cost , city-quality mexican food in vermont for N years . it ' s finally here . thanks el cortijo . burlington owes you one .
