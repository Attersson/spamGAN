when my boyfriend and i checked into our room at the omni chicago , we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled , as if kids had been jumping on it . that was just the first of our ' issues ' . the glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them , and i saw a ( dead-thank goodness ! ) roach behind the toilet . we were given the hotel night stay by a friend , so we decided to just deal with it . we ordered some munchies from the kitchen , and the chips were stale , and the dip smelled sour . after coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies , we were able to enjoy our stay--but i would not recommend this place to anyone ! 
the entrance and room was spacious and modern , yet elegant . it was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of chicago . the drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds . indeed , it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots .
