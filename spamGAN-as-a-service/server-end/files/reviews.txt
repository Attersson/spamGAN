I loved the dÃƒÂ©cor. It was very modern, artsy and cool inside. We went for brunch. Sadly, service was slow. I saw tons of employees, just they always seemed too busy to help our table. When we did finally get orders in and food received, the food was disappointing. Too expensive for portions we got, and it wasn't that tasty. Thumb down.
I went to this place on a whim and I am so glad that I did. The ambiance of this place was very relaxing and it was neatly kept. Servers were friendly and even accomodated my request for changing one of the non-vegetarian dish with a vegetarian one. The food tasted amazing and I definetely see myself coming back here.
