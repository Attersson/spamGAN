when my boyfriend and i checked into our room at the omni chicago , we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled , as if kids had been jumping on it . that was just the first of our ' issues ' . the glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them , and i saw a ( dead-thank goodness ! ) roach behind the toilet . we were given the hotel night stay by a friend , so we decided to just deal with it . we ordered some munchies from the kitchen , and the chips were stale , and the dip smelled sour . after coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies , we were able to enjoy our stay--but i would not recommend this place to anyone ! 
the entrance and room was spacious and modern , yet elegant . it was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of chicago . the drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds . indeed , it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots . 
the sofitel chicago water tower , while seemingly a good idea in theory , has many drawbacks . at first glance , it appears quite luxurious and grand , but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked . the hotel is quite tall , coming in at N stories , and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying . the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest , so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed . the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor , but its efforts fall short . the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars . the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city , but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment . the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general . the city ' s traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one ' s stay here . overall , i would not recommend this hotel . make a different choice . 
this has been one of the most pleasurable hotels ive ever stayed at . from the beautiful concourse to the amazing food , amalfi really exceeds its standards . the in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible . i highly recommend this hotel as i will give my stay a N N stars . 
i recently stayed at the talbott hotel for N nights and i could not have been more disappointed . it was a terrible experience . long wait to check into room since room wasn ' t ready even though i arrived way after the check in time . front desk was very rude . was given a smoking room when i had requested non-smoking . room service left a lot to be desired . the food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing . the staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly . had no toilet paper in room . room was very noisy . could hear people next door opening doors , watching tv , talking . the room was very dingy , small and had a musty odor . needless to say i will not be staying here again nor will i be recommending this hotel to anyone else . stay away from this hotel . not worth the money . 
my wife and i booked a room at the hilton chicago three weekends ago , as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel . we were expecting some minutia of luxury . however , this was not the case with the hilton chicago . first , we had reserved a room with a king size bed , but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed . now , we did get a reduced price because of this , but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked . second , we had to change our room key twice . the room keys they used supposedly lost their ' charge ' . this is what the front desk told us . so , we had to go up to our room , find out the key didn ' t work , then come back down stairs get a new key , then get back in . this was highly unprofessional , and they really need to look into their key system . lastly , we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room . we knew this was accurate , but i always check just in case . but two weeks later when i checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card . i had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card . suffice it to say we will not be staying there again . 
stay away from this hotel . a few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend . looking at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the sheraton chicago hotel and towers . they claim ' experience the extraordinary ' and this sounded great . when we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags . the front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks . after waiting N hours for our room we finally can start to relax . well upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming . the front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner . we packed our bags and headed over to ' x ' hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home . 
very disappointed in our stay in chicago monoco . we have stayed many times elsewhere , primarily in washington dc and are accustomed to great customer service , beverages like water or soda at the wine bar , coffee and papers in the morning , help with bags . not only did the chicago monoco do none of these things , the staff was not helpful , either . requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there . you got the feeling you were ' bothering ' people if you asked a question . no bellman , the doorman did not open the door or help with bags . even though we were traveling with a child , i had to request a fish when they did not bring it . really baffling . . as we love the monoco in washington . 
this a great property , excellent location and wonderful staff . everyone was very accommodating and polite . the room i had was on the Nrd floor and was like a suite , with a living area and a bedroom . the living room was spacious , with a plasma tv , a desk and a couch . the beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality . in the closed they placed an umbrella , which came in handy , it rained the whole time i was in chicago . the internet connection is N . N Nhrs . great place , i will return for sure . 
this hotel had a great location , but you can do much better for the money . the hallways smelled of smoke , dirty elevators , furniture in the lobby was thread bare . the staff was very helpful . the room was large , bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered . if you have any allergies don ' t stay here !
