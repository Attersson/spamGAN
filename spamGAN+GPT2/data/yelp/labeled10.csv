17116,1987,6/24/2014,"despite the fact that i ' ve worked just a few blocks away from north end grill for the last two years , i wasn ' t able to make my first visit to the restaurant until recently . that ' s nothing against the caliber of the restaurant few have never heard of danny meyer and the union square hospitality group that he built from scratch . north end grill , opened two and a half years ago , is yet another shining jewel in his empire , located in the same complex as the conrad hotel . while chef floyd cardoz is no longer behind the kitchen N , the restaurant appears to be in good hands under eric korsch , who has experience at picholine and waverly inn , and opened the ( now shuttered ) calliope . entering the restaurant for lunch isn ' t a particularly noteworthy experience the jarring contrast of black against white , the functional layout of a separate bar and dining room , and the minimalistic decor throughout are key indicators that it ' s a heavily skewed towards a corporate clientele . service falls into the same pattern conversations are professional , efficient , and curt on occasion , perhaps a necessity given the area . when deadlines and meetings need to be juggled with power lunches , it ' s oftentimes the best approach . thankfully , the menu still shows bursts of creativity in a number of their dishes , a welcome juxtaposition to the environment . for lunch , we opted for two entrees . first - the hen of the woods mushrooms pizza , which is sliced into sixths , and is an optimal size to share . it ' s topped with a generous serving of hen of the woods mushrooms and melted cotija , a perfect blend of texture , earthiness , and a slight tang from the cheese . the crust leans towards more of a thin crust , but has plenty of chew and substance to support the toppings . i was a little surprised to see the oil residue on the bottom of the plate , though , and a little more salt would have been an appreciated addition . the short rib burger was a surprising standout , despite the fact that it was a touch overcooked . the patty , a mixture of twice-ground short rib , retained plenty of moisture and flavor and was topped with grilled , pickled red onions and a spicy , sriracha-infused mayo . the presence of a handful of lightly fried vidalia onions was a welcome addition , rounding out the requisite spectrum of texture , acidity , and spice . while i typically dislike the use of brioche buns in burgers , the ones utilized here were able to support patty and weren ' t too voluminous . while the dish originally came with a side of fries , we had to order the thrice-fried spiced fries separately . these come in a generous serving , and in addition to being almost perfectly executed ( crisp exterior , a soft interior ) are well-seasoned with a blend of cumin and paprika , as well as a dusting of dried mango powder . it ' s an addicting side , difficult to stop eating until the entire bowl is empty . north end grill is quite misleading . at first glance , it seems to be the stereotypical corporate lunch venue , geared towards expense accounts and time-sensitive meals . looks can be deceiving , though . while the menu leans towards the safer end of the spectrum , each item is given a fair amount of care and a slight twist of ingenuity . while it lacks the warmth and bustle characteristic of many ushg institutions , it ' s by no means a bad thing and certainly , the neighborhood would agree . -- N cardoz left the restaurant at the end of april , citing aspirations to open his own restaurant in india . his tenure with ushg reached N years , thanks to the success of the former tabla .

79460,973,12/4/2011,"i ' ve been to maharlika a few times in the past and was charmed by the cute decor , friendly service and delicious food , but this most recent trip was pretty disappointing on all counts aside from the decor ( still cute as ever ) . the tocino ( the filipino equivalent of french lardons or bacon ) arrived in a soggy wet heap , nothing like the crispy , caramelized , and perfect ever-so-slightly charred morsels that had arrived on my plate in the past . i felt gypped , it was like ordering bacon and receiving braised pork . the meat looked like it had been boiled instead of pan fried . we flagged down a waiter to ask if we ' d received the correct dish . he confirmed that it was indeed tocino on the plate but might taste different because their version contained no msg . the last time i checked , msg didn ' t affect the preparation of the meat itself and wouldn ' t change a fried dish to a braised dish , but the conversation with the waiter kept looping back to the fact that they had no msg . me this just wasn ' t what i was expecting when i ordered the dish . it ' s very different from what we received last time . him well , did you like the tocino last time better or today ' s ? me definitely last time ' s . him wordlessly walks away quickly , never to return having waited tables before , i totally get that the kitchen sometimes has off days that are out of the waiter ' s control . but if a customer tells you the food is not what they expected and they aren ' t happy with it , you don ' t just walk away without a word of apology or offering any alternatives . N stars for maharlika the first couple times i ' ve been there , the garlic fried rice , longanisa are great and i love their creative takes on cocktails . N star for the disappointing food and abysmal response from the waiter this time , which evens out to N stars overall . i really do want to love maharlika and i ' m a huge fan of how it ' s making filipino food more accessible in a nicer environment in manhattan so it pains me to give them N stars for now . in the future i ' d be happy to return and try their dinner dishes , i ' d just be sure to avoid the soggy mess that is their tocino . tip cash only , and they take reservations for dinner but not during brunch hours .

"" . then , the starters came . whilst i was not expecting the world from my scallops and was not at all disappointed in them , probably due to that fact , my husband ' s mushroom goop was another matter . the polenta was thick and gunky , the flavour rather bland and the mushrooms could have been cooked by anyone with a little bit of mushroom chopping , butter melting , frying-pan-cooking knowledge . a little disheartened , but ever hopeful , we awaited our main courses the ( infamous ) basil tomato spaghetti for my hub and the cavatelli braised rabbit , parsnips mint for me . after all the hype regarding the spaghetti we had expected some ground-breaking pasta sauce set to make you weak at the knees and beg the chef for mercy , what we got was something that i - without sounding presumptious - could rustle up in two seconds flat , and have much more flavour and depth to it . my rabbit pasta was fine , but that was all i could say about it , it was also pretty bland and devoid of spices or herbs that really managed to set it off . the desserts were better than the rest of the food and we were all pretty happy with those , as we also were with the wines that our hostess ordered . i ' m very sorry to say , after having been so excited to go to scarpetta and expecting to be given a really wonderful culinary experience , we both came away thinking that if we ' d been paying the bill ( the prices are not cheap of course ) we would not have been remotely happy . as it was , we got a free meal and were left thinking that we are , in fact , a lot better chefs than this guy and feel quite proud of our own culinary skills .

51093,523,5/28/2012,"i look for the positive in every dining experience i have . there was a severe lack of that from my night out at geronimo ' s this past weekend . even though it had some decent points , there was too many other things to set off a severely skewed counterbalance . i will try to point out the good and bad points , and then try to expound upon them afterward . the good - they take reservations and honor them . this helps as they are in a busy section of new haven and finding parking is very hard at night . they have an extensive tequila selection and numerous "" original "" mixed drinks on the menu . the guacamole is very tasty , although lied about on the menu and overpriced . the bad - they automatically add N gratuity to parties of N or more ( i ' ll get into that in a moment . ) their waitstaff are very uncouth and nonchalant about their disdain for their customers out in the open . a lot of the food is overpriced and lackluster . also , they do not use fresh ingredients . i went on a saturday night with N other people . when we arrived N person was running late , so N of us were seated and our drink orders were taken . immediately upon hearing that we had a Nth person on the way , our waitress ' attitude completely changed , presumably ( and correct by the end of the night ) that she was now getting an automatic tip so she didn ' t have to put forth effort or courtesy . N of the N people at the table ordered the same drink , and the waitress decided to coax the other people to change their drink order to reflect the others so that she could just bring a pitcher to the table and "" make it easier "" ( for her presumably since she was not writing anything down at any point of us ordering . ) we ordered the chips and salsa and also the table-side guacamole . now , i ' m not sure if most people realize this , but when you order "" table-side "" anything . . . it is prepared in front of you . the "" fresh "" tortilla chips tasted like burnt popcorn , and the salsa was obviously out of a jar . the guacamole arrived already mixed at the table , and the molcajete that it was placed in was only half full , with the other half stuffed with more chips . i ' ve been to plenty of places that serve table-side guacamole in the past , and this was the first time i ' ve seen such an obvious attempt to overcharge the customers . most of the rest of my party ordered some form of tacos , and i ordered the buffalo nickels . now , when i see something on the entree portion of the menu that consists of a "" trio of burgers "" i though i would be right to expect N slider-sized burgers for the price that is listed . that was far from the case . the N "" sandwiches "" on my plate were literally the same size as the condiment cups that shared the plate with them .

73915,3267,3/30/2009,"try opening a restaurant in west village manhattan , and you ' ll realize in the blink of an eye that cashing in enough bling to achieve mediocre break even margins is a daunting feat , especially in the ultra competitive arena of seafood . a quick glance at fish ' s manifestation and you immediately inquire about its survival in west village , where top-notch ( N zagat rated resturants ) are strategically clustered . perhaps if you manage to discern the big sign outside exhibiting its N dollars lobster feast -N and N N pound lobster , a side of steamers , a corn on the cob and fries , with the option of adding an additional lobster for N - you would sidestep your manhattanite speed-walking pace and sneak a peak inside to peruse the interior for signs of lively seafood fanatics ( if you see a crazy , yet intriguing looking chap , sitting at the bar shredding a lobster in to pieces , look no further , you have found me ) . having heard of the place from a colleague ( i officially give him credit here ) , but not convinced of its relevance due to limited and unsatisfactory reviews online , i reluctantly stuck my curious , ravenous , and nonetheless boyish nose inside and surprisingly came out a new man . fish as the name may hint at , has a reasonable selection of "" fish "" , but in my experience , i entered the restaurant twice with my belly growling , and at both times successfully exited having devoured two N and N N pound lobsters while simultaneously experiencing saliva continuously flowing down my jaw on to my plastic apron ( it has a big red lobster on it N ) . graphic , but appropriate . boy was the saliva glistening and i still naively believe that my enthusiastic display ( visually and orally ) of eating entranced many ambivalent outsiders to step within for a taste . although located around the block from city wide famous pearl oyster bar , fish continues to prosper because it has unparalleled lobster ( should be obvious by now ) and raw oyster deals ( half a dozen paired with an alcoholic beverage for N or something ) , catering specifically to those who want the best bang for the buck and not necessarily the tastiest , freshest and most expensive seafood in the city . note that the deals are seasonal in light of the recession , if you have a few bucks , you have found yourself two free throw shots during a tied game with N second left on the clock . this wonder of new york has access to its own port thus , virtually guaranteeing a fresh supply of seafood without the risk of bottlenecks . i ordered the lobster feast ( N N ) and the lobsters i passionately mutilated were freshly steamed , and maintained the fully cooked , chewy ( but not too much ) texture . snap snap , pick , pick , bite , bite , chew , chew , swallow , swallow - i shamelessly have to admit that i have this methodology down to likes of the quadratic formula . i ate vigorously after dipping the large tails in to the liquid butter and spiking them with tangy lemon juice . the steamers were fresh and satisfying albeit , not the highest quality , which was expected ( here i would like to comment that having an excellent and fulfilling meal is about managing expectations ! ) i also realized that french fries go hand in glove with lobsters , and my impaired judgment ( due to deliciousness of the lobster ) led me to enjoy the fries to the fullest extent possible when it comes to eating fries . i sniped each french fry down one by one . . . cleverly , i sat at the bar both times i went due to quick and easy access to the barmaids waitresses ( this is key when you order your second lobster N , want another glass of wine or need wet naps to wipe your whole body ) , proximity to the hanging television , and unwillingness to sqush my tush in the cramp seating areas - i was convinced i would create a mess and didn ' t want any innocent bystanders losing any limbs . on early sunday morning , Npmish , the place was quite empty , but started filling up to the brim by Npm . the crowd did not appear to be the sophisticated ( eh , so they claim ) le bernandin jean georges regulars , but your neighborhood and or outer borough residents looking for an accessible , tasty and sobering ( quite literally after the previous night ' s drunken stupor ) seafood brunch . the service was effective and efficient ( at least during Npm sundays ) , and i would bet my left pinky that the lovely ladies would recognize me as the "" lobster boy "" upon my next return . don ' t expect this to be a happening "" bar "" ( nothing goes on here and if this is your scene , i have no more to say ) , but strictly a convenient place to quench your thirst for natural lobster , oyster or fish juices . go in and go out - there ' s not much lingering to do as you will find it ' s not a hip , hustle bustle , or warm cozy place . personally , i dare not order anything but lobsters , since i love them to death , yet if the opportunity to try another type of seafood came around , i ' d be more than happy to sample away .

"" ok , fair enough i asked what it came with , in terms of sides , and she looked at me like i was an idiot and said , "" it ' s lobster , sort of a mayo sauce , and a roll . about this big . "" um . not what i asked . at N for mayo salad on a roll , you can at least tell me if it comes with fries . we got the crabcakes and gazpacho as appetizers to share i went with a turkey burger ( and the N add-on of a slice of cheddar cheese ) and my gf went with the tuna burger . i can ' t complain about the appetizers . the crab cakes were tender and not overly full of filler , though they were only about N "" in diameter--fine for an appetizer but again , at N . N , you ' d think they could be a little bigger . the gazpacho was good , with a very tasty pineapple-basil sorbet floating in it . the gazpacho itself had an interesting combination of jalapenos and thai bird peppers just enough to tingle , but i ' m not sure i really wanted the spice in a gazpacho . it ends up reading a little too much like salsa when it ' s missing strong cucumber and fresh pepper notes , which this one was . our water didn ' t get refilled and our appetizer dishes didn ' t get cleared before the runner came out with the mains our waitress was nowhere to be seen . my gf dove into her burger , which she said was moist but not very flavorful . i was hopeful about mine . it came on a very flimsy brioche bun ( a thicker one might stand up better to fillings ) but looked good , with as much color as one can expect on a turkey burger without turning it into a cardboard puck . i couldn ' t even pick up the burger , because everything kept falling off the bun was just too small and far , far too floppy . i ' m used to messy foods , so i put on my game face and tried to saw at my burger with ( butter ) knife and fork . it was an exercise in futility i might as well have been sawing at a piece of cowhide with a blunted spoon . i managed to saw off a small corner piece and gave it a try . the first chew was pure salt i worked my way through it and got some encouraging good-quality-turkey flavor , but then hit the texture dense , hard , and very difficult to get over . i almost never send anything back to the kitchen , but this was unpalatable . no worries , i thought . my waitress will come by , and i ' ll just get a salad instead , or something along those lines . five minutes went by . ten . fifteen . twenty . our waitress bustled back and forth seven or eight times , without so much as making eye contact or glancing at the table . my gf was done with her meal our waitress was chatting with her fellows at the end of the room . the restaurant still wasn ' t full . finally , after about Nmin during which nobody even asked if everything was ok ( clearly not , judging by the uneaten food ) she finally came by to clear the plates and only when she had the plate with my untouched ( save for a sawed-off corner ) burger did she bother to ask , half-turning away , whether something was the matter . i kept my cool i don ' t want to be the asshole making a fuss , even after sitting there with a growling stomach while my server ignores me . i said that unfortunately the burger was too dense and salty . she looked from the burger to me , and said , "" i ' ll see if we can do anything about it . "" you ' ll see if you can do anything about it ? come on , that ' s just bad form . the manager did come over a couple minutes later , and i once more explained . she was very nice , asked if i wanted anything else ( at this point , no ) and took the burger off the bill . our waitress came by to ask if we wanted anything else , while practically throwing the bill on the table . i ' ve had better service at highway rest stops . save your money and go elsewhere . in retrospect , we should have just gone to monk ' s . value for dollar was already poor , but the service really makes this place terrible , and a big step down from what it was before its overhaul .

79017,2675,5/6/2012,"this review is for raymond ' s brunch , which my boyfriend and i look forward to having every weekend . since moving to montclair in february , we were on the lookout for a good brunch spot , and after trying several other local options , we were thrilled to have an almost perfect experience at raymonds . we have since been equally impressed each time we go back and enjoy bringing friends and family who have also been as pleased with raymond ' s brunch as we are . service is friendly , fast and thorough . in addition to your server , there ' s a ton of support staff who are always available , always ready to clear a dirty dish or refill a coffee or water glass . my favorite part about raymond ' s is the attention to detail . examples the perfectly seasoned and sauteed mushrooms they use in their omelettes , the textured , nutty , multigrain toast they use ( never that psuedo "" whole wheat "" toast you will find in many a diner and breakfast joint , , , which to me is just glorified , brown-colored wonderbread ) , the flavorful , fresh coffee--you get individual pots of coffee so you can refill your coffee cup as quickly as you need to . . . even the enormous fresh flower bouquets that are always in the bathrooms add that extra touch that makes raymonds really stand out . my boyfriend always gets the steak and eggs--steak tender , juicy , served over a crisy potato pancake , flavorful chimichurri and topped with eggs cooked to order . ( i always steal several bites ) . . . i have tried almost everything on the menu , the omelettes are great because the ingredients they put inside are seasoned and cooked well , example , the oven-roasted tomatoes and seasoned sauteed mushrooms . they never throw half-cooked , or canned ingredients into their omelettes at the end , as many restaurants do , as if they were an afterthought . . . . honestly sometimes i think restaurants wait til the very end to throw in whatever topping you ordered in your omelette , like "" oh sh ! this was supposed to have tomatoes and onions and peppers , let me toss some in from the salad prep station . . . "" . . . i cannot stand cold , half-cooked , unseasoned vegetables in my omelette ! thank you raymonds for your attention to detail . well this review is getting super long , i don ' t know if anyone is going to even read the whole thing , but as i wrap it up i also want to say raymonds is so delicious that one meal is not enough . not because it isn ' t filling but because we are greedy , and what better time to overindulge a bit than sunday brunch ! after our regular meal , we like to get the pancakes for dessert--- heavenly . crispy and golden on the outside , light and fluffy on the inside . never soggy , dense , or too heavy . served with fresh , ripe fruit . we went twice this weekend and brought guests each time and they were so pleased and can ' t wait to go back . raymonds is one of the best things about montclair ! highly recommended ! more highlights creamy , cheesy grits crispy , buttery , real french toast ! p . s . there is always about a N-N minute wait for weekend brunch but it is worth it !

200101,4689,5/16/2013,"my husband and i had dinner with some friends here a couple weeks ago . since they were springing for a babysitter , i was trying to find somewhere that would be special but still casual and comfortable . this place fit the bill . it caters to the hipster foodie crowd and the menu is priced accordingly but most people were in jeans and the service was very relaxed . unfortunately nothing i had there really wowed me and even though i enjoyed the evening very much due to the company and everyone at the table did like the food , i as a relatively infrequent visitor to nyc i ' d probably try someplace new next time . drinks i don ' t normally do mixed drinks but this seems like one of those "" craft cocktail "" type places so i decided to indulge . i started with one from their "" aperitif "" list . it was called jasmine and it had both campari and gin in it with some lemon and triple sec . i am trying to develop a taste for campari since a bartender told me that a negroni is the perfect drink to have with chilled shellfish . so far , i have been unsuccessful . so , i really didn ' t care for this drink but someone else very well might . my second drink of the night was a celery gimlet . even though gimlets are my drink of choice , this one was quite unlike anything else i have ever experienced . i enjoyed it because it was fresh and light and the green chartreuse gave it a nice herbal flavor but the bartender definitely must have added some ground celery seed or something else to it because the celery flavor was very intense and a bit too much . so , i was pretty disappointed in my drink choices , especially since they were N and N respectively . i ' ve had much better cocktails at places in las vegas or scottsdale for around the same price . appetizers well , we just had to try a "" pot "" since they sounded so interesting and we went with the mushroom one and it was delish ! the mushroom taste was intense but in a natural way ( unlike the aforementioned celery flavoring ) since portobellos have a lot of flavor to them . the whiskey jelly added a smokey sweetness that enhanced the earthy flavor of the mushroom mousse even further in a very pleasant way . my husband was a bit put off by the texture but i think it was perfect spread on the toast points that were provided and even when eaten with a spoon the greens on top counterbalanced the richness nicely . we also indulged in a small seafood tower which was just enough for each of the four of us to get a bit of everything prawns , oysters , and mussels . the quality of the seafood was pretty good , i thought . i am surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about it . entree well after all that goodness i fortunately ordered one of the lighter entrees , the ricotta gnudi . i have never tried gnudi before but it was described to me as naked ravioli so i was expecting it to be softer and cheesier . these had a texture more like gnocchi and really did not taste like ricotta to me . i did enjoy the sauce with the sweet peas . it was a great spring dish . my husband ordered the steak and i tried a bite and it was good as well . he also got a bit of bone marrow on his plate as well which was a nice surprise since i know this is one of their specialties . dessert we all wanted to try their desserts so we each ordered a different one . i had a bite of each and they were all pretty tasty . the cinnamon sugar doughnuts were probably the best of the bunch . smores were good but as expected too sweet for my taste . i ordered the ants on a log ( i was still trying to finish my super-celery cocktail so i thought it would pair well ) . this one was a little odd but i guess they were trying to be quirky . i did like the peanut panna cotta but could have done without the rest . . . they should just put it in a gelato dish and top with some chocolate shavings and be done with it . bill came to N for the four of us but as you can see we ordered quite a bit . it was a fun environment and a great night so i have no regrets .

132713,1920,1/22/2014,"so i tell my story of our two years through the food of amis - a vetri family establishment in the heart of philadelphia . the red table wine of amis , the pork cheek , the strange duck sauce of mr . v ' s pasta dish - and what was great about this place was that every choice i made , aside from the desert , i got . . . slightly wrong , and mr . v got them right . flowing red wine and iced tea is essentially what we are - what we drink when we are given a choice , though he ' ll tell you gin and tonic when operating machinery is not in his near future . i loved the atmosphere of amis - it ' s exactly the sort of place i ' ve been looking for for over a year - a hipster ish sort of feeling , sunken and hidden from unknowing eyes , wood everywhere and darkened by lamps and candlelight . somber and definite , it ' s the place you go to talk about the opera or a dark show , something that just doesn ' t feel right and you need inspiration for the words to come out right . starters were bread and olive oil . his picks came first - salami with pickled onions and pecorino with almond honey . both were good - the salami was especially soft and most and i liked it best . the honey on the pecorino was too sweet for my buds , but mr . v loved both . my goal is to taste everything once or twice and move on , his goal is to devour life itself and leave nothing on the plate . which he did . next were my starters - pork ' s head croquettes and sweetbreads . the sweetbreads , while perfectly cooked , were fried a little on the heavy side , though good nonetheless . the croquettes were too big - they should ' ve been smaller , bite sized , because the inside was so rich that two or three bites per croquette was just too much and overwhelming . i would ' ve paid the same price for a smaller bite in order to enjoy it more . entrees were a duck sausage pasta for mr . v and wild boar sausage for myself . mr . v loved his pasta dish , which is surprising , considering he doesn ' t like pasta much . he felt my wild boar was gamey and too salty , but liked the side of potatoes . i agreed , but didn ' t dislike it - it was hearty and gamey and seasoned a bit overmuch , but enjoyable and delish with the red table wine . i really liked his duck sausage pasta - al dente and warm , not smothered in sauce , hints of spice and flavor , light like a cloud . he got all of his right , i got only some , even with the dessert - i had the waffle with nutella and vanilla semi freddo , he had the carrot cake . he liked his , i loved mine , but mine had nutella - it ' s hard not to like it . the parking was odd - mr . v didn ' t like paying N for valet , but i didn ' t want to walk in the cold for too many blocks . the wait staff was pleasant and not obtrusive , much more polite than i expected . mr . v isn ' t used to sitting so close to people , so that was a small adjustment for him . i ' d go back for an after show outing for a drink and some salami and cheese .

75657,2767,2/24/2011,"this is real chinese food , especially if you stay away from the "" foreign devils dishes . "" i ' m not sure , but i believe the chef is the owner . you ' ll often see him sitting out front when things are quiet , sometimes teaching his kids to read or otherwise being a good family man . when he steps behind the stove , he becomes a wizard . the restaurant isn ' t much to look at-- the theater next door went bankrupt and looks like it was bombed-out , so you might be unsure if chengdu N is even open any more . we were there last night , and i was nervous the recession might ' ve killed it , but it endures thank goodness . it ' s very typical of restaurants in china , including a decidedly casual wait staff . dishes come out as they ' re finished , not in any particular order , and the staff hardly changes over time , unheard-of with most american chinese restaurants . comments here about the poor service baffle me . i guess i ' m used to a casual demeanor from wait staffs in china . now , about the food . when this place opened up , it was very authentic with a large selection of authentic spicy dishes . over time , they have added the "" usual suspects "" of lemon or general tso ' s chicken , lo mein and hot sour soup because they ' re what americans want , and turning away business is commercial death . the good news is these additions are grouped under the "" classic "" banner . the menu is crowded with choices , yet if you look around or ask , you ' ll get a revelation of what the chinese really eat . the szechuan sichuan specialties on the menu are where the chef ' s genius shines through . if you can ' t eat anything spicy , then you probably should go somewhere else don ' t ask picasso to paint-by-numbers . to start with , politely decline the deep-fried noodles and orange "" duck sauce "" the waitress brings obligatorily to western diners , and ask for peanuts instead . it will buy you some street cred with the staff . appetizers aren ' t something we usually eat a lot of , preferring to save our appetites for the main dishes , but the wontons in hot oil are delicious , if quite spicy . the cold dan-dan noodles aren ' t really noodles as we know them , but strips of rice dough with a decidedly gelatinous texture not to my particular taste , yet very authentic . texture is important to the chinese my friend , ken hom the food writer , told me jello sells out in hong kong . the chinese base their eating around meat dishes , fish , veggies and soup , with meat decidedly less-frequent and in smaller quantities than the groaning platters served in restaurants here catering to american preferences . so make sure you focus on the vegetables , consider a soup ( chinese diners often have more than one at a banquet ) , and certainly something seafood . sichuan may be a land-locked province , but that hasn ' t prevented the cuisine there from embracing shellfish , dried fish ( abalone , for example , a hong kong influence ) , etc . veggies first when in season , ask for "" kong shin tsai , "" often called "" water spinach "" or other names in english . it ' s a leafy green vegetable with a hollow stem ( the name means "" empty hearted veggie "" ) that is simply stir-fried in oil and spices . the chinese brocoli is also very good and is usually in season ( not to be confused with western brocoli dishes ) . the julienned potatoes and green peppers are wonderful ( green as in green chilis , but very mild-tasting ) . the saut ed bean thread w . green vegetable is excellent , and the ma-po tofu is meaty , oily and very much traditional home cooking . tofu doesn ' t have much flavor on its own , so it picks up the chillis and stir-fried pork tastes . soups are more-limited , probably because americans don ' t usually eat soup ( other than the "" classic "" wonton variety ) when dining chinese . i like the pork pickled cabbage . in colder months , order one of the caseroles or hot pots . i hesitate to recommend one in particular , since traditionally chinese chefs work from what ' s fresh and in-season , but the dry panned beef ( or lamb ) w . chili is good . don ' t be fooled by the "" dry "" qualifier , this is a kind of spicy stew . for the committed carnivors , the pork chops with salt are a guilty pleasure for me ( called "" cispy spareribs w . salt pepper "" on the menu ) . the szechuan style shredded beef or pork are very tasty . kung pao chicken w . peanuts isn ' t a revelation , but solid and something most americans are familiar with . the trick here is to ask what ' s fresh , ask for guidance , and tell them you don ' t want western-style fare ( if you can handle the phonetics , tell them you want "" dow dee duh zhong gwo fan "" which means "" authentic chinese food "" ) .

87594,1143,3/30/2014,"first off , i would like to say that the food was great . my friends and i decided to try out a new restaurant , so we looked to trusty ol ' yelp , and found this place . we made a reservation , but upon arrival were asked to wait for about another N-N minutes . no biggie . it ' s understandable . sh t happens . the food was great . i would definitely recommend the shrimp appetizer ( forgot the name ) , and the cavatelli was actually quite good , despite someone ' s earlier post about it not being enough . i thought the portion was sufficient , and the flavors were spot on . we also had the kale salad , which wasn ' t anything memorable ( but hey , it ' s a kale salad , so no complaints regarding the salad , if it ' s your thing , then go for it . ) the bread pudding dessert was delicious , and brought me back to my childhood when my third grade teacher used to make us this thing called monkey bread . although , this was a much tastier and much more refined version of the treat i had as a child . it ' s always good to have food that brings you back to a happy place from your past . so , my only complaint about this restaurant is the service . aside from the wait , which i already stated was understandable , the server seemed to disappear for vast periods of time . we were done with our meals and sat around for a good N to N minutes waiting for the server to either come take the plates away or ask us if we would like to see the dessert menu . there was actually a point in time where two of my friends had to start waving in their hands in the air just to get his attention . not only did this happen once , but multiple times . what made it worse was that there were only two other tables occupied in the restaurant . the restaurant seemed to be closing down , but if he had taken the time to come to our table more often , or see that all our plates were empty , we could have been out of there much quicker . there is nothing worse than having to flag down a server , and quite blatantly at that . there was a point in time where my two friends had to literally wave both hands in the air to get his attention . after dessert , we had to repeat the hailing-a-taxi gesture just to get him to bring us the check . i remember when there was a time when tips actually meant something . we still tipped him the customary N , which seemed way more than he deserved . however , sitting there waiting for service really makes me wish people remembered that they are getting tipped "" to insure proper service . "" i hope that the establishment reads this comment and decides to step it up . aside from that , it ' s a great establishment . the food was great , and the ambience was nice as well . i would definitely give this place another try , and would even recommend this place to my friends , if they could work out their service issues .

20108,3491,11/12/2010,"i love chinatown but i may have found a new go-to place for szechuan food . if you enjoy eating spicy food , you will appreciate the szechuan peppercorn . it ' s not just spicy but a fragrant , citrusy flavor that leaves your tongue tingling and numb . han dynasty does offer non spicy food . . . but it ' s like eating chicken at a steakhouse . nothing wrong with it , but their best dishes are the spicy ones . apparently han has an americanized and authentic menu . when we walked in we were given the authentic menu and it wasn ' t until i noticed other tables eating things not on our menu did i realize this . so my review will be based on the "" authentic "" dishes . now a bit about szechuan food . this region of china is known for its bold flavors . szechuan cuisine uses a lot of garlic and chili peppers . han offers quite a few street stall favorites like chicken in chili oil ( ko shui ji ) , wonton in chili oil , and spicy noodles with minced pork ( dan dan noodles ) , etc . . . the above dishes were all seasoned with the same chili oil . our tongues were tingling from the pungent peppercorns but the dishes were so flavorful that we enjoyed the slight torture . we also tried a few of their non spicy dishes . the braised beef noodle soup had a rich broth and the beef and tendons were really soft . i hate how other places have stringy beef or chewy tendons . here everything was cooked to perfection . the scallion pancakes were crispy and delicious . and the bok choy with black mushroom tasted fresh . flavors were clean and right on . if you don ' t like it spicy , stick with dishes that don ' t have the word chili in it . none of the taiwanese or cantonese dishes are spicy so there are plenty of options for everyone . han dynasty does get really crowded so aim to go during off peak hours for some peace and quiet . however , if you like the loud , boisterous , chinese family style kind of dining that reminds you of being in asia , then you will be leaving smiling .

( N ) i was also drooling at the mac and cheese appetizer , it was a huge portion with tons of cheese ! -did i mention i like cheese ! - there was many delicious entrees that made it hard to choose , including pork shank , a stuffed burger with cheese and fries , chicken with rice and beans , and of course since its peruvian they have churasco , which is something my boyfriend and i chose right away , his done well mine done medium . the portions were huge , they give you two large pieces of skirt steak , with N tostones the size of your head , along with sides of rice and beans all for N dollars . the steak came with oil and oregano garlic which i poured a generous amount of , it was the perfect , really made a difference in the seasoning , and the meat itself was pretty juicy . the beans also had a lot of flavor and the rice was cooked perfectly , the tostones were crispy the way i like it . the service itself was a bit slow , i know this place was packed and hectic , and perhaps understaffed , so we only got two glasses of water that night , i asked for ketchup and never got any , and the waitress only stopped by twice , to take our order and to give our bill , but at least she was friendly . the drinks in the place are really good , i really recommend their margaritas , not too much sugar or alcohol , there was a perfect balance , it was a little tangy , i got the skinny version and it still tasted just as a good , but they did put a too much ice in the drink so it got watered down quick the table behind us had a large group of girls who were loud and rowdy , and i feel like the crowd this restaurant attracts certain clientele that tends to be ratchet , but that ' s noneee of my business the table next to us did find another persons hair in their burger , and the manager gladly took care of it right away with no charge making a new burger for my boyfriend they gave him a dessert on the house , between flan and chocolate or tres leches , we chose tres leches tasted ridiculously good and they sang him happy birthday , he was super embarrassed but we had fun , this place made my boyfriends birthday very special , and for N dollars entrees range from N-N , it was totally worth it .

7930,1398,1/23/2010,"i ' m from new york city and normally restaurant week there hardly ever tickles me fancy . when a group of friends wanted to try alma de cuba for restaurant week , i was expecting smaller portions and bad service . fortunately for me , this place proved me wrong . staff was friendly and portions were filling . we were a part of N and we dispersed the menu among us generously . i had the ecuadorian shrimp which was marinated with much flavor and presented nicely , majority of our table ordered that and enjoyed it without recourse . i shared mine with my partner that ordered the royal palm dates . i was not much of a dates person but alas i tried it and i have to say , it was nothing like i imagined . i believe the almonds that were stuffed in there took the herbal smell and taste off the dates and the bacon and blue cheese complimented the piece very well . it also sat on an endive leaf which finished it off very clean . i never thought i would have been able to describe that to such extent . my main course was the panela chilean seabass . i normally enjoy chilean seabass regardless how it ' s cooked , but the way it was made here was so creamy , it literally melted in my mouth . even my partner who normally doesn ' t like it says it is one of the best they had . the pickled cucumber gave a clean flavor to the fish , just as lemon juice would have done , but the use of the cucumbers , made it more distinct in my opinion . i nibbled off the cuban shrimp enchilado and found it complimenting as well . the tomato and pepper stew gave a good kick to the rice . i also had pieces of the vaca frita "" fried cow "" , and although it wasn ' t as good as the other two , it wasn ' t horrible either . my company did state that it was either too salty or sour . it might be because i didn ' t eat majority of it , so i didn ' t notice it . to finish we had a choice of the coconut tapioca pudding or the traditional caramel flan . my first flan experience wasn ' t a great one , so i opted for the pudding . i liked the tapioca pudding a lot , but chose to set the roasted pineapples to the side . it didn ' t like the mix as much as i thought . then i took a bite off the flan just to try it , and i enjoyed it very much so . originally , i thought it was a tad on the sweet side , to find out later , maybe i should have spooned it with the pomegranate . . . yea , that made it a whole lot better . to wrap things up , service was very attentive without being in your face . they cleaned off your table accordingly and if you got up to use the restroom , they folded back up your napkin respectfully , all this without staring you down or hovering . it is a great date spot without having to be too proper , but they still do have a business casual dress code . this was a very enjoyable experience for me and i would not mind returning , wallet permitting that is .

N . the cockroaches i ' ve never personally seen a cockroach inside jose tejas , and , being a nervous sort of person , i ' ve definitely looked . being that i live so close to the establishment , though , i ' ve known numerous people who were employed at the restaurant during their high school or college years . one of my friends , whenever she was questioned about cockroaches , would say nothing . another one of my friends , though , was more vocal "" my dear , why do you think the food is so cheap ? of course there are cockroaches !

138124,2034,1/13/2010,"i was down from boston visiting friends in philly and we went to parc on two separate occasions over the weekend . the first was a late dinner dessert on friday night . i had a sandwich on the train and wasn ' t too hungry , so i ordered the beet salad with greens and roquefort cheese . i asked to sub goat cheese for the roquefort ( too strong ! ) and the waitress was perfectly happy to accomodate me ( no nasty looks ) . my friends got french onion soup ( looked amazing with an insane amount of bubbling cheese ) , cheeseburger , and macaroni gratin . we also got the house white wine carafe which was just about a glass each of the N of us . we split two desserts the apple tart which was heavenly though i don ' t usually go crazy over fruit desserts and the profiteroles . profiteroles were great because they were four tiny bites ( perfect for our group ) . i ' m not usually a profiterole fan ( i don ' t get the puff pastry thing ) , but the dark ( bittersweet ? ) chocolate sauce they drizzle is excellent . next was sunday brunch . another comment on their excellent service our group of N was seated at a table where the floor was markedly warped ( we ' re talking huge bump ) and it was really uncomfortable to sit there ( where to place the chairs , the table , etc . ) . we asked our server if we could change tables ( the restaurant wasn ' t busy yet at N N am ) and thinking he would sneer at us , he checked out the floor and totally agreed that it would be awkward to sit there and moved us promptly . our server also suggested the pastry basket one butter croissant , one chocolate croissant , one blueberry muffin , and one raspberry danish , which we all divied up . it was great ! the only complaint i had was we didn ' t also get their complementary bread basket ( which is really good as well ) and i saw another table get both so i was bummed ( hey , i like bread , okay ? ) . our brunches were only mediocre in my opinion though . i ordered the croque madame which is ( i didn ' t know ) a fried egg , ham , and mornay sauce ( a tangy cream sauce ) on a piece of brioche . they drowned the thing in mornay ( maybe i just don ' t love creamy sauces ) but the ham was excellent . hoping for breakfast potatoes or a more interesting side , all i got was greens again ( i do realize that this review is totally making me sound like a fatty , but fine , i like to eat ! ) . my friends who ordered the omelette got only greens as well . in sum - excellent pastries desserts ( typical of a french bistro ) and excellent service ( maybe not typical of a french bistro ) but only so so other items . would like to come back for a full dinner and re-evaluate .

9416,3567,9/15/2012,"i spent a lot of time in chinatown in my younger days , and one of the "" go to "" spots in the area for a quick , reliable bite was big wong . i have incredibly fond memories of my parents taking me there and getting me traditional dishes like congee with deep fried dough to dip in , or the occasional dinner ( which i always found to be special since we mostly went there for lunch ) with wonderfully cooked noodles or vegetables . fast forward many years and i still go to big wong regularly when i need a relatively inexpensive , satisfying and tasty lunch . the facade has changed of the years , as has the interior . there ' s a lot of brick work in the front and the interior is mostly dark wood furniture with red colors all about ( the traditional chinese color of luck ) . the walls have a mish mosh of paintings and menu offerings . it definitely still has the charm of an old skool chinatown establishment , but the place is kept clean and comfortable ( trust me , about twenty five years ago it was a different story ) . the service is fast , gruff and most of the time you ' re lucky if a waiter even has a chance to check on you during the meal . they ' re usually jam packed and the waiters are running around like chickens without their heads . your best bet is to flag a waiter down if you need something , not wait for them to come to you ( and i count half a star against them for this since so much of their clientele is now tourists , who aren ' t used to this sort of treatment ) . i ' ve had a lot of different things here , but here are the three things i have most often to give you an idea about the food congee ( with salted pork , century egg , ginger and scallion ) congee , for the uninitiated is basically a porridge of sorts created using rice instead of oats . this rice base can be combined with almost any savory ingredient to create a bowl of deliciousness . my personal favorite is the version with salted pork , century egg ( en . wikipedia . org wiki ce ) and scallions and ginger . it ' s a very simple dish but it is hearty , thick ( almost like a stew ) and absolutely delicious . it ' s fresh made , so it ' s always served piping hot and the heat really helps the flavors of the other ingredients soak in . if you really want to go into carb overload , order the fried dough ( it looks like a deep fried , golden cruller ) . there are two versions , one plain and one with a crusted layer of sugar on top . either one goes really well with the congee . wonton soup ( with egg noodles and scallion ) another warm , comfort dish . egg noodles are served in a beautiful chicken broth with scallions added in for flavor . the wontons are a mixture of pork and shrimp and are perfectly sized for two bites of deliciousness ! dash some white pepper in ( provided at each table ) for some awesome "" kick "" . roast pork made in a sweet style , this dish is best when the outside is a deep red and glistening and the interior has small layers of fat in it to give it an extra satisfying texture and flavor . however , big wong loses another half star because on occasion the roast pork can be a bit dry , but N of the time it ' s awesome . honorable mentions go to their lobster ( two for N with a ginger scallion sauce ) , roast duck ( totally delicious and fatty ) and their beef with broad noodles , which is one of my favorite dishes ! big wong is a chinatown institution and definitely deserves a visit from you !

' nuff said . and the food is typical volume over quality . just put huge mountains of fried seafood and french fries in front of some people and they ' ll think it ' s fabulous , regardless of the quality . if you want "" the best "" fried seafood , go to cape cod or even the sea swirl in mystic . i often wonder why there is no legal seafoods in connecticut . i have been to them in ny and nj and recently went to one in boston and was blown away . now there ' s a seafood restaurant worthy of being called "" the best "" . connecticut needs a restaurant like that . something really worth that title has to grab the attention away from this place . it ' s making us look bad to outsiders when other areas have much better seafood . i honestly cringe when i think that any new englanders would think the chowder pot is "" the best "" . they haven ' t had the best by any means if they think this is the best ! perhaps it gets called the best because there ' s not much else to compete with it in this area , but even so , they are doing their state a disservice by giving this mediocre place such a great reputation . unfortunately i have been to the chowder pot on several occasions , having been dragged there by friends and co-workers in the past . every time i have been there the place looks worse and worse , and i have even seen people walking in dressed in pajamas ! yuck ! oh for the days of the clam box when i was a kid . . . . . i would rather drive to the shore at N N a . m . in a snowstorm than settle for what my husband and i call "" the chowder slop "" .

58269,636,7/8/2014,"recommended by friends ( who joined me on my trip through philadelphia ) , rangoon looks like a "" typical "" asian place in chinatown from both the outside and the inside , but the food is very good . the staff was helpful and attentive . i had the delicious village style soup and we shared a number of appetizers ( the golden triangles are very good , and their dipping sauces are unique without being overpowering ) . one companion observed that her tofu didn ' t look like tofu - it had an odd color and shape - but she said it tasted great , so it ' s just prepared in a different manner . i am not someone who generally likes southeast asian cuisine - or , rather , i usually only find one or two dishes that i want to try since i don ' t eat seafood and avoid a lot of other common foods from this region . but the menu at rangoon is extensive and i could probably go back for a week and not order the same thing more than once . the chicken mint kebab entree was solid and filling , and i also tried a bite of the pumpkin chicken - pumpkin is not really my thing , but it had a nice heartiness to it and my other friend cleaned his plate , and i was glad to try it . there are many vegetarian vegan options , and one friend said that they had even made her vegan N layer bread on a previous visit . i should also say that i was traveling with luggage and had to meet three different sets of friends ( i am not in the city all that often ) , and one couple had a baby , and the staff never blinked an eye and were totally accommodating . parking can be tough - it ' s chinatown - but it ' s worth the visit . one group of friends had recently moved from texas and they all said they loved it , it was their first time with burmese food .

170088,2741,9/29/2014,"the chef ' s table has listened ! that is the most significant finding of my experience at the chef ' s table last saturday night . nobody of sane mind would question , argue or debate the intense quality , taste and presentation of the food served here . i can ' t remember finding one review that said otherwise . so my review will not focus on what should be uncontested , the amazing food experience you are sure to have ! instead i want to focus on what many people did have issues with the sommelier , server , and more frequently . the chef himself . i am happy to say , those issues are being contested ! i was lucky enough to score a gift certificate to eat here from a very dear friend as a wedding present . what a great wedding present right ? so prior to going i did a lot of homework reading the last year ' s worth of reviews from fodders , tripadvisor , and here not to mention many critics ' reviews . a common thread emerged from the many of the reviews , the service ! stuffy , cold or rude wait staff , no explanation of the dishes , no photos allowed , and then there ' s the chef . whether he was unfriendly , didn ' t like playing host , didn ' t engage with the patrons even though this is the ' chef ' s table ' , or just being mean there were many people saying the same thing . i even recall reading two separate reviews where as patrons were leaving , the chef stood there at the door not saying a thing and presumably waiting for them to thank him . so i was pretty worked up on the way there , running through my head that if i witnessed any of this , i was going to address it . after all there was no way i was going to let a wonderful wedding present like this be tainted by a diva chef that can ' t get out of his own way . but just the opposite happened ! the sommelier was a pleasure , and when i told him my plan of starting with champagne , them move on to white and then to end with red , he gave timing of when to make the transition and offered suggestions along the way . he was overly friendly and sweet ! the server was just great ! i cannot see anyone having a problem with her ! she explained every dish , even though we were almost last in the line , was friendly , and actually really personable . we were chatting her up throughout the meal , and instead of being short and just giving half-friendly smiles , she engaged in conversation with us . she really added to our dining experience ! and then there is caesar . he made sure to say hello to everyone , my husband and i separately in fact , and it was one of those hand on the shoulder warm hellos too . now granted , he actually ended up having a full on conversation with every couple there but us . i didn ' t hold that against him though because my husband and i were in full on conversation the majority of the meal and enjoying ourselves . i didn ' t feel the need to have a conversation with him just for the sake of it . however , watching him work the room was nice to see ! now don ' t get me wrong , i would probably tend to agree with the people who say we should lower our expectations of chefs , and that they usually aren ' t the best playing ' host ' . we want them to cook well , and chef certainly does ! but even if he wasn ' t N into it , he played the game , and i thought pretty well . all in all , all of the complaints made of this place i think have been for the most part , resolved . however , i have come up with some different ones first , where we were sitting , we were listening to the dishwasher the entire evening . i get it that they have to clean the dishes , and being we were the last seating they probably didn ' t want to be there all night after we left . but i have to say it was distracting ! they will be renovating the space soon , please take care of this ! also , there was sorbet and three dessert courses , all of them being ice cream . i was looking for some cake or pastry of some sort , so the all-ice cream thing was a surprise . i was also surprised that there was no cheese course . i normally don ' t look forward to these courses , but for whatever reason this time i was . small things to complain about in an otherwise amazing dinner ! the first four sashimi courses and the wagyu beef was the most amazing thing i ate all night . all in all , don ' t let the previous negative reviews prevent you from experiencing a meal everyone needs to have at least once ! maybe twice if you are lucky !

N stars this time , versus N last time . ) i ordered several vegetable antipasti dishes beets , fennel , fried cauliflower , and the slow roasted parsnips to share . for my entree , i went for the brook trout , again . the vegetables for the most part were excellent ( especially the cauliflower ) . however , everyone at my table was in agreement that the parsnips were over salted . this was disappointing as they would have been incredible had they not had such a heavy hand with the sea salt . i had a bite of the sardi pasta again , which was as good as i ' d remembered . the texture was just impeccable . as for the brook trout , not as much attention was paid to it as last time , it seemed . the thinly shaved garlic did not garnish the lemon slices this time . the biggest disappointment was that the texture of the bottom half of the trout was a bit mushy . perhaps it was just frozen from the night before , as it was a sunday evening . for dessert , we ordered the four twenty blackbirds pie of the day a chocolate , oat , and pecan pie . crispy oatmeal was on top of a layer of chewy , sweet pecans . beneath the pecans was a small layer of chocolate ganache . this was served with some of the best whipped cream i ' ve ever tried . the pie was reminiscent of a freshly baked , chewy , chocolate chip oatmeal cookie . so good . i will be back to rucola again , though probably not on a sunday . hopefully if will be more consistent on the busier nights , as i was super excited after my initial visit , having found my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood . update i ' ve returned to rucola several times and have had nothing but great experiences since . also , i ' ve got to mention they have an awesome wine selection , , and the new rider was one of the best drinks i ' ve ever had !

N . you are selling more than just food ( i hope ) , so do make eye contact when you put food in front of people - that ' s the least you can do if you can ' t crack a smile to go along with it N . when someone asks you for a to-go box for the food they couldn ' t finish , don ' t look so obviously annoyed and say that you will "" do your best "" to box it for them . the food was paid for and it should not matter whether the customer eats it there or somewhere else . N . how you still get some many customers having a cash-only policy is a mystery . however , coins are still considered cash , last i checked . when a customer tries to leave you a tip by putting a few quarters in a mix , you shouldn ' t fret about it- money is money , period . if your establishment doesn ' t accept coins , make that clear on your menu website .

101316,2014,7/11/2013,"i had an unpleasant experience at escape . first of all , when you walk into a restaurant that touts local food sourcing you don ' t expect to see red and white peppermints in cvs wrappers at the hostess stand nor do you expect coca cola to be on the drink menu . but having said that i was open to experiencing wonderful dining . i recently moved to montclair and have had the pleasure of dining out a bit and have been mostly wowed with the restaurants . greek delight was the only restaurant i did not really like out of nearly N i tried . back to escape . . . our waiter was nice but lacking in experience and the maitre d ' was neither helpful nor gracious . the smoke alarm sounded for nearly one half hour in the middle of our meal and during this time all we got was some bread with no explanation . it was a little surreal . it was like the elephant in the room that the staff was doing their best to ignore , but couldn ' t . prior to the interruption we were served our first courses . i had ordered the prix fixe meal and my friend ordered a la carte . we started with bread which was neither here nor there a couple of slices of something unremarkable paired with a couple of very small pieces of cornbread . i don ' t remember what my friend ordered so i won ' t speak to her experience . the scallop dish , which was either my first or second course , was quite good . while small it was not out of line with what i would expect in a multi-course meal . but it went way downhill from there . as i mentioned before , we endured blaring noise for nearly a half hour only to wait for another half hour for our entrees . i ordered the pork chop , which when served , was tepid at best and way overcooked and dry . the touted ingredient which i believe was a wild mushroom , maybe a morel , was barely present . when it came time for desserts , i asked if i could get the cheese course , after all , it was bobolink whose cheeses i adore . i even had some in the fridge at home . the maitre d ' said it could not be included with the prix fixe meal . it was i believe N when the other desserts were N , but don ' t quote me on the prices . at this point , i looked at him and said , "" really ? "" he begrudgingly relented , it didn ' t feel good . to add insult to injury , the cheese platter arrived with pieces of cheese that must have been left out unwrapped for a week . they were inedible and most unreflective of bobolink and kind of disrespectful to me , as well . the maitre d ' could have made everything right by simply offering to include a slightly more expensive dessert to compensate for our less than stellar experience . had he done that , i would have left with a good feeling and maybe a willingness to try escape again , but he didn ' t . one last thing . i got the feeling the communication between the front and the back staff of the restaurant was not good . towards the end of the meal there was a ruckus in the kitchen . it sounded like it had gotten out of control . so that ' s it . i was disappointed . i really looked forward to the meal . i love restaurants that promote local growers , but you can ' t win every time . postscript the day after the meal was mother ' s day and i was in whole foods buying flowers . in front of me stood a man in a chef ' s outfit . i overheard him talking to the woman in line in front of him . he introduced himself as the chef from escape . i probably missed an opportunity to speak to him directly , but i didn ' t want to bother him .

15321,3207,8/2/2014,"i ' ve had good bbq in connecticut but bear ' s is king . i first had a taste of their incredible pulled pork at an event several months ago and declared it the best pulled pork i had ever had . i wasn ' t exaggerating . i went to the windsor location shortly thereafter and enjoyed more fantastic pulled pork among other delicious menu offerings . i came to this brand new hartford location for lunch yesterday ( open for less than a week ) and bear ' s does it again . mindblowingly good bbq that i am still thinking about the day after . the hartford space is vastly different than the windsor location . while the current windsor location ( construction is underway for a new and larger location in windsor opening in the near future ) is fine but looks outdated and lacks ambience , this location is new and clean with a rustic modern feel brought on by the presence of steel and wood . the masculine energy is strong . it ' s much larger , spacious , airy even , with a loft-like second level . decor is simple but tasteful . i loved it . whenever i ' m at bear ' s i always think about trying something other than pulled pork , like brisket , burnt ends , chicken . . . but i also know that i would regret not getting pulled pork so that ' s what i always happily end up with . for the two sides i chose mac and cheese and broccoli salad . the mac and cheese is different here than at windsor . windsor uses elbows and had slightly cheesier and thinner sauce , here they use spirals with a thicker more mild sauce , but both are great . i foresee choosing two sides to be a difficult task in the future as i have loved all the ones i ' ve tried so far ( the two mentioned here and the smoked bbq beans ) and i still have yet to try the mashed sweet potato or the hand cut fries . the cornbread was excellent as ever . best , best cornbread . by the time i had arrived for lunch around Npm they had sold out of the pecan pie and peach cobbler for dessert , but had apple crisp . the apple crisp is phenomenal . there are few things i make that i believe to be boastworthy , but my apple crisp is one of them . bear ' s is as good if not better . i was completely blown away when i heated it up a bit and paired it with vanilla bean ice cream after i got home . they ' re currently working on having whipped cream and or ice cream to pair with their desserts in the restaurant . another thing they ' re working on at this time is the parking situation . they ' re working with with the garage across the street to be able to validate parking in the future , but until all that is sorted out patrons will have to pay to park in the garage . for now customers who pay to to park in the garage can receive a beverage on the house ( just bring your ticket with you ) . just yesterday arch street tavern , right next door , put up an unfriendly unneighborly sign in their parking lot stating , "" arch street tavern parking only , not bears "" . not nice . lastly , the customer service here is top-notch . every employee i encountered was pleasant and helpful . one is example they had run out of forks when i went up to get one . i notified an employee and she brought me one after refilling the dispenser ( it worked better than using a spoon for pulled pork ) . when i thanked her she replied with a genuine smile , "" no problem . it ' s my job .

24482,1360,10/2/2007,"i read a lot about public , a restaurant near little italy and the bowery , and decided to take v there to celebrate our first year together . it was a great choice we had a truly unique meal with great service . it is hard to describe what ' kind ' of restaurant public is , even on their website the food is described only as "" free-spirited fusion . "" i ' d say it is australian new zealand-ish cuisine , which is definitely something new to me ( though it is a bit similar to american and european ) . we started our night in the monday room , next to the restaurant , it is a wine bar featuring N wines from around the world . the menu itself was cool , with , i believe , a kangaroo-fur cover . we had a interesting sommelier , with an accent , a handlebar mustache , thick-rimmed glasses and a three-piece suit . v was convinced this whole get-up was an act , because the accent was indistinguishable , and his look was so peculiar . i couldn ' t put my finger on it either , but overheard him say he was from spain , which , to me , seemed reasonable . if we go back we ' ll have to see if he ' s changed to being from romania or something with a new costume and a different mustache . anyhow he was very friendly and helpful in guiding our wine choice . i ordered a great bottle of spanish wine , via pedrosa , that i thought was amazing . i ' m no wine connoisseur , but it was smooth and full and rich , all things i like . all together the service was top-of-the-line - they even offered to take the flowers i had for v and put them in water for her . dinner at public the view from our tablesoon , the hostess from public came to seat us . we had a nice table in the main dining room where we could sit side-by-side and see the whole space . before arriving we had checked out the menu so we had a few ideas in mind for what to order . there are quite a few unique and exotic dishes to choose from . i ' m lucky v is adventurous ! to begin with , we selected another bottle of wine , public has a separate wine list than the monday room . i can ' t remember the vintage , etc but this was another great bottle . then , for starters we ordered cured wild boar with garrotxa cheese , marinated olives and caper berries . this was thin slices of meat , kind of carpaccio-style , but it was cured so it had a rich flavor that was great with the cheese . it was not too large , which is good for a starter but at the same time it seemed a little pricey . grilled kangaroo on a coriander falafel with lemon-tahini sauce and green pepper relish . this was great . i ' ve never had kangaroo before ( nor boar ) , and the meat was tender and juicy . the relish was a bit spicy but getting a little bit of it in each bite added a nice kick . the falafel added a nice texture and some more subtle flavor . we both really enjoyed the dish . on to the main courses , which were also rather unique , if not quite as exotic . i ordered the roast lamb sirloin on crispy goats cheese polenta with saffron braised baby vegetables and harissa aioli . here the meat had great flavor but was a little tough . i really enjoyed the polenta , which was kind of compressed into a ring and served under the meat . the vegetables were nice but nothing amazing , little carrots and onions , etc . v ordered the roast new zealand venison loin , with cabrales dumplings , oyster mushrooms and salsa verde . lucky her , i kept wanting to try more of this , as it was definitely our favorite . the meat was just great , very flavorful and tender and cooked just right . of course mushrooms are always a good thing , and the dumplings added some starch to the plate . honestly , i know we had dessert , but after two bottles of wine and a digestif ( good scotch ! ) i can ' t remember what i chose . i ' m pretty sure there was some chocolate , and maybe a caramelized drop of sugar . . . it was good ! and indeed , public was a perfect place for us to celebrate not too formal , great food , and great service all around--plus they have little bars of soap in the bathroom that you can take home ! we we ' re even considering going back just two days later .

95630,2362,3/28/2013,"i had a great experience at hiro ramen recently . it was a cold , rainy day and a friend and i decided that ramen was perfect food to counteract the weather . the place can be a little hard to find since the only sign for it is in kanji , but at the same time that contributes slightly to its authentic feel . the decor within is simple and nice , but what i noticed most upon entering was how empty the place was . it was Npm on a monday , so not the busiest time for a low-key affordable restaurant , but i still found the lack of customers surprising . the menu is very simple - there are four options , and the waiter informed us that they now had "" spicy "" variations available for two of the broths . each broth comes with a certain number of toppings built in , but you can add more for about N each . the extra dollar is worth it if you add an egg ( really , almost a necessity in ramen ) , but seems a little absurd if you order seaweed , as you get a single piece of nori ( approx . N "" xN "" , just getting two or three pieces would feel more reasonable to me ) . they also have an assortment of imported japanese drinks ( note the blended coffee can is very small , also sometimes exactly what one is in the mood for ) . i had the spicy miso and sampled my friend ' s tonkotsu , the short version is both were delicious , and very distinct . the tonkotsu had a sweet , creamy flavor , and the spicy miso was the perfect spiciness and saltiness ( for me , at least ) . that is to say it was distinctly spicy ( and enough to keep my friend from stealing much of my broth ) , but not spicy enough to force me to slow down or keep me from consuming the entire bowl . the pork soaked up the miso broth really well ( and the tonkotsu broth nearly as well ) , and was very tender . i enjoyed the bamboo in the broth , but my favorite bite was the halved egg - definitely the top recommendation for additions . so the short version is that the food was tasty , affordable , and quickly delivered , and i am certain to be back .

20986,1526,4/2/2011,"this is a review of carlo ' s tasting menu - full thoughts in my blog with highlights below . starting with a bit of back story , i ' ll admit i would be lying if i claimed to have discovered roberta ' s on my own - the blog whispers had become a hum even prior to my february visit to the big apple and the moment i heard i would be returning to new york in march i made contact about the restaurant-within-a-restaurant experience from chef carlo mirarchi . pleasant and prompt my first e-mail was handled by cherie burnett and the "" rules "" were explained - N-N people , arrive by N N , and N- N per person - simple enough , i ' d say . with a date agreed upon i ' d never hear from cherie again - from this point forth it would instead be a back and forth string of e-mails between myself , my co-diners , and chef mirarchi himself discussing likes , dislikes , and so forth - an impressive display of customer service on par with past experiences with restaurants garnering three stars from michelin . course N the first of many breathtaking courses of the evening - on the surface somewhat surf n ' turf , but far more subtle and complex . centered by a perfectly seared ( ie caramelized outside , raw within ) diver scallop caught and shucked that very day , the sweet bivalve was balanced with a shaving of headcheese - gamey , unctuous , and fatty . with the duo tasty on its own , the true beauty of the dish was in the details - specifically a slice of red onion and fresh squeezed tangerine juice that lent an acidic and sweet levity to the whole plate and acted to meld the two proteins into a stellar bite . course N presented by carlo as his favorite of the night - he even took time to show us a picture of the fish pre-filet on his iphone . presented as sea perch with ramps , yuzu , and firefly squid the fish itself was mild and buttery with intensely crispy scales that particularly thrilled my co-diner who ' d noted just the night before that he loved crispy skin on his fishes . paired with beautiful early season ramps , tiny squid with plenty of bounce , and sweet lemon tones the dish was fish done right - the sort of thing you ' d expect to emerge from the kitchen of le bernardin , or given the crisp skin perhaps guy savoy . course N still wobbly and extremely creamy , poached duck egg with morels , dill , and bread crumbs was all one could desire from an egg dish and given the accoutrements a perfect entry to spring . served with the whites barely set and creamy yolk pouring forth with minimal pressure from the fork i loved earthy fiber of the morels , the crunch of the bread crumbs , and the faint accent of the dill - again , no special tricks , just an exemplary preparation of quality ingredients . our tenth course of the evening was an encore to the seventh - the rest of the squab , feet and all - served with mascarpone , gooseberry and sorrel . crispy skin , rosy flesh , a thin ribbon of fat - the squab breast was perfect and the legs surprisingly meaty . to be fair i honestly don ' t remember the rest of the dish all that well - probably because i was too busy eating the leg by hand , something i ' m rather certain i ' ve never done during a "" tasting menu "" before but felt entirely justified ( and comfortable ) doing at roberta ' s . course N presented first in its raw state at the beginning of the meal , then whole-cooked , and finally plated , the N-day dry aged wagyu with fingerling potatoes , sweetbreads , and ramps was nothing short of a revelation . ignoring the potatoes , sweetbreads , and ramps - all things i love and all prepared exquisitely - the wagyu itself was hardly "" beefy , "" the flavor instead somewhere between butter , mushrooms , and nuts while the texture was literally melt-in-the-mouth - the sort of meat that could be cut as easily with the edge of a fork as with a knife , and a portion so generous that my dining partners took a good N ounces home . in a word , it was perfect - the sort of dish i will remember for a long time to come not only because it was delicious , but because it challenged and changed a long held belief . sitting and sipping our coffee while chatting with our server and later with carlo i was perhaps at my happiest - full of great food and drinking coffee with friends while listening to led zeppelin in the presence of a gracious host - a moment , much like the meal , that i won ' t soon forget . with the bill settled - a veritable bargain at N per person - and carlo walking us to the door it was a quick trip via subway back to manhattan with much chatter about the wonderful experience just passed - an experience i can ' t wait to revisit on my next trip to new york and an experience i would suggest anyone who values great food and great people check out for themselves before the "" secret "" that is carlo mirarchi and roberta ' s is out and reservations become unattainable .

N the pork with garlic sauce was available to come atop rice or noodles . the noodles were clearly hand-crafted and simply amazing . it ' s a bit cumbersome to eat for date night , so i ' d advise you not to wear a crisp white shirt . but the noodles are definitely worth it - the texture and the way it holds the garlic sauce is simply superb . and the tender pork combined with baby bok choy and celery ? savory , sweet , and texture abounds . shanghai wonton noodle soup N . N this isn ' t your americanized chinese food joint ' s won ton soup . the broth is clear and deep . the wontons are well-crafted and large , filled with abundant portions of pork . not overly salty , this soup will fill you up for under N . stewed chicken over rice N . N for the stewed chicken , we went with the rice . the moist and tender chicken came with a gravy that was rich . with baby bok choy on the side , this definitely eats like a meal - for under N . pan fried beef potato cake N . N and if anything is a must order ( other than the soup dumplings ) , it ' s these pan fried potato cakes . a gluttonous form of chinese latkes , there was richly seasoned beef and potato bits within . and the crispy exterior offered great texture . shanghai pork soup dumplings N . N but what are we really here for ? the infamous xlb . for everyone other than myself , this was the first adventure into soup dumplings . so naturally , some instruction was needed so the night didn ' t end with peoples ' mouths being scalded . simply grab your dumpling with your chopsticks and place them on your soup spoon . then , pierce the skin to allow some of the hot broth to seep out . slurp and then take a big bite of the dumpling . sweet , savory , and then sweet again . all filled within a gossamer thin fresh dumpling wrapper . i could easily eat three orders of these in one sitting . crab pork soup dumplings N . N but on this occasion , we had to try the crab and pork iteration as well . the scent and taste of the crab comes on the forefront , with the pork taking over on the end . i prefer the regular pork soup dumplings , but this offers a nice change of pace for those inclined for surf and turf . so at dim sum garden , for under N , a party of N can get their fill of great food to start off the night . but really , i ' d pay twice as much for these iron chef-endorsed soup dumplings . they ' re just that good . and don ' t forget - add an order of those delicious pan fried beef potato cakes !

177064,2879,1/19/2011,"serving up fresh all-beef patties "" west-coast "" style , pyt at the piazza in northern liberties is the hamburger haven of philadelphia . located in trendy northern liberties , pyt features an outdoor patio with seating in the warmer months with everything from plush , brightly-colored couches to aluminum picnic tables . getting a table is a bit of a free-for-all , but reservations are accepted . like seating , service can be a little scarce at times - we waited about N minutes at a table for a server to bring us menus . pyt ' s menu consists of mostly burgers , but they do also offer vegetarian burgers ( which i didn ' t try , but i was told the veggie-patties were made fresh in their kitchen daily ) as well as salads and chicken sandwiches . their burger offerings included a range of combinations and flavors from "" the classic "" ( N ) served with bacon , cheddar and all the toppings to their "" burger of the week "" ( N- N ) featuring new and sometimes exotic creations every week . famous "" burgers of the week "" have included the "" krispy kreme "" burger - a double cheese burger served between two krispy kreme doughnuts and filled with N strips of chocolate covered bacon , the french onion gruyeur burger and a veal parmesan burger . as enticing as these options seemed , i settled for "" the fat boy monster "" ( N ) - two beef patties , each topped with sharp cheddar and crispy bacon , three onion rings , lettuce , tomatoes and "" special sauce . "" while pyt is known for its fresh burgers , their menu also features a rare treat - adult milkshakes . for those of you who are not familiar with this concoction , it is the heavenly combination of a traditional ice cream milk shake and flavored alcohol - the perfect compliment to a pyt burger . creative names give way to delicious mixtures like the juan valdez - chocolate ice cream with kahlua and patron cafe xo , and the caucasian - vanilla ice cream blended with vanilla vodka and kahlua . the peanutbutterchocolatebanana milkshake with chocolate ice cream , banana liquer , rum and peanut butter seemed like the perfect caloric accompaniment to my fat boy , so i indulged . all adult shakes are priced at N and come topped with whipped cream , sprinkles and a cherry . the price is reasonable for a fairly large serving , not quite enough for two to share , but more than enough for one . if you aren ' t interested in the combination of milkshakes and alcohol , pyt does offer them separately with non-alcoholic milkshakes ( N ) , a full bar and an impressive craft beer list to accompany your burger . our milkshakes came before the food , but we didn ' t really mind . the milkshakes were smooth and creamy with just enough alcohol to enjoy , but not overpowering . they tasted exactly as you would imagine a milkshake with alcohol to taste , delicious . it was only a short while until our hamburgers came out . the burgers were , by all standards , excellent . the patties were cooked exactly to our request and the toppings were generous , yet manageable . it was a over-sized burger better suited for a fork and knife rather than just my average-sized hands , but in the american backyard bbq tradition , i dug in with both hands ( i suggest using your dominant hand to control the tremendous patties and your non-dominant hand to corral your toppings ) . their "" hall of fame "" burgers come with fresh-cut , seasoned french fries and a deli pickle . the waiter informed us that the patties are purchased as fresh ground beef from a local butcher and hand formed in pyt ' s kitchen every day . a fresh and locally-focussed practice that makes all the difference in creating these beefed-up burgers . desserts are seasonal and were available but we decided that our milkshakes satisfied our sweet-tooth ' s craving . with dinner , drinks , tax and tip for below- N , pyt is a rare combination of quality food and affordable price that creates a real value with college students or professionals looking for some inexpensive jumbo burgers , a fun colorful environment and the location of the newly renovated piazza . pyt is suitable for a drink or a date , and for our dog-owners , ( leashed ) pooches are welcome ! the bottom line going to pyt is like going to a hipster backyard barbecue , with service that can sometimes match , but it is a great spot for some of the best burgers and "" adult milkshakes "" philly has to offer , if you have the time to wait . lunch and dinner hours can be very busy , particularly on warm summer nights when the patio is open , so be sure to clear some time from your schedule to sit down and enjoy ( responsibly ! ) ",4,-1,pyt

22741,3394,12/26/2013,"one of the many reasons why you should venture off to old city would be establishments like this . the entrance alone makes you feel like you have entered into a whole different state of mind . a relaxed state , a comfort state escaping the ongoing walking traffic outside , or the hustle of the cars trying to maneuver there way to that green light . i think it could also be that the feel of walking through the curtains sets the mood for some delightful cocktails , with a kick to it . a toast to the libation gods with a mouthwatering menu for an added measure is what can be expected . bridget was our bartender that evening , i must say she was awesome , always on the game never missing a beat . i will say even her coworker kept things lively , i want to say his name was mike , but i could be wrong . i did remember he was slinging some great sangria concoctions at the yelp pool party event . now seeing i am a beer aficionado , i pay homage to a great craft on tap , sassafras on the other hand has a small selection on tap . even with the small selections to peruse from , their bottled selections is very impressive , where i enjoyed an innis and gunn by the way . the pregame festivities prior to me enjoying this fine craft i was surveying their cocktail list . the one that caught my attention was their "" moscow mule "" that i recommend , well everything they make i recommend that is a given . i also decided to peruse a french drop cocktail with absinthe added to the mix . mike , well i am going to call him "" mike "" for the moment makes this concoction , with a story behind it . the presentation alone in making this concoction will have you mesmerized . a nice glass of liquid licorice basically with a kick you won ' t feel right away . what is more interesting is the glass of ice water given to you for back up , just in case you are not into licorice , it will somewhat defuse that taste . sassafras is an establishment that has a relaxing vibe to it with a few libations along with some great food . i did not partake in the food , but from what i have seen it does look delicious . i also will say this , you might want to go in there during the different seasons , they always have a new blended drinks , to sangria they are displaying .

126999,1087,4/9/2011,"eva h . wrote a one-star review below , and i simply have to jump to marigold ' s defense . i had many of the same dishes she did , and the best way to describe it is as a "" culinary oddyssey "" . my only conclusion is that eva either entered into the experience with the wrong expectations , and or has no taste in food . first of all , to address the price we did not buy into any special "" tasting menu "" , and were treated to N amuse bouche , on top of our appetizer , entree , and dessert , and the entire experience cost us N-N a head including tax and tip . for N courses , i consider that an extremely competitive price , even in philly . compare it , for example , to bibou , and you will see that they have nearly identical pricing structure . with regard to quality eva goes out of her way in attempting to describe excellent food in a negative way . the "" molten rotten cheese "" was a N-year-old aged cheddar , and it wasn ' t rotten . either she has no idea what cheese is supposed to taste like , or has a strong need to apply her narrative of "" terrible meal "" to even the most straightfoward experiences . i ' m reminded of the scene in "" can ' t hardly wait "" , where william ( who has never had beer ) exclaims , "" nobody drink the beer , the beer has gone bad ! "" on a similar note , the chilled chestnut ravioli was a big favorite at our table of N . let me set the record straight the food quality is extremely high . i know it ' s my word ( and the words of nearly every other reviewer ) against hers , but the technical and artistic skills on display are world-class , and i base that on my own experience dining at chez panisse and other top restaurants throughout the u . s . a . , europe , and asia . lastly , let ' s talk about pacing marigold is a place you go for a slow , intimate dinner . our meal lasted N hours , and for us this was a feature . we brought two bottles of our favorite wines and found the rate of N-N minutes per course gave us time to talk , drink , savor , anticipate , and celebrate . expert timing . all i can imagine is that eva h . was extremely upset ( and rightly so ) that she was being charged double for a "" tasting menu "" that offered far less than twice the value . given my N experiences dining at marigold , i cannot imagine it being a worthwhile investment , and i would have found it disappointing in the extreme . the reason for this , however , is only because i so greatly enjoyed their normal dining experience . let me recap that last point loud and clear for those skimming this review if you are concerned that you may not like the tasting menu , please stick to the regular menu ! it has N-N courses , and involves plenty of tasting ! in conclusion , please do not use eva h . ' s review as the basis for your decision on whether to eat at marigold . her tirade has all the signs of sour-grapes whining from a woman who accidentally bought a "" tasting menu "" no knowing what that meant . i am certain that she had a negative experience , and i am truly sorry she couldn ' t enjoy what they offer as much as i did . however , her single-minded need to cast even the best parts of her meal in a negative light does little to support her review ' s credibility .

227987,4022,12/30/2014,"by looking at the outside it can be a bit intimidating hole in the wall . fear not this place is really a gem . the two brothers ( chef waiter ) are excellent people ! very caring and treat you like family . my wife is filipino and she gave it two thumbs up for it ' s authenticity . prices were very reasonable even though the menu was a bit sparse . on my way to the bathroom i looked into the kitchen it ' s tiny ! this i presume is the main factor for the limited menu . why is N star missing ? the sister came in toward the end of our meal . as we were settling the check and taking some food to go she literally snatched one of the menu ' s from my possession and told me "" why are you taking my menu , your not supposed to have that ! "" . apparently it was a friday saturday menu , not the regular menu . she didn ' t even talk to her brother ( the chef ) who gave it to my wife as we were inquiring for our next visit and future larger purchases such as lechon . this tainted an overall great experience and changed the mood instantaneously . i kept my cool out of respect for the two brothers . it was also an anniversary dinner with my wife . please note it ' s cash only . we shall return and hope our follow up visits shares some of the other great reviews for the sister of the establishment . best regards , j",4,1,papa s kitchen

30291,237,3/11/2013,"before my last experience at silk city . i was raving to my friends about this place . i would have given it four stars . their thai chilly wings are the reason i kept going back they are soooo good . and their hippy friendly vibe made me feel comfortable . my last experience has changed my mind and is seems their popularity has weaken their concern for quality customer service . after enjoying a show case on the bar side . my two girlfriends and i went to the food side for a quick bite and a girls night . so three brown skin girls on a tuesday night it ' s not busy and its about eleven ' ish . when we sat down . water was served when my friend noticed something floating in her water . she asked the server if she could have another water . the server was hesitant ( maybe she didn ' t hear ? ) . but the way she reacted and her non-verbal ques where not warm and accepting . my friend even questioned if the server truely got her a new water . we brushed it off . without looking and the menu my friend and i ordered the wings and she orders fries for us to share . i had been to silk city about five times before and knew i wanted wings and fries . it was my friends first time and our other friend ordered a desert . when the food came i was surprised to see that their was cheese on top of the fries . i explained to our server susan that i forgot that it came with cheese as i am lactose intolerant . i also explained that i am normally asked by my server if i would like the cheese on top or to the side . susan went on to say that i could dig thru the fries and find the un- cheesed ones on the bottom . i ask if we could have the fries replaced . she said we would have to pay . really over some fries ! ! ! ! i would nerver think i would have to write a review over fries . ohhh it gets better . we ate our food i was famished and the wings thou a little cruncher than usual where finger licking good . i ate them all while the fires sat their untouched . all the while having a great time with my girls . i couldnt get the fries situation out of my head . i have been in the customer service feild for a while and this situation just rubbed me the wrong way . now i know their is a strong yet mostly true stereotype that brown skin people don ' t tip . i am brown skin and it is mostly true . but i try my best to combat that stereotype and i normally try to leave a least N or N which ever is higher . maybe susan saw brown girls and decided she didn ' t give a hoot about plastering a warm smile on her face . ( on principle , in the end , we still left an average tip which was more than shady susan deserved ) so asked her manager ( i wish i had gotten his name tall skinny male with glasses ) hoping that i would at least get the fries taken off . so i explained to him exactly as i did susan . we went to the kitchen to consult with susan . came back and told me that since i had been their before i should have known that the fries came with cheese . but this one time he would make an exception . along with a gesture that looked like it was very difficult for him to take the fries off . ummm yes we are still talking about fries not a steak or the most expensive item on their menu . fries . the principle of understanding customer error does not exist at silk city even when it comes to the cheapest thing on their menu . now i understand that it was my error in not memorizing or reading the menu . because i assume that when i order fries i just get fries and i am reminded of extras . but the way this situation was handled is exactly how some restaurants start loosing bussiness . silk city has gotten one star for customer service and the extra star was because i did acutally enjoy those wings . i hope the cook hasn ' t turn into a pretentious hippy snobb either .
