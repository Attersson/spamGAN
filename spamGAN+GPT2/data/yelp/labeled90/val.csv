9,9,52132,13945,4035,10/26/2014,"one of the best new restaurants i ' ve tried this year . i really enjoyed every dish we had which happens infrequently . this is a great neighborhood restaurant as well as one worth travelling for . i loved all the asian ingredients and components in each dish . i thought every dish was well balanced . . . you can taste the ingredients but none were overpowering . amuse-bouche - i like the fine dining touch without having to go to a fine dining establishment . the papaya salad and tomatoes was a lovely little bite with just enough fish sauce to taste but not turn pungent . oxtail spring rolls - two cigar-like rolls with crispy , golden skin . the meaty oxtail and cumin flavors came through and the bone marrow added richness . the green dipping sauce was fresh and almost palate cleansing . octopus - yes , the octopus was tender . but what i really loved was the pork xo and brown butter fingerling foam . the pork xo flavor was spot on and provided crispy little nuggets of texture . while most foams are airy and disappear , the texture of the fingerling foam coats the tongue so you can taste the buttery goodness . we scraped every bit off the plate . pig out for two - this dish is not as overwhelming as it may appear in pictures . the pork cubes are not as large in person but are still very satisfying . for N , it ' s worth it because it comes with a filling bowl of noodles for each person . as comparison , other entrees range N- N depending on the current menu . the berkshire pork was tender and juicy with crispy skin . the ginger scallion sauce sambal sauce were great condiments to put on each bite of pork . i usually have ginger scallion sauce with boiled chicken rice dishes i get in chinatown bbq places , so this was a new pairing for me to have it with pork . and it was just as delicious . the spicy peanut noodles has a nice level of heat and is not lacking in peanuttiness . and the fresh persimmon arugula salad was pretty and helped balance the rich flavors of the pork and noodles . the menu notes the pig out is limited quantity and i ' m not sure how often or when they sell out . but there were a lot of orders for this dish . ( we got there at N N on sat . for a walk-in party of N . ) corn side dish - the kaffir lime and curry were so delicious with the corn . it is a very good sized portion for a side at N considering the quality of food here . definitely recommend this . seriously a delicious meal .

"" , you wonder aloud . "" yes and yes !

( swanky ! ) it was perfect because there was just N of us , and since we were at the end of the counter , i could sit and face the other two people in my party without having to worry about getting my hair in someone ' s ceviche . we started with the tinto sangria - amazing ! the cinnamon really gives it a nice flavor . and we got N full glasses each , which was certainly better than a ' by the glass ' option . ( my friend ' s husband ordered a glass of red wine , which despite a fresh bottle just being uncorked , had bits of cork floating in his glass . but the bartender was quick to refresh it . ) then we all ordered N-N plates each and it became "" night of N bites ! "" first up the tuna starter with crackers . ( this ain ' t yo ' mama ' s tuna snack ! ) second patatas braves ( spicy potatoes ) croquetas de jamon ( ham croquettes ) - the potatoes were amazing the sauce on top was flavorful and a perfect compliment . the croquettes were so-so their sauce was a little lacking and not so complimentary . third cana de cabra the cheese was so sweet and delicious . the fig and cherry marmalade was sweet but not overpowering . i still can ' t believe we left almost half of the cheese wheel left because it was so good , but they did give us a lot . we split the first half generously between the N of us there was still some to spare . fourth pulpo ! ! ! my friend found it a bit salty for her taste but i thought it was fantastic , with little sliced potatoes mixed in . fifth bacon wrapped dates yeah , they ' re covered in bacon - i don ' t think i need to tell you more . anything bacon the best ever . next spanish tortilla - the buttery spread kind of overwhelms the flavor , so try it without first . then decide if you want to bog all that down ( you won ' t , trust me ) followed by duck confit flatbread - i would make this every day at home if i could . it was seriously one of the most amazing things i ' ve ever tasted . so many delicious flavors ! who knew flatbread could be so upscale ? even more braised pork shoulder - it was like a little mini sandwich ! very delicious and flavorful ! ( i ' m sure it made up for my friend ' s husband ' s side trip to pat ' s for a cheesesteak earlier that afternoon ) i saved everything that i personally ordered for last since my tastebuds had a higher stake in these items -baked goat cheese get this ! eat it all ! don ' t share with your friends ! seriously ! my friend ' s husband said he had "" od ' ed "" on goat cheese in his youth so he couldn ' t have any of it , which was fine by me ! the tomato basil sauce was so creamy and delicious and the cheese is sweet and warm and gooey - the combination of both of those things is pure perfection . -calamari squid is a love hate thing either you love it or you hate it . it ' s also a can get it perfect or really mess it up thing . this kind of wavered in between . it was served lightly tossed in garlic oil . i didn ' t squeeze the lemon on it at first , but after i did , it made a difference . could also probably have used a little salt and was just a tiny bit overcooked , but not bad . -asparagus multiple mouthgasms ! asparagus ! truffle ! poached egg ! cheesy crisp thing ! they saved the best for last ! i even went back and dipped the remaining calamari in the truffle egg yolk mixture - now that definitely improved it ! overall the food was phenomenal . the ambiance was great . ( the tapas lounge seemed a lot less stuffy than the front of house darker , wooden walls , more intimate ) you definitely get a lot of food for your money as opposed to some other tapas places in this town ( side eye to a certain nolibs staple ) and it ' s a garces restaurant , so really , that speaks for itself since you know what you ' re getting before you even walk through the front door . ( unlike some places in this town monopolized by a certain restaurateur who leaves you feeling empty in your stomach , your wallet , and your sense of self respect when you ' re treated like throwaways by the too-cool hipster waitstaff instead of actual customers . ) i can ' t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu and hopefully even the chef ' s tasting sometime because i ' d love to see what else the iron chef has up his sleeve !

( think starbucks with a nicer , less-commercialized twist . ) enjoy your favorite drink with some free refills ! in the far left corner of the restaurant is where the home-made pizzas are produced . on top of your traditional pizza-parlor pizza , they also make other specialties . the most notable among these is , by far , the focaccia . marzullo ' s makes their focaccia in large square pieces that can be bought as a whole or cut individually . focaccia is a doughy pizza without cheese . the restaurant uses fresh sun-dried tomatoes on the top with herb-flavored oils . it is truly a delicacy ! the left wall has the deli counter with the kitchen behind it . now , we are not talking about your typical deli , this one is quite massive ! they have three very large refrigerated cases which hold everything from your basic cheeses to prosciutto and capicola an italian food-lover ' s dream come true ! two of the cases mentioned hold the cold cuts , meats , and cheeses , while the third cabinet is a little different . unlike the other cases , the third cabinet has all of the pre-prepared foods that are great to get either for take-out or as a quick sit-down fix . the dishes in this cabinet change daily , but you will always be sure to find something that is to your liking ! some of the dishes i have seen include stuffed artichokes , eggplant parmigiana , penne alla vodka ( with homemade vodka sauce ) , baked ziti , lasagna , fresh mozzarella balls , and chicken cutlets , among so many others . and now this is my favorite part the dessert bar ! it is in close proximity to the entrance and bisects the entire restaurant , separating the two sides that i have mentioned . logistically , from left to right , there is a long freezer , a tall stand-up cake display case , and a long cookie and cake glass case . the freezer holds the gelato , which is magnificent ! they have in the ballpark of eight to ten flavors , all of which are excellent ( well , at least the five or so that i have tried ) the cake display typically holds about ten cakes and pies . i have tried such mouth-watering dishes as rum raspberry cake , key lime pie , and a traditional new york cheesecake ( my personal favorite ) . marzullo brothers also has numerous other cakes and pies on display all of which will please your taste buds ! the selection also changes frequently so the more times you visit the more variety will come your way . the last part of the dessert bar is a long case , which holds a few more cakes pies , a slew of cookies , as well as cannoli shells . when you ask for a cannoli , they will make it right in front of you , which makes these the freshest cannolis you can get around here ! the cookies abound at marzullo ' s ! you will always be delighted with at least a dozen different types of italian cookies in stock at any given time . there are also a couple of cakes and pies in this case that have overflowed from the stand-up display case . and remember how i said that there are two sides to the restaurant , well , now on to the right side . marzullo brothers restaurant and caf offers you a more intimate setting on this side . most of the tables are set up in two or fours , but they will , of course , happily move the tables to your liking . without the hustle and bustle of the deli , kitchen , and desserts , the "" dining room "" will allow you some additional privacy , if you so desire . the wait-staff - who serve both sides of the restaurant - are superb . i always seem to want many different , seemingly small requests that sometimes have waitresses in other restaurants rolling their eyes ( such as lemons , extra gravy , more bread , or whatever ) , and i always receive a pleasant smile , and a "" one second , please , "" here . the wait-staff is always on hand for anything you might need . now , here is where i usually find very helpful reviews that run down the entire menu of the restaurant , but i am not going to do that . basically , any food imaginable that is available at other italian restaurants will be available here . that ranges from hamburgers , pizzas , and sandwiches to filet mignon and sea bass ( plus the dishes that i sprinkled throughout the review ) . that is probably my favorite aspect of this restaurant its versatility ! there is truly something for everyone when you come here , no matter what mood you may be in .

812,812,52935,167529,4613,9/9/2014,"it ' s football season and what pairs better with football than barbecue ? so on saturday when my wife and i were preparing for the notre dame v michigan game we thought that take out from uncle willie ' s bbq in west haven would be a great fit . for those who know me or who have followed my reviews , you know that i am brutally honest . i review a restaurant based on my perception and experience cooking . now i am a trained chef and my passion is good food , so my rule of thumb has always been that a restaurants food needs to be better than , if not equal to what i can do at home . unfortunately during this game , uncle willie ( like michigan ) never made it into the end zone . i will start off by saying that this was not my first time at uncle willie ' s . a few weeks back my wife and i stopped in on a sunday afternoon to test the food . during that visit all we ordered was pound of burnt ends and a sweet tea . i was surprised at how long it took them to serve the burnt ends and to be honest i didn ' t pay much attention until we sat outside to eat . at first glance i noticed that the serving was not all brisket , to which burnt ends come from . there was a small about of pulled pork in there as well . it really didn ' t matter at the time , we wanted to taste the bbq . i will say the meat had a really nice smoke flavor that wasn ' t overpowering yet lingered on your taste buds leaving you wanting more . on saturday we called ahead and ordered two bbq dinners with N sides . my wife stuck with the burnt ends with mashed potatoes and mac n ' cheese . i ordered the brisket with collard greens and the black-eyed peas and rice . when my wife arrived to pick up our dinner it was ready , so i would say service was quick and without incident , as it should be with a takeout order . however , let ' s talk about the food itself side dishes N star out of N we had to throw two of them in the garbage . the mashed potatoes were overcooked and the potatoes had broken down and turned into mush , however the chef chose to mix them up and serve them anyway . they lacked any flavor or seasoning , the texture was really unappealing , certainly not the fluffy , creamy , buttery texture you expect from mashed potatoes . the mac n ' cheese . . . . . the macaroni was cooked properly but the cheese sauce didn ' t appear to be house made . i would compare it to one of the canned or jarred sauces you can heat up in the microwave one that becomes overly creamy when warm , but solidifies like jello when it cools down . i ate my side dishes , however the collard greens were undercooked and therefore lacked the deep flavors that develop when braising greens . i also found myself searching for the acidity that often accompanies a good southern style collard green , but loved the level of heat that they offered . i enjoyed the black-eyed peas and rice offered as they had a nice flavor and the rice leant texture to the dish , my only concern would be the peas . they were slightly mushy as if they sat in the steam table too long and had begun to overcook or come from a can . overall a horrible display of quality control and lack of standards , yet if uncle willy takes my review to heart , this is an easy fix . meat N stars out of N i loved the meat . uncle willie knows how to smoke meats , i will give him that . the only reason i didn ' t give them N stars was because of the test experience . i almost feel insulted that the chef that day didn ' t think anyone would notice the difference between burnt ends and pulled pork and that shows inconsistency . again , this could be another quick fix . on saturday . both dishes had an incredible depth of flavor that you can only find in real bbq . the brisket was tender and fell apart in your mouth , i even had a couple pieces where the fat was not completely rendered down or trimmed away and for me it offered yet another layer of flavor . just delicious . my mouth is watering just thinking about it . pricing N stars out of N i know uncle willie is living the american dream and in this for the money , but brother slow down . you ' re a bbq shack and i meant that will all due respect . you ' re not a michelin rated restaurant offering table service dinner and you don ' t have expensive china plates . so why charge your customers more than N for two takeout boxes ? ? the simple answer here is , you ' re overpriced . the restaurant business in not a get rich quick opportunity . it ' s about sharing your passion for food with the people and being able to live off of it . if done successfully , you will find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . however N for two styrofoam containers with N N pound of meat in them , you won ' t be seeing this irish fan on gameday every week . maybe to celebrate if we can make the playoffs . overall - N stars out of N",2,1,uncle willie s bbq

"" it came out rather quickly and was a huge portion . thank goodness because i was starved ! i ordered my eggs poached and they were perfect . the salad was perfectly seasoned and the labane was creamy and savory . the burekas were good but not amazing . they were quite dense and not as light and crispy as i ' m used to having them . the service was good and , from what i could tell , the others in my party were happy with their selections . overall , a good spot in park slope for brunch . i guess i ' ll have to try dinner there sometime .

"" and then she lost me completely . despite the rushed introduction she was still extremely likable , and very patient , so balthazar gets N star for great service right off the bat . we decided to order the french onion soup , the balthazar burger to split and a virgin bloody mary drink . as an main course i order the duck confit with mushrooms , crispy potatoes , and fresee salad . my boyfriend ordered the steak with a side of fries . its a shame that this is a reputable french restaurant , and it can ' t even get a simple french onion soup right . this was probably the worst french onion soup i have ever had . generally , i am not a negative person , and i usually find something positive to say about everything . i felt like the soup was way too tomatoey for a onion soup . the onions were undercooked , and the cheese was non existent . it was very watery , and one dimensional . it definitely could of used an hour more on the stove to helped deepen the flavors . my boyfriend on the other hand , loved the soup - - . men . . . the bloody mary was also horrible . admittedly i do not like tomato juice , but this was way too tomatoey . i felt like i was drinking a salty tomato puree . ugh . nauseating . we asked we could have another drink in exchange , which our waitress did more than happily . instead we got a blackberry mint mojito which was outstandingly refreshing and delicious . the balthazar burger that my boyfriend and i split was extraordinarily average . way too under seasoned , the edges were too burned and there was nothing in the burger that popped . i was so disappointed ! it was so bland , and the bread wasn ' t even toasted . it ' s the little things in a burger that make all the difference . my duck confit was delicious and cooked to perfection , it was complimented so well by the mushrooms . the "" micro "" frisee salad was indeed micro and not enough to balance the dish . but i loved the dish none the less . boyfriend ' s steak was cooked perfectly but bland and under seasoned . the apple tart we ordered for desert was delicious and the high light of our evening . overall , my experience here was a bit disappointing only because i had such high expectations of this place . nonetheless , it was a nice atmosphere , great service , delicious food and not too expensive .

N . our waiter , who was great , did warn us that it was a small portion and recommended the salmon instead . i try not to order salmon most places because it ' s usually unimpressive , but i would consider it next time since i trusted his judgment . sangria is extremely strong , one glass was more than enough for a weekday dinner . if there ' s one thing you can skip here , it would be the dessert . we got the grand marnier custard and the apple confit . they were just okay - i liked the apple a little more , the warm apple slices were nice with the ice cream . the custard was a goopy mess . i would have preferred to try two more plates instead of the dessert . besides the desserts , all the plates were excellent - nothing was bad . what separated the best dishes for me is likely a matter of personal preference in food . i ' ll have trouble next time deciding between getting the dishes i loved last time , and trying new dishes . maybe the charm will wear off eventually , but for now i am smitten and i cannot wait to go back .

( N N ) as far as the restaurant is concerned , i love the decor and the ambiance . it has a sophisticated look , but a "" low budget "" price point . . . . a wonderful combination . what i don ' t like , is the actual setup . you need to walk past tables and a bar to check in , or pick up delivery . that setup lends itself to causing a lot of traffic to build up inside . you know , people trying to get a table , running into others picking up , running into people at the bar , running into people trying to go to the bathroom . ugh ! i think it makes sense to have the counter in the front of the restaurant , near the door ( almost all of the restaurants i frequent do that ! ) . forget service . there was one lady at the desk , who was cashing people out , answering the phone , and dealing with customer pick ups . she handed me the bag of food , but did not even ask me for my cash , or count it . i literally left the money next to the phone where she was taking an order , and left without her even acknowledging that i had paid . ughhh . bottom line i wouldn ' t oppose going there again , but i certainly would not go out of my way to visit . you pay for what you get , basically .

N hours for a table . after an hour and a half , a group of trash from across the bridge walked in and started literally harassing another friendly group of people who were waiting for a table at the bar , saying that they were blocking them from getting drinks . mind you , the place was so crowded you could hardly move at all . it got very heated and the trash were cursing , slurring sloppy drunken words , acting inappropriately , and making everyone very uncomfortable . it honestly looked like a real housewives convention , something you ' d think they ' d scripted for tv . freshly-manicured N "" pink nails pointed directly in people ' s faces , post-plastic-catfish-esque grins , overly exaggerated points of view , with nasally voices diligently expressing their discontent . they were making a huge scene amongst an especially crowded family restaurant . tim turned to me at one point and said , "" wow , i thought you only see this shit on tv "" . when the manager came over to mediate , instead of ' taking the trash out ' like he should have , he sat them immediately - and ahead of the rest of us - including the group they were harassing , who had also been waiting over two hours at this point . the trash , probably N minutes , if that . when i finally confronted the manager , he explained that there were two tables of ten who had already paid and were lingering . i suggested as a a courtesy to the rest of their loyal patrons , that he kindly let the people know that if they were done paying , others had been waiting over two hours for a table and i was certain they would respect and understand that . but the manager did no such thing . he said he , "" couldn ' t do that "" . now N . N hours with no audible buzzer , we are starving and drunk . we make them seat us in the self serve section , rigging two tables in that weird penis scrotum- shape when you attempt to join one rectangular and one round table together .

3378,3378,55501,11239,1814,1/21/2013,"yes , i agree that the food here is good , but everybody needs to calm down - this burger seriously isn ' t the greatest thing ever as some people claim it to be . also , those shoestring fries are absolutely worthless . i almost felt like this was N-star worthy , but that was mostly because of the slight let down feeling i had after reading endlessly about this burger on every list of best burgers ever and seeing all of the rave reviews about the restaurant everywhere you look . but the food here is actually really good . except for those silly shoestring fries ( sorry , i just really don ' t get those ) . with the reputation preceding this place , i thought i was slick going on a monday to avoid the crowds and the long waits , but no such luck . well , we actually got there at a little before N pm , and had to wait about N minutes for a table , which i guess could have been a lot worse if we went during the weekend . actually , toward the end of our wait , we already heard the host quoting N minutes to an hour wait times even for parties of two . insane . it ' s a very hip atmosphere . the stools in place of proper chairs for all the seating is always a dead giveaway for that . my wife likes a back to her seat when she eats , so she was pleased when we were led to our table on the second floor in a cozy little area of the restaurant where there are some benches for same-side table seating against the walls . the entire place also has a nice fun motif of pig decorations everywhere , from nice pig paintings to little pig signs on the bathrooms . the place happens to pull off a kitschy vibe while also being classy hipster at the same time . so if you come here and don ' t order the burger , you are a failure . to start , it also seems like the other thing people can ' t stop whining about is the deviled egg ( N ) . this was ok i guess . mad oily , and nothing mind-blowing ( yelp . com biz photos the- ) . we also got the chicken liver toast ( N ) . this was also extremely rich and heavy , but was delicious . now , the burger . it ' s a really thick , sizable patty which is great . the roll is nice and thick and tasty , which is great , and very important so it can soak up all that juice from the meat and not get soggy . the roquefort cheese didn ' t really do it for me . it was a little too funky . that little bit aside though , i do concur that this is a very excellent burger . but its not as transcendent as all of these other chefs and food bloggers would lead you to believe . the shoestrings fries are a real waste of time and stomach space . aside from the huge pile of them looking kind of cool and making for a pretty picture next to the huge burger ( yelp . com biz photos the- ) , they really have no culinary or enjoyment value at all . they ' re really hard to eat and are not particularly tasty . to even taste them , you ' ve gotta get a good fistful of them in your mouth at once since they ' re so thin on their own , which is a real mess and pretty embarrassing as you can feel the other hipsters watching you make a pig out of yourself . another reason i came on monday instead of the weekend was to try the cubano sandwich ( N ) since i love cuban sandwiches and this one looked really good and they don ' t have it on the weekend brunch menu . it did not disappoint . in fact , this might have been even more enjoyable than the burger for me , though it came with an equally forgettable side that was also a waste of time , some greens dressed in oil . lastly , we ended with the banoffee pie ( N ) ( yelp . com biz photos the- ) . this was truly incredible . composed of layers of dulce de leche , pastry cream , sliced bananas and whipped cream , this really shows that they know what they ' re doing here . one of the tastiest desserts i ' ve had . this probably sounds like a lot of complaining for a N-star review . but it ' s just that i expected more after all the hype . all of the food really is excellent . you definitely need to come here at least once to try that burger ( don ' t waste yourself on the fries though ) .

3433,3433,55556,120023,1701,6/23/2012,"i write this review with a good deal of thought and sadness . my husband and i have a combined total of nearly N years in the restaurant business in nyc . we have done nearly every job , except as chef , there is to do in a restaurant . so i come from a place of knowledge and i realize that bad reviews are not taken lightly . the sadness i personally have is that we both wanted this restaurant to work , and to be a place that we would go to regularly as it is close to our home . we were there during their first week and liked the food , so returned . in fact , we went back repeatedly for the first three months . the food was good , but we recognized the bumps in the service as "" growing pains "" so were forgiving . for instance , they advertised breakfast , but wasn ' t open for breakfast . that ' s just bizarre , but we figured we would wait it out and see if they got their act together . we know the first few months of a new restaurant are the hardest . they soon offered "" delivery "" yet when we called for delivery , we were told they actually didn ' t have it because "" they don ' t have a bike . "" umm . . ok . the common sense thing would be a ) . don ' t offer delivery if you don ' t have it or b . ) get a bike . we were perplexed as to why someone would do such a weird thing . nevertheless , we were willing to be patient and ordered take out instead . we were convinced queens comfort had potential so let it go . things changed when i went in one day for a late lunch . i ordered a beef brisket sandwich , which is typically super-tender . the brisket sandwich came and was so tough i couldn ' t eat it . i called the waiter over and told him i knew the brisket had been microwaved- it was the only way a brisket could have been that tough and that incredibly hot in the middle . it was shoe leather . he apologized , and since he talked up the burger when i sat down , i ordered it . when it came , it was frozen in the middle . i couldn ' t believe it . i then realized it was N pm , and the reason why my food was terrible is because someone who wasn ' t trained kitchen staff was plating up my food and failing . this was the time when chefs take off and run errands as it is the slowest time of day . was a dishwasher turning out the food ? the waiter was really apologetic , and i told him i didn ' t blame him , that this was clearly a mistake by the people who run the place . he offered me another choice , which by now was ridiculous , but i cautiously ordered a fried green tomato sandwich to go . i brought it home and tried to eat it , but it was so soggy that it fell to pieces into a fried mush . i ended up throwing it out . it was such a bad experience we didn ' t go into queens comfort for a long time . a few months ago my husband went in on a sunday and reported he had a decent experience . in the interest of being fair and wanting to give it another shot , we went in a couple weeks later . it was about N N on a friday night and the counter had no one sitting there . the tables were pretty full , but the staff certainly shouldn ' t have been in the weeds as everything appeared manageable and there was only one deuce waiting . we were very hungry and were willing to sit at the counter . one table needed clearing and setting and another was paying their check . no one was at the door to greet us , so my husband went up to the expediter and asked if we could sit at the counter . the guy turned around and in a very rude , abrupt tone said , "" there ' s a line , you know . "" there was no "" hi , how may i help you ? "" which would have been what a restaurant who cared about their customers would have said . it was just one more thing in a long line of inept service points that we still found truly perplexing . that young man ' s rudeness made us turn right around and head straight for sugarfreak , who always treats us with respect and where we know we will get good food and good service . being that we have spent so many years in the business , we learned from friends that queens comfort is just a play thing for some kid who has never worked a day in the business . no wonder the service is so wretched ! he has never worked in a successful restaurant with good service and thinks his establishment can survive on the quality of food alone . good luck . at some point , people are going to stop coming because the service is so obnoxious or non-existant . it is just basic things that good restaurants know and implement that make the service good and this place knows little of it . and what is worse is that they don ' t seem to care . eating there is an exercise in masochism and i have to wonder if their customers like the abuse . i will never step foot in queens comfort again . there are just way too many other great restaurants in queens that are just as good or better ( like il bambino ) where i can spend my money and not feel i ' ve been slighted by a spoiled rich kid who thinks he knows it all . if i didn ' t have to give them one star i certainly wouldn ' t . and this is sad because we really wanted the place to be a regular stop for us .

N - i also love j-curry ) - of course , the curry did overpower the soba a bit , but i can definitely understand the popularity of this dish for those not too familiar with buckwheat soba . the broth dip is served in a slow boil , heated with a flame . the idea is that you take grab some soba noodles , dip in the boiling broth and then quickly slurp it from the serving bowl . if you ' re unfamiliar , ask a staffer to instruct you - they are cool like that . as you ' re finishing up , they give you some sobayu ( the water they cooked the soba in ) - for you to dilute with your broth and drink it like a soup . very nice touch . the homemade tofu as appetizer was very fresh and the coconut milk with mixed fruit dessert was excellent as well . my lady and i split an appetizer , had an entree each and split dessert - we left pretty full and the bill was just a tad under N total . not bad value . the only negative of the night was that they accidentally served our dessert to another table . but they apologized for the mixup and it didn ' t take too long for our replacement to come up . overall , excellent soba joint with a nice cartoon branding which should remain popular . i really hope cocoron starts expanding and opens up locations in toronto and vancouver - they would kill it out here .

4649,4649,56772,79450,973,1/24/2012,"yay . finally a filipino restaurant that we filipinos can be proud of . there are few , if any filipino restaurants that can draw non-filipinos in without alienating native filipinos but maharlika successfully bridges this gap . i have only been to this restaurant for brunch , so i can only speak to this experience . i will have to try it for dinner and update this review accordingly . however , based on this experience that i am about to review in more detail , i can make one generalization maharlika serves up food that is true to the heart of filipino cuisine but puts an innovative and modern twist to many items . i visited this restaurant this past weekend for brunch with some girlfriends . we ordered their version of chicken and waffles - fried chicken and ube waffles served with a carmelized macapuno syrup . this was exciting and delicious ! the chicken was hot and crispy and the ube waffle with the carmelized macapuno gave it that hint of sweetness to balance the salty chicken . we also tried the sisig platter with egg and garlic-fried rice - i really enjoyed this dish . i had never had sisig with egg and i thought it was perfection . i tried one of my friends ' dishes - the eggs imelda which was so innovative - it was a spin on egg benedict - and the laing and prawns were delicious . unfortunately , there was a dish that didn ' t quite do it for me - the tapsilog . silogs are usually a safe bet in any filipino restaurant - silogs consist of some type of meat , eggs and garlic fried rice . in this case , a tapsilog ' s meat is beef tapa . i didn ' t really care for the way this tapa was marinated and have definitely had better elsewhere . it wasn ' t bad , by any means it just wasn ' t great . oh and then there were the drinks ! they have some great looking concoctions but the only one i tried was pacquaio ' s punch which is a rum-based drink with a ginger syrup , lemon and a kiss of absinthe , garnished with a slice of ginger . twas good ! bottom line you should definitely check it out for brunch . great little spot , good food and drinks . just get there early or be prepared to wait !

5653,5653,57776,19740,1123,10/29/2013,"i came to supper for supper with a dear friend . it was a tuesday evening , and there was no wait whatsoever . however , the restaurant and the bar was pleasantly packed with customers . we were fortunate enough to have immediately available seats right at the bar in front of the kitchen . there are two sides to the restaurant , the bar and the dining . it ' s not a big place , per say , but it ' s comfortably cozy and intimate . it ' s a good place for groups too considering they have larger tables that seat at least six people or more . dim lighting , antique fixtures , chandeliers , wooden tables , give this place a lot of charm and visual character . in general , it ' s a very cute restaurant , and it ' s hardly your typical , generic italian restaurant . supper is a good choice in the les for classic italian food and good wine . i have mixed feelings about the food here , but i can still see the potential of a return . note , this place is cash only , and you ' re going to need at least N if you plan on drinking . the pricing of their main dishes is mid-range ( N ) . i am speaking only in terms of their dinner though . the menu is not very extensive , which actually makes it easier to decide . they have daily specials , a small variety of pasta dishes , and some meat entrees . they serve complimentary bread with a dipping of olive oil and white beans . we decided to start off with two appetizers , the bruschetta with salsa cruda ( vine ripe tomatoes ) and zucchine tagliatelle which comes in olive oil , garlic and toasted almonds . i wasn ' t terribly fond of these two actually . while the bruschetta looked amazing with the bright red topping of tomatoes , it was clearly just bread with tomatoes with little else to add intrigue . the grilled country bread was completely soaked in tomato juice , and hardly crisp or crusty as one should expect . after sitting for several minutes , it got on the very mushy side . you should indulge on this dish sooner rather than later . the zucchine was a good vegetable side dish , but it really did not hold much flavor . on the other hand , i ' d say their pasta dishes were very good . i had "" the timely priest stranglers "" with dad ' s sunday marinara sauce and fresh soft ricotta di pecora . it ' s basically a penne dish , but this might be one of the best penne dishes i have had . it ' s not your typical penne style pasta . the pasta was al dente , there was a ton of flavorful marinara sauce , and lots of fresh and delicious ricotta to top it all . it had a slight hint of spice too . my friend ' s choice of the spaghetti pomodoro e basilico was also great . it ' s a traditional spaghetti pasta dish that comes with a lot of sauce as well . the spaghetti was cooked nice and al dente . the portion sizes were just right . this isn ' t a family-style italian restaurant , so if you are thinking of sharing an entree , you may want to reconsider . to end it all , we decided on the affogato al cafe which is two scoops of vanilla ice cream topped off with a shot of espresso and foamed milk . this dessert was average in terms of the presentation and taste . the espresso just ended up melting the ice cream really fast as they pour it into the bowl . this dessert is meant to be eaten right away , or else it just becomes a bowl of coffee mixed with milk . i wasn ' t a huge fan of this as i prefer to take my time with dessert . i don ' t think it helped either that the restaurant itself was very warm temperature-wise . overall , supper has positive points regarding their ambiance and atmosphere , the friendly service , and their pasta dishes . yet , i felt the starter dishes plus dessert we had lacked something . none were stand out dishes , except for possibly the stranglers penne pasta . everything looks and sounds amazing , but if you really start to evaluate , it veers on average . if one isn ' t too critical , i don ' t see supper being a bad experience . i really liked the restaurant space itself and its charming environment . the service was completely fine . the pasta was very enjoyable . whilst some of the dishes were lacking , i don ' t see a strong reason for why i shouldn ' t return .

N-N .

N dollars for ordinary mac and cheese and they will put thick cut bacon fat on it if you like . thick fat bacon not crispy bacon . the wings are N bucks and are breaded , cant tell if they are frozen or not but they always come out soggy . tried them several times until i stopped ordering those as well . shakes are delicious and appropriately priced . fries are okay nothing to write home about and as mentioned early should be slightly larger in portion . they need to get their act together as they will not deliver N minutes away driving , N minutes away on bicycle and N minutes away walking literally N . N miles . as a reader you might be asking why don ' t you pick up . because i shouldn ' t have to . they delivered in the past and now gave me a lame excuse as to why they won ' t any longer . it depends on the driver . so the service at the restaurant depends on the server , the delivery depends on the driver which essentially means there is zero accountability and very little consistency . i wish this business all the luck in the world but if they can ' t figure out a way to cater to their repeat clientele without said clientele having to name drop that they know the owner every time they order delivery they will find themselves consistently replacing staff and soon not renewing their lease . i will not be coming back unless its for a shake or a hot dog .
