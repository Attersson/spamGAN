when my boyfriend and i checked into our room at the omni chicago , we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled , as if kids had been jumping on it . that was just the first of our ' issues ' . the glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them , and i saw a ( dead-thank goodness ! ) roach behind the toilet . we were given the hotel night stay by a friend , so we decided to just deal with it . we ordered some munchies from the kitchen , and the chips were stale , and the dip smelled sour . after coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies , we were able to enjoy our stay--but i would not recommend this place to anyone ! 
the entrance and room was spacious and modern , yet elegant . it was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of chicago . the drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds . indeed , it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots . 
the sofitel chicago water tower , while seemingly a good idea in theory , has many drawbacks . at first glance , it appears quite luxurious and grand , but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked . the hotel is quite tall , coming in at N stories , and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying . the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest , so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed . the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor , but its efforts fall short . the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars . the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city , but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment . the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general . the city ' s traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one ' s stay here . overall , i would not recommend this hotel . make a different choice . 
this has been one of the most pleasurable hotels ive ever stayed at . from the beautiful concourse to the amazing food , amalfi really exceeds its standards . the in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible . i highly recommend this hotel as i will give my stay a N N stars . 
i recently stayed at the talbott hotel for N nights and i could not have been more disappointed . it was a terrible experience . long wait to check into room since room wasn ' t ready even though i arrived way after the check in time . front desk was very rude . was given a smoking room when i had requested non-smoking . room service left a lot to be desired . the food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing . the staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly . had no toilet paper in room . room was very noisy . could hear people next door opening doors , watching tv , talking . the room was very dingy , small and had a musty odor . needless to say i will not be staying here again nor will i be recommending this hotel to anyone else . stay away from this hotel . not worth the money . 
my wife and i booked a room at the hilton chicago three weekends ago , as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel . we were expecting some minutia of luxury . however , this was not the case with the hilton chicago . first , we had reserved a room with a king size bed , but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed . now , we did get a reduced price because of this , but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked . second , we had to change our room key twice . the room keys they used supposedly lost their ' charge ' . this is what the front desk told us . so , we had to go up to our room , find out the key didn ' t work , then come back down stairs get a new key , then get back in . this was highly unprofessional , and they really need to look into their key system . lastly , we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room . we knew this was accurate , but i always check just in case . but two weeks later when i checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card . i had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card . suffice it to say we will not be staying there again . 
stay away from this hotel . a few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend . looking at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the sheraton chicago hotel and towers . they claim ' experience the extraordinary ' and this sounded great . when we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags . the front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks . after waiting N hours for our room we finally can start to relax . well upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming . the front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner . we packed our bags and headed over to ' x ' hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home . 
very disappointed in our stay in chicago monoco . we have stayed many times elsewhere , primarily in washington dc and are accustomed to great customer service , beverages like water or soda at the wine bar , coffee and papers in the morning , help with bags . not only did the chicago monoco do none of these things , the staff was not helpful , either . requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there . you got the feeling you were ' bothering ' people if you asked a question . no bellman , the doorman did not open the door or help with bags . even though we were traveling with a child , i had to request a fish when they did not bring it . really baffling . . as we love the monoco in washington . 
this a great property , excellent location and wonderful staff . everyone was very accommodating and polite . the room i had was on the Nrd floor and was like a suite , with a living area and a bedroom . the living room was spacious , with a plasma tv , a desk and a couch . the beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality . in the closed they placed an umbrella , which came in handy , it rained the whole time i was in chicago . the internet connection is N . N Nhrs . great place , i will return for sure . 
this hotel had a great location , but you can do much better for the money . the hallways smelled of smoke , dirty elevators , furniture in the lobby was thread bare . the staff was very helpful . the room was large , bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered . if you have any allergies don ' t stay here ! 
this hotel was not at all what i expected it would be . the website and it ' s pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in . the amenities were not what i was looking for , and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there . my aaa membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels . the staff was not very friendly or helpful when i had questions about the area , and they were not very prompt when responding to requests . i understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while i was there , but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service . i don ' t think i will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon . 
the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is a magnificent grand hotel . the size of the rooms , and the views of the city are phenomenal . at night the city lights up , and the sight is majestic . the hotel itself , and the employee ' s are wonderful , and well worth the pay to stay in such a place . this hotel has so much to offer , great dining , a fantastic gym set up for those of us , who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing . my wife and i have just left recently , and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out . big thumbs up to those who run that place , and helped us enjoy our stay . 
chicago is my favorite city visit . i wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the swissotel . it is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of chicago . i wanted to share my new love . it was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the chicago art institute it was a long walk , full of detours , and it was not easy to grab a cab . while the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean . the room service was slow , the food arrived cold , and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got . i do not think i have ever experienced the level of noise in such a ' grand hotel ' as the swissotel seems . i would not recommend the swissotel because disappointment , noise , and cold food should just not cost that much . 
we stayed at this hotel for N nights in august . we waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open , this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two ' s . our room had a great view of navy pier and was a good size . the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean . the location of the hotel is the best , we walked to navy pier and michigan ave . the breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two . would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again . 
stayed here for two days while attending lollopalooza music festival . one of the best locations in chicago , on michigan ave near the tribune and sun-times buildings . an easy walk or bus ride to many attractions . the king sized room was very nice , not large , but with a generous bathroom . service was excellent throughout . check out the awesome swimming pool , straight out of twenties . 
the service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient . the room was more then i has expected . it was spacious and laid out very well . i particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower . the bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable . i believe it ' s the first time i stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room . the location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go . i particularly enjoyed the excellent food at thechina grill which is attached to the hard rock hotel . the service was very good and the staff very friendly . 
my friend and i visited amalfi hotel last week when we were in chicago and found it to be a great place , very sophisticated and luxurious , with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service . the beds were comfortable . the room service was great as was the gym . . . i fully enjoyed the views from the hotel room . . . so beautiful at night . . . the city scape . and in the morning , the free continental breakfast was delicious . it was a wonderful experience being at the amalfi hotel in chicago . i am eager to visit there again . 
the ambassador east was a average hotel at best , and mediocre at worst . the bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff . the doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you . the room was lackluster , however . the bathroom was in especially bad shape . it was dirty when we arrived , with hair in the sink and shower . the shower was in really bad shape . the shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low . the water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit . the decor throughout the hotel ( lobby , hallways and rooms ) was very out-of-date and old-fashioned . i would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well . the business center with free internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use . the hotel ' s location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations . i would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions , but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms , i might be inclined to stay there again . . . . read more 
i would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are . for my wife and i , we enjoy the warmer colors . cleanliness along with excellent staff , made me feel away from home yet relaxed . being right downtown was perfect for location . the suites are very quiet as well . i surprised my wife with the ' shopping package ' . what a hit ! thanks homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown ! ! 
the palmer house hlton hotel has to be the nicest hotel i have stayed at in chicago . i went to chicago on a business trip for a meeting . when i arrived once i walked in , the lobby was beautiful , i couldn ' t hardly wait to see my room . the rooms were just as nice , the bathroom was immaculate ! we had a meeting in the clark meeting room , even that was nice ! i wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself ! i was there for about N days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like , grant park , lake michigan , mag mile which is a shopping heaven , and the navy pier , it never really like the normal stressed out meetings . i love chicago and i now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while i ' m in town . 
the hotel is in a good location . it is very contemporary in decoration . beautiful flowers in lobby . the room service was very good . concierge services were also very good . we were treated well . the shower water pressure was very poor . also , at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us , which we were charged for the Nrd night when our room was actually prepaid . it was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel . bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizers food . read more 
just putting in a good word for the hard rock hotel in chicago . the reviews i read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect . the location was perfect . the hotel was beautiful . our view was awesome . the room was large enough and very clean . the bed was very comfy . the staff were helpful - especially the concierge , jared . i couldn ' t find anything negative to say . if you want to stay in downtown chicago - you can ' t go wrong with this cool hotel . 
great expectations from the hotel of the fugitive ! wonderful lobby ! and that ' s it ! the room was old in style and furnitures , the tv was from the other century , no minibar , no wireless internet , no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room , those guys ignore that we are in the era of ipad without cable connections . small room , small bathroom , rude service room . they have lost my credit card number and want cash on delivery for a breakfast of N dollars . robbery in the business center , N , N cents a minute for internet connection , you have to pay to use word , or excel . never again ! 
my stay at the palmer house hilton was less than satisfactory . i would have expected much for from such a ' high end ' hotel . the rooms were way over priced , and the service was less than satisfactory . at one point , i left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up , and when room service came through , they were still there ! on the other side of things , the cup i had left on my desk ( which i was planning to use later ) was gone . my coffee and my towels were also never replaced . i also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room . rather , it was a ' nominal fee ' . after paying so much for a room , i had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi . my stay at the palmer house hilton left much to be wished for . i will not be staying there again . 
simply a nice place to stay . . . i had a great deal for the room , and was impressed with the quality . hotel staff was very helpful they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes . negative it is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it ' s the same here you have to pay for the internet . negative loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone , or them shower . 
we stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city . although the hotel looks nice , the service is terrible . the staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all . the room service closes at Npm so don ' t plan on getting hungry after that time . also , even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries . i will never go back to that place 
this hotel is amazing , i would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance . i stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations i expected plus more . i was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle . the restaurants at the fairmont were amazing as well . when staying at this hotel , food and wine at their best are portrayed . if i had to make the choice to stay here again , the only thing that i would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long ( it was so relaxing ! ! ) . already booked another stay for next year i enjoyed it so much . 
seriously overpriced the room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel . the ' amenities ' were a smoke screen , nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a holiday inn . i would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that i did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase . being charged N day for internet on top of a N night rate was a bit over the top . the bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient . the shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head , unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost . the staff were friendly and helpful , actually the best part of the stay were the staff . all in all i found it overpriced for the quality of the room . 
i got married in the chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the ambassador east hotel . they had nothing but nice things to say about it ! my husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs . the rooms are decorated so nicely and they don ' t have that funny hotel smell . the pump room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports . if i ' m ever in the area again i will be sure to book a room at the ambassador east hotel ! 
i decided to book at the amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on ta . i was blown away by the reviews for the amalfi on ta and decided to check it out . i was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and i was not disappointed . i asked to be put in a quiet room because i was having an interview the next day . the room was very quiet and in a great location , but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and i could hear people running on the treadmill during the day . however , it quieted down at night and i could not hear anything . the rooms were enormous for chicago and i was pleased ! ! ! the hotel provided free breakfast which was good , free internet , and free gym access . the hotel is only a few blocks from the magnificient mile and i walked there everyday to do shopping . i have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly . i wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was . all in all , i plan to stay at the amalfi anytime i visit chicago in the future . 
this hotel is ok but is not the best for the money . first of all the parking prices are exorbitant . i know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high . also , the service at this hotel was poor . i felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general , and the staff at the palmer house seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us . in addition i feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet . also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you . i would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about the palmer house . 
last month , my husband and i stayed at the intercontinental chicago while we were in town for imts . although they were very busy , the service was excellent and very professional . the staff were always smiling and happy to help . intercontinental was conveniently located near michigan avenue , and the best stores and restaurants in town . the view from our room was great ! our room was always clean when we arrived home at night , it was decorated nicely , and the beds were extremely comfortable ! we ate at the hotel ' s restaurant zest , and the food was great ! it was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while . we will definitely be back ! 
we stayed at the palmer house hilton in early december , we stay there that weekend every december and we think it is the best location in the city for us . we like state street better than michigan avenue and the palmer house is right there . we stayed in the towers , in a room with two double beds and N baths . the room was not huge , but very comfortable . the towers area was recently refurbished and it shows , the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen tvs on the walls , comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food drinks . there is a continental breakfast in the morning , appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes . there is a fridge stocked with soft drinks , water and juice that are yours for the taking . we were very pleased with the upgraded towers , everyone should check it out ! 
i recently had a horrible stay at the intercontinental hotel in chicago . when i first arrived i was impressed with the architecture and location , but things went downhill in a hurry . the front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though i had reserved a room with two queen beds , they told me that ' only king bed rooms were available at the time ' , and there was nothing they could do about it . the room itself was a nightmare . it smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement . there was also a huge problem with my television , in that it would automatically turn itself off every N minutes or so . i complained about these problems , but very little was done . the hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets , but the quality was only marginally improved . overall i was very disappointed with my stay at the intercontinental hotel in chicago . from the pictures i had seen online i had expected a wonderful hotel , but what i actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel . 
we recently celebrated our Nth anniversary in chicago and stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers . having looked at a gizillion places i chose this one because of its location to navy pier . ( we were going on a dinner cruise-the odyssey at navy pier ) the hotel is a short walk . . . unless you are wearing heels ) to navy pier . we found out on the way home only a N cab ride ) worth N to your blisters ! ! its also only a short walk to michigan ave shopping . . . for comfortable shoes perhaps ? ? i chose this hotel because of location , but the views are also terrific . this time we had a lake view of navy pier , but our previous trip we had a river and lake view . both very nice . the hotel is very nice . several restaurants , although we haven ' t tried them . the burger place downstairs sure smelled good though ) we ended up at bubba gumps at navy pier . good ! the rooms were very spacious and clean ! ! i am kind of a germaphobe ! so clean is important for my sanity ) the bottom level has doors that leads right out to the riverwalk , and a cool water fountain . ) i obviously highly recommend this hotel ) i N chicago 
i stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the chicago bears fan convention ( feb N- march N ) . the hotel is beautiful . i had a towers room . i had a decent view of the city ( sears tower ) . the room was a little small but had two bathrooms ( N king bed ) . the tower room has it ' s own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast , evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day . the registration lounge is on the Nth floor and overlooks lake michigan . the hotel was full but service was excellent . the location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two ( especially toward the el train ) . we loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car . i will stay here again . hilton offered a sunday night free on their website with a N day stay . this made the cost reasonable ( for chicago ) . however , the pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired . the pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink . 
i have recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel and although i have stayed there a variety of times before , for both business and pleasure , my experience this time was particularly poor . from right when i checked in to the day i left i felt like i was constantly around unfriendly people who didn ' t want to be at work their to do their jobs . my room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day , and when i was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways , i couldn ' t sleep . for my next visit to chicago i won ' t be staying at the hyatt regency . 
my experience with the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was terrible ! i arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour . i chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed i sat for N minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink i received was warm . when the room was finally ready i was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding . when i called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom . after all this hassle i would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered i found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee N . N for a N hour period . i was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels i have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access . overall i was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel any time soon . 
location is excellent , but don ' t valet your car there , ( N . N a day ) . bed was to soft , pillows were flat , we couldn ' t open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way . all in all not what you ' d expect from a hotel in that area . 
just returned to seattle after a visit home to chicago and i loved the james ! ! ! recently stayed at the ritz at water tower and the dana around the corner--both of which were great but the james was perfect . secured the room through a package w american express for a great deal so though the view wasn ' t great the space , decor and location can ' t be beat . staff was friendly , courteous and very helpful , the gym was substantial and though i didn ' t try the restaurants room service , the menus looked yummy . i ' ve stayed in chgo in that area on avg N-Ns mo over the past three years and the james is at the top my list now . if you can get a good deal , i highly recommend ! ! 
my husband and i wanted to spend the weekend in chicago to celebrate our anniversary , and i had been looking at the james for awhile because it was attached to david burke ' s primehouse . from the moment i called to make my reservation , i knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that . from the pre-arrival dossier , to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the james , this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service . the rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend . the walking distance to michigan av is a huge plus . from the front desk to the cleaning staff , the staff here is top notch ! and david burke ' s primehouse is not to be missed ! 
the omni chicago really delivers on all fronts , from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on michigan avenue . while this address in chicago requires a high level of quality , the omni delivers . check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under N minutes , the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events , and the rooms are some of the largest you ' ll find at this price range in chicago . even the ' standard ' room has a separate living area and work desk . the fitness center has free weights , weight machines , and two rows of cardio equipment . i shared the room with N others and did not feel cramped in any way ! all in all , a great property ! 
i stayed at the fairmont chicago for one night - i ' m a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals . i checked in late ( almost Npm ) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- atlanta . i took the shuttle to the airport ( best option in lieu of the over priced taxis ) , and it was my first time staying at the hotel . upon arrival , i immediately noticed the entrance , which appeared very welcoming and warm to me . i checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if i ' d prefer a king or double ( reconfirming my reservation preference ) . i always take the king when i can , and the bed was fantastic ! it was suited with great linen and these incredible down feather pillows named encompass made by the pillow factory -- i checked the tags , since i plan to buy some ! i ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - aria , which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and yes , it does stand out all on it ' s own . the food is asian fusion , and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie , i appreciate great food when i taste it ! the hotel service was good as well . only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely . they missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet , which tasted a bit ' metallic ' . but they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after i passed on the buffet . i would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view ( if you can get a room with one ) , fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet . 
i went to chicago on business last year and i had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious hyatt regency hotel . i opted for the business plan , although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from , such as the allergy friendly , monarch suite , state suite , all the way up to the presidential suite . my suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort , equipped with wi-fi , a generous N inch television , spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body . i dined at the stetson ' s chop shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared . the staff was curtious and accommodating . for breakfast , i opted to have my meal brought to my room where i started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong , gourmet coffee . i would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight chicago stay . 
the omni chicago hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever had the oppertunity to visit . not only are the desk clerks very helpful , but you feel like a celebrity when you visit . the workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp . they also have a great indoor pool and a spa . it also comes with N sundecks to get a nice tan . if you need a vacation , this is the place to stay . 
i stayed at the allegro for several days in august N and i would defintely stay again . i had a very large room with a huge bathroom , although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout . the lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges , a nice place to enjoy the simple ( N choices , no munchies ) but pleasant wine reception . at night , there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity , other than theater traffic , but it ' s a short cab ride to michigan avenue shopping and river north restaurants . 
attended a conference at the palmer house and it truly surpassed my expectations . i had no idea it would be so large , so nice and with so many amenities . i also didn ' t realize that it is just around the corner from milenium park and the art institute . we were met at the door by the friendliest staff . even with a long line at check-in , the entire process was about N minutes . we enjoyed the room with the up-to-date tv , decent size bathroom and comfortable bed . had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant . paid N night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown chicago . we have stayed at the sofital which is much more upscale , but we also paid over N night there . 
how should i start ? well , after staying at the ambassador east hotel , i realized it was my favorite hotel ever . the rooms are amazing . the food is great . the pump room bar is awesome . i love this hotel . if your ever in chicago , the ambassador east hotel is the place to go . 
great hotel . went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time . the hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at . beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery . great staff and wonderfull food as well , i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work . 
i recently had my wedding at the omni hotel in chicago and i was more than pleased . the decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one , i was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once i met with the staff at the omni i was certain that it was the way to go . the staff was so attentive and friendly , and i felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel . i highly recommend the omni hotel in chicago , brides will not be dissapointed ! 
october Nrd , N my wife and i stayed at the sofitel toward the end of september N . the hotel is very modern . the room was immaculate , but the furiture looked as though it came from ikea . it was chipped in many places . the light switches were difficult to find , and the hvac made noise . however , the bed was wonderful . the bathroom was large and well maintained . housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted . the restaurant was small . you can eat for less at a N hour restaurant around the corner called tempo . if you want a truly great breakfast try the peninsula hotel . however , after dining there you might not want to return to the sofitel . prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full . when we checked in , we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals . upon returning home , we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the sofitel had an authorization placed on it . this reduced the line of credit , and it took several days to be removed from the card . great location ! reasonable value . if you have a privilege card they allow you to check out at Npm as opposed to N in the afternoon . 
my husband and i were planning our Nst year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in chicago where we had first met . after spending several minutes frustratingly navigating the talbott hotel ' s website , i finally was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend . after a long flight into chicago , we were so ready to check in , shower , and lay down in our hotel room . however , once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation . i provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied . she begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting . we then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door . i ' m severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel . 
for the price , you would think this would be a top quality hotel , but it was nowhere close . service at check-in was slow and unfriendly . the room was even worse . it was small , dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though i had requested a non-smoking room . the cover on the bed was stained , there was hair all over the bathroom floor , and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall . everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel . i also didn ' t appreciate having to pay for wifi , when other premium hotels offer it for free . overall , this was one of the worst hotels i have stayed at in a long time , and considering the price , it was terrible . 
my husband and i stayed at the hyatt regency chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary . we could not have picked a better locate . the price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget . the flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine . my husband loved the stetson steakhouse and the N hour stay fit gym . we really did not leave the hotel during i stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away . if we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay . this hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and i . what a wonderful ten years celebration . 
your website wowed me enough to book online although i had never used your hotel . i had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to chicago and i was very disappointed . the first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk . we had to wait a long time to get checked in . when we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom . the maid hadn ' t finished the room and she ' d left her stuff behind ! of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle . the next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one . we knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled , non barking pets . this animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep . i called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped . i think the dog just gave up because it didn ' t sound like the desk staff knew what to do . the crowning disaster , at least for my kids and husband , was that the remote control for the tv was dead . we managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake . your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great . i cannot recommend it to anyone . 
problems started when i booked the intercontinental chicago online at the hotel ' s site , and got a server error . somehow i managed to get my reservation , and wish i had looked elsewhere on this great chicago street , filled with plenty of other options . the server errors continued at check in and didn ' t let up . i was on a holiday weekend , but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers , and i had trouble getting served . the hotel is enormous and doesn ' t give a sense of comfort . the health facilities are also just too big , so noisy and crowded . and internet access was N a day , kind of surprising when i can go around the corner to a starbucks ! next time , i ' ll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many ' server errors ' . 
conrad chicago it was N N am my plan just flew in and i was tired i checked myself into the confad chicago when i first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but i got my room in the Nth level of then as i dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand i entered it then that ' s where i started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small ac heater unit and it was good . then out of no where ting i made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel i found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob i was living in paradise after i got into my room it was a perfect ! the room was a perfect N degrees . i was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was . . . perfect ! and it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when i didn ' t think it could get any better i look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold ! the water actually has a good taste to it like grapes i was so shocked i fell uncontentious i was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then i woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there ! i when t back up into my floor and guess what i say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge olympic sized swimming pool it was great . i got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all i don ' t think i can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much . then came dinner time perfect . i must say i am extremely satisfied with my visit ! time to fly back to where i cam from and then my plan took off i ' m going to miss that hotel N N ! 
i was going to chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops . i did some research and believed the intercontinental would suit my needs . i sure was not disappointed by my decision ! this hotel lots of historic charm . despite being a larger hotel , the service was top shelf ! the rooms , while not large by any means , were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable . my kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered . as for me , i was more impressed with the location to the magnificent mile . the hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site . the food was very good and , just like the hotel itself , the restaurant provided perfect customer service . dollar for dollar , the intercontinental in chicago is a great deal and i will be staying there again . 
this was the best choice my husband and i could have chosen to visit ! the hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water ! i was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym . everything was so clean and invoting . especially the pump room there was so much history in one rooom . overall , we had a great , relaxing vacation away from the kids . i would definitely return to the ambassador next time we ' re in the area ! 
staff were friendly , room was well kept like a typical hyatt location . hotel is huge , with two buildings and over N rooms . good location , close to michigan ave and the subway . parking is N day . ouch ! i bid on it on priceline for N . 
great location in chicago downtown . the staff is professional and warm . the room is spacious and clean . nice complimentartry breakfast . i will definitely stay here again next time in chicago . 
this hotel has a great location , and very friendly staff . however , the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition . i use to be a regular at this hotel . . . but have not been back for N years . rooms have not been well maintained ( old carpets frayed at doors ) , wall paper peeling off of the walls , tv ' s from the N ' s . there is currently construction going on in the lobby area , making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door . 
i was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel . the walls were paper thin , and i could hear conversations in the next room . this is not something i would have expected from a higher class of hotel . the room was also smaller than i would have expected for the price . we were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room , something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning . we requested new towels , but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request . the check-in process was frustrating , mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter . i don ' t know if she was having a bad day , or just happens to be in such a mood all the time , but either way , it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with . overall , not a pleasant experience . i think next time , we ' ll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting chicago . 
the thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable . the room was very clean , the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot . other than that it was a great place to stay . 
if there is ever a hotel you should stay at it is the sheraton chicago hotel and towers . this is the most beautiful hotel i have ever seen . this hotel has more than you will ever need or want . you can pick from a room that is decorated in great taste . there is a in room refreshment center , high speed internet , N inch television , coffer maker with great coffee from starbucks . you could get a suite or the presidential suite with more room than you will ever need . the room is over N square feet . it over looks the chicago river . there is plenty of activities with a great fitness center and a big indoor heated pool . the sauna was just wonderful . if you want to sight see in the area you can walk to the navy pier , or art institute . when you come back hungry you can eat at the elegant steakhouse which had some of the best food we ever ate . have a few drinks at the great bar , then create your own burger at the chicago burger company . the staff was very friendly and super helpful . the hotel was the cleanest i have ever seen . i will come again and again . a big thumbs up to this great hotel . 
perfect location , clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay . its in an area with plenty of stores ( the mile ) and restaurants . hotel lobby is on the Nth floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall i would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family , friends or on business . the subway to wrigley is a N N block away from the front door . 
hotel monaco is simply amazing . i travel quite a bit , and am use to generic hotels , with horribly unimpressive rooms , and ' N star amenities ' which usually mean a packet of instant coffee , and room service that won ' t serve after Npm . hotel monaco on the other hand was very impressive . the suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy . this hotel has such personality . my absolute favorite part of my stay , aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs , was the in-room spa treatment . hotel monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me . generic just won ' t do anymore . 
this is the best hotel to stay in when visiting chicago . i travel a lot , both for business and vacation . the talbott hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome , and elegant . not to mention all the modern features that i ' m used to having at home , are available in the room . i brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite . she didn ' t even want to leave the room . the concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner . 
i recently had the displeasure of staying at the conrad chicago . although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites , my experience was anything but pleasent . first of all , they tell you that check in time is at Npm . well i arrived at the hotel at N Npm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready . after waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready , i decided to go settle in . the carpets in the room smelled old and musty . additionally , the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips , scratches , and dents in the furniture . although the bed was comfortable , i just couldn ' t get over the musty smell coming from the carpet . it was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and i did not have a very good nights sleep . all in all , my experience was not the worst i ' ve ever had , but far from anything worth writing home about . 
my wife and i live in the western suburbs of chicago . for our anniversary , we booked a night at the fairmont based on recommendations from friends . while the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city , the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations . for starters , we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive . however , the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us . while the room was certainly adequate , the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included . while the latter may seem like a minor offense , it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality . finally , the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for chicago ' s standards . in summary , the fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price , i am sure we could of done better . 
we stayed in the conrad for N nights just before thanksgiving . we had a corner room overlooking n michigan av and the tribune building . to say this is a N star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful . the staff were unbelievably helpful . the standard of the room was superb - hd plasma screens , luxury bedlinens , ipod radio , huge bathroom . location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole light festival parade from the window . breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service . would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - N out of N . 
hyatt regency chicago seemed like a nice place to stay , but we didn ' t like it very much . the renovations were cheap and poorly done ( our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it . ) the staff was rude ! i was trying to find a good cab service , and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for N minutes while he was finishing a phone call ! couldn ' t he have at least called someone else to help me ? the ' babies travel lite ' gave us the wrong sized diapers , so we had to go find some anyway , and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way . 
my wife and i were very much looking forward to our stay at the hotel allegro in chicago . we had been looking forward to a romantic getaway . i have to say hotel allegro was a disappointment for both of us . this is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in . but we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given . in the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover . very shocking for the price we were paying . when we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by . past this - the room itself - it has flair i guess , but i can ' t imagine it is the right flair for many . the colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow , designy wallpaper . neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all . i can ' t imagine many would . it really was off-putting . overall , the experience was a check minus in my book . will not be looking to return any time soon . 
my family stayed at this hotel and walking into the lobby i expected a very good experience . once i made my way to the counter and was greeted ( not really ) i knew this may be a bad experience . the customer service person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes . once i got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out . the high chair that we requested still had spots of food on it . the rest room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper . after we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid . luckily we only had to stay there one day . one day was almost too long . 
my stay at the sofitel was great . i loved the location it was in . from the moment i arrived the experince was great , the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too . i thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable . the room service was excllent and they were very friendly . checkout was a breeze and i couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay . 
my boyfriend and i were amazed by the breathtaking view of lake michigan ! we are from texas so the view of the city was very important to us . we had no problems at this hotel . . . rooms , service , location were top notch . 
my husband and i recently stayed at your hard rock hotel in chicago , and what a fantastic experience it was . we stayed in one of the ' extreme suites ' and let me tell you it was beautiful . the furniture and paintings were amazing and the view was to die for . the staff treated us really well and met all of our needs and then some . i especially loved the spa . we stayed for a week but i could have stayed a lot longer . it was very comfortable and welcoming . we will make sure to recommend your hotel to our friends and will be back the next time we are in chicago . thanks so much ! 
the intercontinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure . nestled deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown chicago , the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm . from the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites , the intercontinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler . book well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of chicago . 
i have to say that the hard rock hotel in chicago is a cool place to stay . when i first got there , getting checked in was very fast . the lady at the counter was nice and well spoken . the bellhop had out bags into the room very fast . the room was very hip and cool . there was musical items all over the place . i really loved the beatles art that was in my bathroom . after being in the room a few minutes , i got a call from the front desk asking me if i liked my room . they also asked me if i would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if i needed to use their business room . i needed some things shipped while i was there , which they had supplies to help me with that . after getting some work done , i called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around . they gave me information for N awesome places . i left and came back after having a night out on the town . they were very understanding that i was a wee bit out of it . i had more than pizza that night if you get my drift . when i got back to my room , the bed was so comfortable . i feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep . in the morning i order breakfast , which was really a philly cheese steak . they will make anything you want anytime of day . i checked out by Nam with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed . thank you hard rock , you rock ! 
went there for business and the hard rock hotel on wacker drive was recommended . i was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived N hour before me . when she go there at Npm , the room wasn ' t ready , the phone didn ' t work , the shower didn ' t work . when i got there she was already very upset . i called the manager to complain , but was put on hold for N min . i could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasn ' t any wall separating us . i asked for a wake up call , but nobody called me the next morning . when i called to complain the next day , the told me the phone system was down . ordered room service and got the wrong order . . . the building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath . . . i would not recommend it to anyone patrick 
my husband and i stayed here at the hard rock hotel in chicago a few months back . i wasn ' t particularly impressed with their customer service . when we arrived to check in , the front desk clerk was quite rude and unfriendly . she was short with me when i asked her about the city ' s attractions and things to do . our room wasn ' t all that great either . it was rather small and had a weird smell to it . i won ' t be staying here again . 
couldn ' t have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown chicago . hotel sofitel is right in the heart of the action , allowing my friends and i to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown ' s famous for . the room was comfy , with two queen mattresses , down stuffed duvets and chic decor . the bar downstairs was a bit pricey , but made up for it by being comfortable , sleek , and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails . one night we didn ' t feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the cafe des architectes , which had an amazing array of choices , mostly of the french persuasion . i would definitely book here again ! 
i loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown chicago , an older hotel with a great reno ( a bit over-the-top design , but still very lovely and charming ) , clean rooms , and very friendly staff . they ' re also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our Nlb mastiff cross with a gift bag ( treats and directions to an off-leash area ) , and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog ' s names on it . 
let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take N-N trips for pleasure on a yearly basis ( not including our business travel ) . we ' ve traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail . we were not at all impressed by this hotel . at N night we were expecting a decent , clean hotel but obviously not a N . we were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given ( N ) . the paint wallpaper tub were peeling , there was hair in both the tub toilet when we got to the room , the internet service was extremely slow , the toilet ran throughout the night , and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in . we told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was ' i know , we can ' t wait for our renovations . ' if it hadn ' t been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the uk booked into this hotel by a travel agent , we would have checked out as soon as we checked in . let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in check-out process was painfully slow . all we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly responsive door staff . in its day this was likely a lovely hotel but it is in dire need of a renovation . despite its location i cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience . we would never book at this hotel again . 
just back from spending memorial day weekend in chicago . we decided to stay at the talbott , and we reserved a room there over a month ago . i must say that we found the staff to be wonderful , but the accommodations to be quite disappointing . we were given room N . avoid this room at all costs ! the adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night ( and then awaken you at N am ) . in addition , we had requested a king bed , and N has two doubles . we were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room . despite the very friendly staff and its super location , the talbott was less than what we expected , and we would probably not stay there again . 
i stayed at the hilton chicago back in july . for a ' luxury ' hotel this place did not meet my expectations . for starters , we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn ' t be ready for at least another hour ! i ' m used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee . since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel ' s restaurants , kitty o ' sheas . well , we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks . once we finally got to our room it was ok , although not great for the price . we had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view , and there were not extra towels as i had requested . we had to call room service twice to receive them , then another two times because our air conditioner wasn ' t working . fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so i could barely use internet on my phone . next time i ' m in the chicago area i won ' t be staying at the hilton . i ' d only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money . 
we booked this hotel using points on our credit card . when we arrived , we were immediately greeted by a friendly face . we arrived several hours before check-in . however , they let us check-in early . they also gave us a free room upgrade . the hotel is absolutely stunning ! in addition , it is off of state street . there are many things to do - shopping , dinning , theater . it is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the united center or the airport . the hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge . the room was so dark and quiet we slept in . 
this was a wonderful stay . the staff was extremely helpful , the rooms are especially large , and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy . the breakfast and supper were excellent . they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for instance , they have take-away plates you can take up to your room . the business center , gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in chicago . 
very nice hotel , better than expected . the hot breakfast is great in the morning , but the dinner at night goes above and beyond ( even free wine ! ) the rooms are pretty good size , well furnished , and clean . i liked the view from my room . i used the fitness center and although did not have everything i would have liked , was adequate . i will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view . the staff was friendly and helpful being my first time in chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration . i would definitely recommend this hotel . 
i stayed here for business and loved it . got it for N inc tax on priceline , an incredible deal for this hotel . if i wasn ' t on priceline i would expect to pay N per night ( maybe more ) for this location level of service . it ' s in the heart of downtown chicago , walkable to many locations . the lobby is very impressive , the room was very nice . no complaints at all , from check-in to check-out . i was alone so didn ' t go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves . it was full of people all the time . i want to stay here when i come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city . 
my fiance and i had taken a trip to chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to downtown , so he chose the amalfi hotel , located conveniently to everything we needed . this place was phenomenal ! ! ! he chose a romantic getaway package , as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever . the hotel is super clean and very chic the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb . we were able to bring along our dog , which was also really important to us . the first day we were there , we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple ' s massage . the masseuses come straight to your room so it ' s really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great . after our massages , we went to the keefer steakhouse , which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic . they do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the rocket grill , which was nice as well . in all , our N nights there were pretty similar , we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there i ' ve recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the windy city . 
i stayed here N nights for a business conference . the food was pretty good . and they had these really good mints that i couldn ' t resist . the room was very comfortable and the bed was great . but i was annoyed by many issues . first , their internet went down for a couple of hour when i was there on a break from the conference . it wouldn ' t have been big deal except i needed to do some business while it was down . second , the internet wasn ' t available in the conference rooms . i suppose the conference i attended would have had to pay extra for it . third , the chair in the room was too low for the desk so i was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later . fourth , on the second night my key didn ' t work . so i asked for a new one which also didn ' t work . so i asked for another one and the same thing happened . thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so i didn ' t have to go back down to the lobby a third time . then he came back a little later to tell me i was in the wrong room , which i wasn ' t . finally , he came back with the right key . fifth , the tv had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume . sixth , they didn ' t have the comedy channel . much cheaper hotels do . if this hotel didn ' t cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences , but i would expect more for what i paid . 
we have just returned from N nights at the conrad chicago , everthing about the hotel was excellent . wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class . great view from our room . the hotels location is great , right in the centre of the magnificent mile . a wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the conrad . 
as a frequent traveler to chicago , i generally stay at the sutton court , but thought i would try a different boutique hotel . i will never stay at this hotel again . the first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet , leaving me absolutely claustrophobic ! actually the smallest hotel room i ' ve been in in the u . s ! i complained to the front desk , who then moved me to a ' premium ' room -- still quite small , but manageably so . the bathroom was tiny , without a vanity , making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room . the location leaves much to be desired , as my room looked out directly onto the el ( elevated subway - background noise ) , and the street was pretty deserted on a sunday evening . i will say that the free wi-fi was great . if you can find a chain or other hotel closer to michigan avene , i ' d highly recommend you take that . if you want a nice room in a great location , check out sutton place hotel instead . 
do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room , that was supposed to be ready , with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used ? what about when they left the towel for the floor ( the foot towel ) to dry my face ? what about the slippers that , although being still in the bag , had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage ( all over the room , de facto ) . i didn ' t realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her . shame on us , actually ! 
my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro chicago to celebrate our Nnd wedding anniversary this past weekend . the hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive . the concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay , and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do . we were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel the lobby , dining areas , and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury . the decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white , and lighting that complimented and set the mood . the bar and lounge areas had excellent service , and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown chicago . additionally , my husband and i were extra pleased to learn that because we are aaa members , we would be receiving N off our room rate for the weekend . overall , the amenities and experience of staying at the hotel allegro chicago made us feel like movie stars , pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment , one in which we would definitely choose to stay again . 
 if you are traveling to chicago and need a place to stay , i highly recommend the hotel allegro chicago . it was visiting time visiting chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the hotel allegro . he said they were pet friendly , which was a huge plus . this is because i hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time i travel for business . upon my arrival , i was met with friendly valet who treated me like i was the only customer who mattered . i walked in and saw a hotel like no other i have seen before or after . the lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place i could relax in . after i had entered and checked in , i saw the staircase , which looked like a testament to the staircase in the ' titanic ' . frankly , i was amazed and i had not even entered my room yet . my room was a queen deluxe room and it was amazing . the bed had a blue headboard , which i have never seen before , and the colors worked together so well i seriously contemplated living there . the room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food i ordered . later i wanted to get a drink and i enjoyed it at the bar N , which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel . these are the specifics of my stay , but there is much more to be experienced that i did not mention if you visit the hotel allegro . in summary , they allow pets , the service is amazing , the decoration superb , and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments . what more could a person ask for ? 
not impressed at all . the hotel itself looks really nice , especially in the big foyer area . our room was small , and the bathroom needed some major upgrades . it had the green tile , like at your grandmother ' s house , all over the walls , and N people couldn ' t fit in it if you tried . we could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning , so obvioulsy the walls aren ' t so thick . our room looked directly on to a brick building outside , very close , we couldn ' t even tell if it was nice outside or not . we are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it , and i felt yucky the whole time in it . i just wouldn ' t pay lots of money to stay here , there is nothing exceptional about it at all . 
my boyfriend and i decided to stay at the conrad chicago for our anniversary . the second we walked in , we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room . white luxurous bedding on the king bed , plasma t . v . subroofer surround sound speakers ( my boyfriend was more impressed than me , as i reminded him that we didn ' t come to chicago for the hotel room ) very large bathroom w tub and separate stand-in shower , granite countertops , his her robes and slippers . the view wasn ' t great , but we were on the Nth floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us . not a large room by any means , but again . . . we didn ' t go to the city for the hotel room . it was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room . we got a great rate on it ( N at hotels . com ) but i think the going rate is usually closer to mid N ' s . i ' ve stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one . we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city . 
the elevator system was impossible . it seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse . many people waited N minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells . it happened several times . i had read about it before booking but guess i didn ' t take it seriously . it ' d be a deal breaker for any future return unless i heard clearly it was improved . also , i always think it ' s lame that you have to pay extra for wifi . area recommendations north michigan avenue and lake front areas are best . 
our first visit to chicago and i really cannot wait to go back . the hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful . particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful . the room was clean , quiet and spacious , if only every hotel were like this . 
the international chicago magnificent mile is shrouded in glamour , but underneath the facade fades away . the ' classical architectural landmark ' should be translated to ' old and boring . i found this hotel via google and have regretted it ever since . room size was small and unaccommodating , and that was one of the newer rooms ! everything was free except for the gym ( why that wouldn ' t be free with the price i paid i don ' t know ) . this hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get , and i would not recommend staying there . 
we stayed here through hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- N some odd dollars nightly for a N night stay last may . the room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel , but it was very clean , tastefully decorated and cozy . we had a great vacation , walking all over town until we ended up near the planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of chicago and were just wow . so anyway , the hotel is great , the service was great , the room was very nice- i would recommend this hotel to anyone though i work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person ' s comment about how she wasn ' t able to get adjoining rooms , well , internet sites don ' t guarantee things like that anyway- you ' ve got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that . there ' s a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type location is guaranteed . N stars out of N for this hotel . 
i had such a horrible experience when i stayed at omni chicago hotel last saturday night . first of all , the plasma tv in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available , and they weren ' t particularly apologetic about it , either . secondly , it was supposedly a non-smoking hotel , but as an ex-smoker , i can tell that people had smoked in the room recently . additionally , the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels , which was really disappointing , because i was looking forward to using the pool . finally , check-out was supposed to be at noon . at N N am , the maid was knocking at the door . she asked if i would be out soon , and i thought was very quite intrusive . i will never , ever stay at that place again . 
quite simply the hyatt regency chicago is the business traveler ' s best friend . recently i had to attend a seminar in chicago and stayed at the hyatt . to say i was impressed would be an understatement . centrally located in the heart of downtown , the hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction . on arrival the staff goes into overdrive . they make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel . the rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with N percent cotton linens . my room came equipped with flat screen tv , wi-fi and high speed internet . room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you . there were also car rental on site as were restaurants , cocktail bar and a N hour dining room . they have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features . there is also catering and limo service . the staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional . all in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between . this hotel is definitely worth the price and i will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered . my only regret ? that i could not stay much longer . 
stayed at the chicago hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door i was very impressed . check-in was quick , easy and i was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time . we were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant . it made getting ready to go out much quicker ! the hotel location is great opposite the park , which is a must see . although located on south michigan ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of michigan ave . would also recommend the street one block back from michigan ave for good shopping . for breakfast i would recommend grabbing a muffin , croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant . for evening entertainment kitty o ' sheas is a must . typical irish bar with good drinks and live music . finally the bed at hilton chicago is the most comfortable bed ever . i would have taken it home if i could ! definately made for a good nights sleep . 
i enjoyed a pleasant N night stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago , il . the hotel was beautiful , inside and out . i felt as if i was a celebrity staying there . the staff was especially kind and very professional . my husband and i have never felt more comfortable . i was very pleased that they had transportation for us , since we flew in to chicago for our anniversary . the shedd aquarium package was an excellent bonus . i highly recommend this hotel to everyone that ' s going to be visiting chicago ! 
warning food poisoning alert ! ! ! the room was dirty , the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on . the elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it . they hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for . what was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick . the one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue . the second night we left and went to another hotel which was N bucks cheaper and N times nicer . do not stay here 
fantastic stay ! the hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean . i chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was very close to my business conference . here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown chicago charm . be sure to try the ribs at south water kitchen next door . they are the best i ' ve ever had . ever ! if youre in the mood to unwind , you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around . i had a great time here . from now on , i won ' t stay anyplace else . 
after checking out of the sofitel chicago water tower the other day , i left the hotel , crossed the street and started to walk eb on chestnut while looking for a cab . i was still within sight of a sofitel doorman when i sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same . after doing so , i immediately heard a sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle . as the cab slowed to pick me up , the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction . when the cab stopped , i quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the sofitel doorman . after locking the door , the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab . after claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs , he suggested that i had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a ' jerk ' before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination . consequently , unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen , please don ' t attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman . lastly , as for the rest of my stay , you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in french instead of english . while i have nothing against the french or french language , i much prefer communicating in english when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . viva la usa ! 
very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view . the dinning selection is one of the best i have seen in chicago . i have stayed many places downtown chicago and nothing matches this . i am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well . the shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors . the biggest thing that i have to say is that the customer service was great with everything that i needed . i give the hotel a N out of N . 
my parents booked five nights at the james for its location and good reviews . they had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff . they sent engineers three times to repair the unit , and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn ' t , under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty . at my parents ' request , the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort . the hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room . don ' t book this hotel in the summer . and by the way , there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings . 
i accompanied my husband on a business trip to chicago back in september and we stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel . the place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm ! also , there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance , so i shopped while my husband worked . it just doesn ' t get any better than that ! i loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel , and i ' d definitely stay there again ! 
stayed in april for two nights . i hesitated selecting the sheraton becaue i had a very poor stay there earlier this year . as far as i ' m concerned , that ' s two strikes and i won ' t give them a chance at three . doormen wouldn ' t help on arrival , huge line at c i , lousy room , malfunctioning remote , unresponsive staff , and incorrect bill . if you want to be close to michigan ave , try the westin or intercontinental and spare yourself the problems . i don ' t understand why certain places never improve . is it that tough to properly train a staff ? 
we booked N rooms for N nights on hotwire over labor day weekend . we arrived at the hard rock at around N N a . m . , and they were able to give us our rooms early . hooray ! we were on the Nth floor ( beatles theme ) . the rooms were very comfortable . one of our rooms was on a corner , and had lots of windows . the other was was a bit larger with fewer windows . not a great view from our side of the hotel , but we didn ' t pay for a room with a view . the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable , the bathroom was full of aveda products , and there was a bathrobe in the closet . the tv dvd stereo combo was nice , but we weren ' t in the room a lot to use it . we were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks drinks as they were weighted and we ' d be charged . no problems there . we did not make use of the free fitness center , because the weather was perfect . my husband was able to go for a run through grant park along the waterfront instead . he said it was wonderful . we did use the free internet in our rooms . it was ' wired ' internet , but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway . the room was a bit dim at night , but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps . there was virtually no hall elevator noise . the location of the hard rock is ideal . it is easy to get breakfast at the corner bakery , just blocks to either grant park , the art institute , state street shopping , or michigan ave . to sum up , there was absolutely nothing to complain about . we would be glad to stay here again any time . 
the omni chicago hotel was in one word , dreadful . the hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic . the service is terrible . if you want to wait for your room for N and a half hours this is the place to go ! throughout a whole week , beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned . the hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit , they give no info for any activities going on in chicago . this hotel should be listed in the top N worst hotels in america . do not waste your time nor money staying at the omni chicago hotel . 
i am so glad i decided to stay at the intercontinental chicago for my first trip to the city . the staff is very attentive , i felt like i was the only person they had to take care of ! the location is great , right on the magnificent mile and so close to major attractions . my suite was well appointed and very clean . i even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn ' t find any . the hotel is very luxurious . the sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable . the next time i travel to chicago , i will definitely stay at the intercontinental again . 
i just came back from this awesome , terrific hotel last week , and i have to say-- i loved it ! my wife and i were there for a week due to a business meeting , and right when i stepped into the hotel , i knew that this business vacation will be well spent . the customer service was very great , and an employee even guided us toward our room ! we were introduced to a fantastically lit room with N beds , a flat screen tv , and even free internet access . my wife loved it , and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap . when i headed down to the lobby for my conference , i got lost , and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held . he leaded me to the door , and i was very impressed . there is a fitness center which i went everyday , and this great restaurant called c-house situated nicely next to the hotel lobby , where i had a nice steak and my wife a salad . all in all , i thought that the trip was really worth it , and my stay was very welcoming at the affinia chicago . i highly recommend that whenever you visit chicago you should stay there , you will not regret it . 
the reviews we read were a bit mixed , but i thought it was excellent . i ' ve stayed in the splendido , villa d ' este and others and it doesn ' t compare , but nor should it . it doesn ' t claim to be in that space . i expected it to be a notch off the four seasons and so it proved . a only a small notch too ! . lovely clean and bright room . superb views , very quiet , comfy bed etc . excellent service all round and nice staff . for the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed . couldn ' t really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the four seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience . we will go there again when in chicago . great location too . 
three nights there on business . hadn ' t realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement , very bleak . told the front desk that i hadn ' t realized about the construction , so i ' d have to switch hotels , they said they were still going to charge me for N nights . so i stayed . tv didn ' t work . tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me . . . eventually after i called again , a few hours later , a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it . long and complicated experience at the business center ( which doesn ' t open until Nam , btw ) , where i ended up paying N to print N pages . had to buy these cards , and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway , ( and charging me for them ) . i was left with N on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the swissotel in chicago , N miles from where i live . i asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that . nice room , nice view , but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad . worst experience i ' ve ever had at a hotel when traveling for business . 
this is a stylish hotel located right on north michigan avenue , a five minute walk from the orange ' loop ' line that will get you to and from midway airport . forget about taking a taxi the train is a N ride and less than N minutes away . our room ( N ) was immaculate and spacious ( N sq ft , we were told ) . decorated in grays and white , the room was comfortable and soothing , not jarring . on the other hand , we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading , finding keys , etc . no kidding . the bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp . on the positive side , however , there were aveda products in the bathroom , the windows were huge , so during the day there was tons of natural light , and no issues with darkness . the king size bed was very firm , but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting . we had a largish tv with a dvd player . there is a safe and munchies . the gym is perfect , equipped with treadmills , ellipticals , bikes and weights . it is open N N and there is video surveillance for safety . there are towels , water , headphones , disposable ear pads , and complimentary green apples . suggestion if you are on a floor below the Nnd , take the elevator up to Nnd , then down to lN to get to the gym . this way you dont have to traverse the lobby . the front desk staff is amiable , and very attentive . i read some other reviews about nasty personnel , but did not have that experience at all . i got a free newspaper with a smile , a free stamp when i needed it , change and all the coffee i could tolerate in the morning . the hard rock is located less than a N minute walk from the water tower , the drury theater , john hancock , and magnificent mile . for those who like a thrifty breakfast , we recommend gourmet pantry at N n . michigan avenue -- . this deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a sunday morning , no less N . N . the hotel has a breakfast buffet for N . N per person , but we did not partake of it . we would stay at the hard rock again , and think it is great for people with ' tweens . ' not sure about the toddler set , though . 
the talbott hotel was very classy , professional , and luxurious . i loved how the staff was nice and respectful . i was treated like i was royalty when i was there , when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel . they took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done . this is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area . i have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area . 
the james hotel in chicago is by far one of the best hotels that my family and i have ever had the pleasure of staying at . the room service is the best in the area , not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for . the lobby and the reception area is very contemporary . this is a great place to take the family to relax . i would recommend this hotel to anyone . N stars ! 
over-hyped and over-priced . the fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at N doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a N star hotel . the hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadn ' t been cleaned . . . well , ever . the decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed . the decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again . the bed was the most uncomfortable thing i have every tried to sleep on . i couldnt sleep the whole week that i stayed there . it was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny . my final say is that it is an over priced holiday inn . . . . . 
advertised as a luxury hotel the conrad chicago is more gouge than grand . my wife and i decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in chicago for our tenth anniversary . after looking at several hotels in the ' magnificent mile ' territory of downtown chicago we selected the conrad . the conrad ' s website impressed us immediately . the pictures of the rooms were lovely , they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions , not that we were planning to watch much tv . we called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system , i was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn ' t figure out how i was unable to make my reservations via the automated system . in any case i picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid september . my wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online , most impressed with the view . it cost a pretty penny , more than i would normally spend on out of town accomidations , but her happiness was worth it . unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the conrad . valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife ' s purse when unloading the luggage . we spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it . at the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system . i explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost . by the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay . that ended when we found out that our ' view ' was of a back alley service corridor . so much for the skyline . overall , the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow . i hate to be picky but i was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up . the spa had very limited hours as well . somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams , away from the hotel . it was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count . i would not recommend the conrad chicago . i would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in chicago . i was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms , but wouldn ' t have cleaned out so much of my wallet . 
last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to chicago . when looking for a hotel we weren ' t all that interested in price , but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown . i did some research and and came across the amalfi hotel chicago . what sparked my interest was it ' s location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments . located in chicago ' s river north area , it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours , both of which were fantastic ! after a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments . my wife got the whole works ( facial , manicure and pedicure , and hot stone massage therapy ) , while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day ! for dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at harry caray ' s italian steakhouse . best steak i ' ve ever had , hands down . when we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed , put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful N inch hdtv ' s . for anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of chicago , i would recommend the amalfi hotel chicago to anyone . they offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more . 
my stay at the the james was perfect . my room was thoughtfully designed the lighting , the storage space , the bar area , the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at . the staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating . the restaurant ( primehouse ) echoed the above . great service and one of the best steaks i ' ve had in a very long time . 
our stay at the hilton chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure . the staff was super friendly and helpful , the room was very clean and the location was fantastic . the walking track was an especially nice touch . highly recommended ! 
amazing and beautiful ! i stayed two nights here and the room was immaculate . all of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming . the food was delicious and fixed to perfection . the entire hotel was clean , warm and inviting . will definitely stay here again and recommend to any of my friends traveling to the area . 
hotel is placed in downtown chicago what makes it really loud , it is hard to sleep during the night because all the ' city ' noises coming from the outside . the rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures . i stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband , and we supposed to get room with king size bad , but instead we got , two single beds . the stuff isn ' t really very nice either , they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you . 
i reserved the ' rock star ' suite for my boyfriend ' s birthday months and months in advanced . when we arrived at the hotel monaco , they told us that they doubled booked the room . this was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available . they tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant - which we didn ' t even use . i felt we were taken advantage of because we were young . the doorman didn ' t make us feel any better when he told us that it wasn ' t the first time they did this for the ' rock star ' suite . however , the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake i ordered . if it wasn ' t for the room confusion - it would have been a wonderful stay . 
the affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to chicago . my wife and i stayed in an upgraded suite . very large room , that is modern and has all the little touches . the staff was extremely helpful and professional . the location is excellent . the price is a good value for what you get . we simply couldn ' t find anything to criticize . highly recommended ! 
my husband and i came to the ambassador east hotel for my sister ' s wedding . the hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over N guests . when we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were , helping us check and get our guests situated . they were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest ' s rooms . our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed , with a view of the city . we held the rehearsal dinner groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall . after my sister was married in a church downtown , we held the reception in the large banquet hall . again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner , the dj and all of the wedding ' s decorations . we had a great time . ambassador east hotel is highly recommended ! 
my experience at the ambassador east hotel was truly terrible . i went to chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding . this hotel was recommended by the wedding party . it was a terrible choice . despite the special discount we got because of the wedding , the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels . the staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children . my kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason . the place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items . my son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart . overall , i would say i was very displeased with the staff , the hotel ' s attitude towards children , and the expense of the hotel . on the plus side , our window had an excellent view of the city . still , i would not return here again . 
do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business ? then the james hotel in chicago is the place for you . superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight . followed by spacious rooms , luxurious linens , and all-natural kiehl ' s body shampoos and lotions . i absolutely loved my stay at the james hotel in downtown chicago . the bathrooms have raised sinks , and all of the luxurious amenities you would want . i absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch . i felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere . i definitely would stay again , and plan to stay at the james in new york as well 
my stay at the ambassador east hotel was a pleasant one . i loved being able to take a quick stroll to michigan ave for some shopping . i also loved the pump room . what a fun place to hang out and enjoy a blood mary . the front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost . they found me a room immediately even though the city was book up . i thought the rooms were clean and well maintained . the shampoo was great and i decided to take it home with me . i am looking forward to another stay at the ambassador east in the spring when i return to chicago . 
i had a great time here ! it is centerally located in chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent . the staff was amazing and very helpful ! parking was a bit steep , but to be expected . the room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable . the yoga mat rental was wonderful as well ! wonderful and relaxing experience overall . 
our stay at the ambassador east hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant . we enjoyed the location . we could easily walk to the red line or access the bus lines along michigan avenue . we felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on n . state street and dearborn . we walked to Nrd coast cafe , the chicago history museum , and second city from our hotel . our room was spacious and well-kept , and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening . we would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown . we definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place . 
although the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of chicago , it is somewhat expensive , starting at N per night . there are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler . the rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer . the carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas . the views from the rooms are not as great as they could be . the hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature . although the hotel is located on chicago ' s famous michigan avenue , it is a N taxi ride from o ' hare airport and a N taxi ride from midway airport , both rather pricey options . if you chose to drive there , the valet parking charge is a hefty N . again , not very budget friendly . all in all , even though the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago is close to some of the major chicago attractions , it is only an average hotel on many levels . 
striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life . the attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night ' s sleep i ' ve ever experienced in a hotel . gorgeous lcd tv and bose wave machine added to my enjoyment . sofitel is worth the extra ' s . 
this hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat . the first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket . this place looks alright in the lobby , but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in chicago , this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night . clearly the ambassador east hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession . not to mention that it is at least N-N minutes from the airport in traffic . chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached , particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call . 
i first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the affinia chicago hotel where i ' m greeted by name by the concierge . he tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when i booked the stay . he shows me to my room ( paying careful attention to my bags , and ensuring that i needn ' t lift a finger ) sure enough , the down pillow i had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain , which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn ' t literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed . i notice that there ' s a display of champagne and cupcakes ( ! ) atop the dresser and my ' experience kit ' which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks , and a yoga mat . namaste . unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom , i find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower , but a jacuzzi , lined with candles of vanilla , deep enough to bathe a walrus . feeling girlish , i run the water and test before going to dinner . the hotel ' s restraunt c-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you ' re dining with the kings of paradise . or at least eating in the caribbean itself . hmm , i should have brought a date . 
the room looked like a country club prison cell . flat paint on all walls , doors , trims , not especially clean . a platform bed and a long shelf desk with an iron chair . no amenities , no homey touches , nothing on the walls . no room service , no gym , no concierge . the air conditioner clunked off and on all night . on the plus side , the bedding was nice and there was a large screen tv . don ' t waste your money . 
well located and well staffed . the amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay . it lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by . free continental breakfast and evening cocktail . 
we stayed at the swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from aug N to N . i had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife . jaymes ballard , the concierge , made arrange for flowers , early check-in and we had a great room . our room was the Nrd floor with a view facing the city . room was large , everything looked like new , great bed , large bathroom with separate shower , great ammenities . a beautiful bouquet of flowers arrived upon our arrival . the hotel is about N mins from everything , not close but not far from anything . has a great restaurant , N patios outside where i had a cigar . a really nice pool and hot tub on the Nnd floor . i would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to jaymes for making our trip very special . 
in a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood . a small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby , the pump room is a classic place to have a drink . we did not have dinner there so i can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood . it is a short walk to very good shopping and eating . 
the omni chicago hotel is not pretty as they advertise it . first of all , it really difficult to get there because its located in down town chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare . if you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like N minutes for the front desk to take care of you . when i arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in , and i thought the wait time was ridiculous . to make matters worse , i need internet connection and the day i was there they had technical problems and the internet was not working in my room . two hours later they managed it get to work , the connection was still very slow . for my part , the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations . i was disappointed and will never stay there again , if i go back to chicago . if was rating it , i would give it N N star out of N . 
first , several day s prior to my stay , i called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service saturday and sunday . saturday they didn ' t bring breakfast - and when i called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge . when they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing . . and then brought the wrong order again on sunday . i was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service saturday night . the food was limp and uninspired . further , i ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon . when i called in-room dining to request a spoon , i was told one would be forthcoming . N minutes later , a waiter arrived with a menu . when i explained i already had food and i didn ' t need a menu - i needed a spoon , he had the audacity to argue with me . i respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so . another N minutes ( and one bowl of cold soup ) later i decided to call in-room dining back to request ( again ) they send someone with a spoon . they too argued with me and expressed that they ' d already sent someone with a spoon . i explained that they had not - that i had received a menu i didn ' t request , but that no spoon was forthcoming . another N minutes later , a spoon finally arrived . thanks - for charging me N so that i could argue over cold , flavorless food . in addition to the gross customer service , surly attitude , and sorry food , i found the room woefully lacking . it reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on saturday night i woke up from the smell . further , i had specifically requested when i booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators . . . i was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went . 
my son i joined my husband on a work trip . we planned to swim while he was working . we overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in . though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at N pm . we gave up went out for the evening . we had a very noisy sleepless night . we weren ' t facing mi ave , but still heard sirens and i ' m not sure what the other noise was , but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about Nx an hour throughout the entire night . i called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open , so my ( very excited ) son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction . upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crew ' s actions on my insistence she said she ' d look into it . a gentleman called back an hour later said the pool should open at Npm . . . it was Nam . it is now Npm we still haven ' t even seen the pool . we check out tomorrow . we passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to ' swim in chicago . ' needless to say we are very disappointed . 
my wife and i stayed at this hotel at the end of may , N . she came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city . we got a deal on this hotel through travelzoos . N night stay for N night plus we got the full buffet breakfast . the room was wonderful . extremely large king size bed with expansive sitting area . we are used to smaller hotels with little room to move . the bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows . no wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit ( poor taps ) . we could have upgraded to river view for N night but chose not to . we enjoyed the room for what it was . Nnd floor looking south . the buffet breakfast was great . lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs , non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please . great to have breakfast included in night stay . might be a bit dear to pay at N person . it was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast , coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal . concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat , always informative and ready to provide maps , directions , multiple suggestions and even make the reservations . cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs . location was great . blocks from el and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river . if in chicago again , would not hesitate to stay here again . a swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it . 
i work for a software marketing firm , and that job requires me to travel at least N days per year . i spend a large amount of time in hotels . i normally don ' t write reviews for hotels , but the homewood suites by hilton were above and beyond . let ' s start where it matters the rooms . they are top notch . there ' s nothing better than walking in to a clean , beautiful rooms after a long day of travel . the beds are among the best i ' ve ever slept in in hotels . the rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home . the price low . i looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels , and everything else was at least N more expensive . but you don ' t get what you pay for here . you get much more than that ! the location couldn ' t be better . you want to go to a world class restaurant ? that ' s within walking distance . you want a great shopping experience ? again , walking distance . anything else you want ? chances are , it ' s within walking distance . overall , one of the best hotels i ' ve ever stayed in . 
a friend and i stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her birthday . the hotel at first glance was very nice and charming . but , we quickly found out that was not the case . our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in . the bathroom was filthy , it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks ! ! there was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror . there were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room . we immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly , unkempt room . the women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling ' was not smoke ' because that is not permitted in the hotel . we were also told that room was cleaned that day . after several minutes of arguing with her and a manager , we were moved to a another room which took N hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time . we had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us . the food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and way over priced . our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there . all the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests . i will never stay here again and i would never recommend this hotel to any one . 
we enjoyed our stay at the james in chicago very much . the hotel is elegant and uber-modern ! each room simply exudes class . i have never stayed in a nicer hotel , to be honest . the hotel features an upscale restaurant , though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments . there is also a full-service spa at the hotel . the most surprising thing about the james is that pets are allowed our dog didn ' t have to stay at home . how cool is that ? there are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking , N-hour room service , N-hour concierge , shoe shine service , and laundry dry cleaning . the hotel is located right on the magnificent mile , so that location is absolutely superb . you are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world . i would recommend the james to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to chicago . 
first of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all , the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is . then on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room . the room it ' s self is very spacious and clean . the pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel , they never seemed to run out . the service is beyond exceptional . i would recommend staying at homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown to anyone . 
after reading good reviews about i booked a N night stay . checked in late bit called early in the day to assure we ' d have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for N teens . they somehow had us booked for two rooms instead . got that sorted out and arrived around N pm . checked in and waited for our luggage . . . finally went down and got it ourselves . the room was a little grungy , furniture shabby , and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover . ewww . called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me . fyi it ' s kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel . next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didn ' t work . called for a replacement , waited a while , called again and was brought another iron which also didn ' t work . third time was a charm . oh boy . too bad we paid in advance . won ' t be staying here again . 
do not stay at this hotel ! a friend and i booked a N-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in chicago . though it was a bit pricy , we decided on the knickerbocker because it was in a great location , and the rooms looked large and well-kept . our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time . however , despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay , when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an hour until we were allowed up to our room . the concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us , and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late . to top it off , the maid service was terrible . the only thing they seemed to do was make the bed no vacuuming , no fresh towels , etc . we didn ' t want to stay the third night , but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee . this hotel is way too much money for the services they provide , you ' d be better off staying in a motel N . 
no excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner . i wouldn ' t expect a cold shower at a budget hotel , let alone an omni . great location and the bar is nice . 
i was very unsatisfied with my stay at the allegro . the front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window . after giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet . this came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began . after waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested . we were informed that they were ' only requests ' and not a guarantee . room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed . when we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted . the food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasn ' t exactly right either . this is not the kind of service i expected from an upscale hotel . 
great location - right on the chicago river - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size , very clean and with a nice river view - overall , a great staff - in particular i would like to point out christy morgan - chief experience officer and paula fortney - concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one - ( in the interests of full disclosure , we stayed here on our amex - starwood points ) 
homewood suites is a hilton group hotel located in downtown chicago . though close to many sights , when we visited there was extensive construction going on along michigan avenue , so every morning we were awakened right at N am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers . we reserved the basic suite . though we arrived at N pm , well past check-in time , our room was not ready for N minutes . the management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience . once the suite was ready , it was nice . but then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom . we were relocated to another room with apologies , but again , no offer of compensation for the trouble . once we were finally settled , the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer . the food was okay , but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point . the staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service . we though it was a good idea since we were already so tired . unfortunately , it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected . all in all we were disappointed with our experience at homewood suites . we understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable . i would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting chicago . 
my husband and i stayed here for new years eve weekend . this is an excellent hotel in an excellent location . hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming . the rooms had the best electronics i ' ve ever seen . loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall . the hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by , so we avoided it too . ate at joe ' s across the street - excellent seafood . and you can shop til you drop without going outside ! nordstroms and four story mall is attached . lots of good ' food on the run ' places in there . loved chicago - loved the conrad . i will go back ! 
this is a tough one to review . . . as the star ratings were from N star to N and had to figure out an average . . . . N is where it was . here are my tips and props complaints room N star . i had a corner suite . the room was pretty nasty actually ( N . . stay away from it ! ! ! ) . there was a constant banging noise from above . when i first got in i thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding . after an hour , i knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong . well , the sound continued on for N days . not that i minded too much as i keep things on for white noise . . . but it sure would bug others . also , there were about N cig burns on the carpet and sofa . in addition , it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa . also , there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat . i could not imagine all the dna left on that thing either . gags bathroom nice size but not great . the faucet was lose ( really lose ) and the toilet would not flush right . service great . everyone i encountered did a great job making me feel welcome . good stuff . food i had meetings there , so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made . it was really good . . . much better than most hotels . bar very cool . good music , great service and good drinks . the scene was decent as well . small bar , but was not cramped . so , maybe other rooms are nicer . . . well hell they better be . regardless , if one room is like that ( especially a ' suite ' ) , i have to think others are like that as well . it is too bad though . the views are great and they actually have windows that open . . . big shocker for the city in general ! 
i have heard friends talking about the hotel monaco in chicago and did have my doubts at first . however when i arrived there was amazed at the location ! it is near so many shopping places , museums , theatre , and many others places . was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long , however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire N day stay . fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day ! the staff at the place is amazing i even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people . one day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best i have ever had at a hotel . all and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room , good service , and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby , will be heading back to this hotel many times . 
the omni chicago hotel was a delight to stay in . the second you step into the place , it takes your breath away . it ' s very modern with an antique twist . the rooms are spacious and comfortable . they are clean . every member of the staff was courteous and polite . proud of their place of work . happy to be there . you don ' t often see that . the room service was phenomenal . visiting chicago was amazing , and staying at the omni hotel made my visit that much better . the luxurious pools were an added plus as well . i also enjoyed the gym facilities . i will definitely be staying at the omni hotel on my next visit . 
staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute , budget valentines weekend trip for my husband and me . we got a great rate -- N -- on priceline . close to the subway ( red line ) and we got from o ' hare to the hotel in less than an hour for N . N for both of us . we were able to check in more than N hours early . room was great -- very clean , good closet space and fantastic bedding . had one expensive drink at the irish bar , but the bartender ' s advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price . concierge was helpful , too . overall , service was terrific , room was great and staying there was a treat . i would stay there again any time , especially at that price . 
the hotel is almost always very helpful . this stay caused me to re-think if i like the palmer house . i had dirty covers for the bed . it was also the smallest room in the hotel i am sure . my husband and i usually come N times each year . he is there doing business and cta work . we are not pleased with the size of the room at all now . rooms have always had two chairs , desk , and usually N by N feet . not this room on the Nth floor . it was only N x N approx . the service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time . in the past we had a bell man steal a N . pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially . 
we just arrived from a N nights stay at the sofitel chicago water tower . it was faboulous . fine linen , nice room with bigs windows , bathroom with a shower , flat tv . check for the deals on the sofitel website , we had N nights for the price of two ! 
i stayed at swissotel chicago for N night while on vacation with my girlfriend . our plan was to stay N nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate . we walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in , we still stood waiting for N minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel . once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention , she got off the phone and acted like i was the one at fault . needless to say i will not be staying here again . 
the omni was chosen for it ' s location whichworked out perfectly . the bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean . . . until . . . i sat down in the tub . . . there was black mold in the soap holder , in the cracks on the walls between the tile , all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl . needless to say i drained the tub and took a shower . . . i really don ' t care for showers . oh yes . . . the toilet leaked as well . . . the staff were very helpful but i was disappointed . i travel extensively and don ' t think i will return . we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken , so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel , printed the presentation and delivered it to our room . they try ! we booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the Nth floor with a view of the windows of another building . . . but we weren ' t there too much . 
we live down the block from the hotel . we arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away . the floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night . i think the ambassador east was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . over the years i had had some visiting groups stay there . i had also eaten there and been to the bar but i had never stayed there myself . the lobby is elegant . the service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . the location is the best residential area in the city ( as far as i am concerned -- i live two blocks away ) and it is very convenient to north michigan avenue ( a good shopping street ) and reasonably convenient to the loop ( the main business area ) there are also probably N restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . i paid less than N including tax for one night . i am not sure what their regular rates are but i think my deal was the best travel bargain around . 
was slated for two nights in chicago , june N - N , N . i could onyl get the intercon for both nights . i booked a handicapped room since that was they had left . after reading other reviews of the property , i decided to move it from two nights to one , and stay the second night at the hotel monaco . of course , upon check-in , i was given a suite . nice room , great linens , clean bathroom , and very quiet . parking is really high ( N ) . i understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated , but everything was clean and worked well . at , ost , the rooms were a bit dark . i had a late night drink at the bar , which was reasonably priced . i did not eat there , but the menu seemed pretty good , albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected . in all , i thought the place was everything i needed , and was very happy with the room , the staff , the linens , and the housekeeping . much better than others have indicated . 
swisses chicago nice , but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the chicago waterfront . a spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city , but don ' t plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning . no free wifi here , or affordable breakfast , or a free swim in the pool . just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet , an on average N plate for breakfast , and another N bucks a night for the ' fitness center . ' i ' ve stayed in small town no star motels where wifi is free as part of a N dollar room . get with it - this is N ! no free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don ' t need it anyway , but for those of us who aren ' t charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated . coffee , milk , oj stale donuts , , muffins , maybe some cereal . throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby . with regards to swimming , this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till N pm plan accordingly . this all makes the N fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain . summation drop the fees , the nickel dimming of folks , and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel . 
the intercontinental chicago is conveniently located near midway airport so the commute was short and easy . the room had a great view of a lake . room service was available N hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great i did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee . there was a business center that had internet , fax machines , and copy machines that was available for use N hours a day . one of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs , it was exactly what i needed , very relaxing . the food at the eno was some of the best i ever ate especially the chocolate , i never wanted to leave . this was a great hotel experience and i would stay there again . 
stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for N nights in early april N . very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the golden mile . good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice french twist . dinner at the restaurant was also good . prices are reasonable . room is comfortable , only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening . excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff . would definitely stay here again if visiting chicago . concierge recommended a small van tour , which was excellent . however early april is too early to visit chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of chicago was not operating yet . 
other reviews complain about the small rooms . for a major city , we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings . one feature we liked is the ability to open the window . the knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off michigan avenue in the best area of chicago . the staff was friendly and helpful . for the N we paid on hotwire , we could not have found a better room in downtown chicago . 
beautiful hotel , but doesn ' t have a lot to offer for the price . sheets and pillowcases in the room had stains on them , tv remote would not function properly . valet service truly needs improvement . we payed quite a bit for overnight parking , and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave . when we asked to find out what was taking so long , we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk , with no answers . 
the hard rock hotel in chicago has it all location , comfort , and rockability ! we stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago recently and found it to be amazing ! the location was perfect as it is walking distance to the magnificent mile , navy pier , and lake michigan . it was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums , shedd aquarium or the museum of science and industry ! the food , although it was pricey , was great ! there is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin ' , and if you have pets , they get the royal treatment , complete with gifts ! i would highly recommend the hard rock hotel of chicago ! 
the james hotel met and exceeded our expectations . a haven of cool , uncluttered comfort in a hot , crowded but congenial city . located within steps of some of the greatest art , architecture , culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in north america , the staff of the james provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited . the check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm , restorative oasis . it is difficult to over-praise the friendly , attentive staff this is a hotel that truly has its act together ! the day before our visit ended , we experienced problems with the room ' s air conditioner . when the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem , we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the chicago skyline . we eagerly await the opening of new james hotels in other cities . 
i unfortunately stayed for N nights at the knickerbocker hotel . . . i should have checked out on day N . the bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawling . . . i pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheets . . . bed bugs ! which i might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there ( fortunately i took photos to the contrary ) finding the bed bugs . . . i looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on both . . . i was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment . 
during my recent stay at the hyatt regency chicago , i was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff . to start off , the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms . hoping to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings , i had hoped to spend a quiet night in . my neighbors , however , watching what i can only imagine was a real house wives of new jersey marathon on full volume , destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance . when i asked the concierge to address the issue , he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job . as i visited the gym , i found their ' state-of-the-art ' stayfittm gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills , weights and yoga mats . the water in the cooler was quite warm , and the workout towels were stained and tattered . finally , all the hypo-allergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds . 
this is best hotel bargin in chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room . great hotel just redone by kimpton . this is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels . this is a location just off of lasalle and next to the cadillac theater . it has a N star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing italian meal . the wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants . the kimptons have a social hour N to N with wine at all of their hotels . you sit in a designer , kind of london circa N couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests . they are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it . the exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well . there are two other kimptons here but for the money the allegro is the best value and location . always consider kimptons as they never disappoint where ever we have used them . 
i recently returned from a trip to chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby . while the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers . when we arrived it took over an hour to check in . we had requested two rooms on the same floor , which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival . when we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it . eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there . we also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate N adults and two babies in strollers . when we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for N adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in . we also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping . we filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests . after complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate . this ' something ' never arrived . we will not be making a return visit to this hotel . while the housekeeping staff , location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative . 
my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel last month for my son ' s wedding . when we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to valet our car . after waiting N minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip , which i found rude . after finally getting to our room i noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom . i was extremely disappointed with the room and the service . i will not recommend this place to anyone . 
we booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown . we where woken up at N N in the morning with our bathroom flooded , this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet . we where moved to another room , but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for . the next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets , coffee or towels , which is just horrible service . the service along with the orginal room where perfect , but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel . 
i would not reccomend staying at the hard rock hotel chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep . i stayed at the hard rock hotel chicago for two nights this past july . i had a select king city view room . the room was dark , with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view . i was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow . the hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long , so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there . when i called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did . i ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door . they quieted down for about an hour , but then were loud again for the rest of the night . the hotel was expensive , and for the price there weren ' t very many special amenities . there was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at N a day . overall i would not recommend staying at the hard rock hotel chicago , as it is way overpriced for what you get . 
i would like to add a comment , maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination . my daughter was married in may of N and we decided to have the special event at the sofitel water tower we were amazed . she always wanted a ballroom type of wedding , and sofitel made this happen for her . they took care of all the invitations , cake decor , and so much more . the special day for my daughter was worth everything . if you are going to be in the chicago area , check them out you will not regret it ! 
i booked two rooms four months in advance at the talbott . we were placed on the top floor next to the elevators , which are used all night long . when speaking to the front desk , i was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor , which i had requested for a better view . i am looking at a brick wall , and getting no sleep . he also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the Nth floor , and were aware of the noise problem . why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked ? a request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the top floor and using that request to justify this . if you decide to stay here , request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator ! i spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences . this is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain . 
great hotel ! the staff is friendly , corteous , and professional . they made me feel like i was a returning guest which i was not ( but i will be ! ) . the rooms were very clean and i slept well in the comfy bed . they have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that i took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside . my only issue was the battery for the tv remote died . however , a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about N minutes ! N stars ! ! ! 
the ambassador east hotel hello my current visit to the ambassador east hotel . i really enjoy my N day weekend stay at this hotel . this was my first time at the hotel and i reserved a king size suite . inside my room there was nice view of chicago ' s gold coast . i really needed to get some work done for my business trip and this room was perfect for the situation . i could easily relax on my king size bed . i watch hbo on a enormous size flat screen tv for free . also when i did do my work there was nice wooden desk in my room with a desk lamp and wifi modem . it so nice to have my laptop with me and able to use it on a good workstation in my room . after finishing my work i have time to check the complimentary fitness room . lastly i left the next day , i had one of the finest breakfast dishes from their pump room restaurant . overall the ambassador east hotel is a N out N hotel and really worth the stay . 
i had purchased this deal of off groupon . lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures . when we layed down to sleep in our bed . we lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed ( attached in photos ) , we immediatly called the front desk . the only thing they offered was a new set of sheets . when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quickly hid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again . we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean . then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos , and they offered me a ( N ) refund . i was very dissapointed , and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and i broke out on my face with acne ( i never had a acne or skin issues ) im positive something in those dirtyy sheets . we drove N . N hours to enjoy chicago and we stayed the hard rock based on reputatuion , and unfortunitly we were very disspointed . it was disgusting ! i then wrote a email to management and heard nothing back . not even a response or apology . i just really expected alot more . 
my family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early august . we were promised a room with two double beds . when we arrived ( earlier than most ) we were told they were N double beds short . we reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed . we had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a N year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away . little did we know we were being charged a daily fee for this bed . the managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel . the bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night . the managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating . we were so disappointed in this hotel . also , they do not have a pool here . if you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay N a day to use it . N for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous . do yourself a favor , if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise , go elsewhere . chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one . i never heard back from managment on this issue when i called and emailed so obviously they don ' t care , even when i told them i ' d write a review on this website . chicago is an awesome city though . we loved it ! 
i took the wife and kids to chicago for one last fling before school started back up . when i checked in , the staff was very attentive , i showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude ( small tip ) and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar ! i didn ' t get the ' priceline ' glare and it paid off for all involved . the air and water show was underway on the lake front , and we had planes flying over our room . the kids thought it was great . that night we had a great view of the fireworks at navy pier . the sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason . the conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly . it was one of the best times we ever had in chicago . 
we loved the talbott . the location was fabulous . . . very close to the shopping . the hotel is smaller , but the rooms are very nice . they are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well . also , the beds are some of the most comfortable i have ever slept in . i might also add that our room at queen beds . the staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you . the hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers , etc . it looks like a scene out of europe . i would highly recommend the hotel . we were there with our daughters ages N and N . 
my fiancee and i were looking for a modern , upscale venue for our wedding reception . we have found the perfect location at the james . from the ballroom to the personal attention to detail , each step was handled with care . now that we have locked in our date , we are more excited than ever . thank you staff at the james for making our day even more special ! 
while the james was once considered an elegant , chic establishment , it has lost its luster . the small rooms are filled with cheap ikea type furnishings , our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain . showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing . the N small elevators could not handle the guests , and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time . the thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night . it was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing , but also rather tacky unsettling . it took more then N minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out . this hotel has lost it and the james sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in new york ' s soho when they try to open in september . new yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence . 
if you ' re in chicago and want to stay in the loop , the allegro hotel is perfect for you . it ' s centrally located , stylish rooms and attentive staff . i stayed at the hotel for N nights and was very pleased with everything . the bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows , large flat screen tv , radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean . everyone that i came in contact with was very friendly and helpful . my last day there , i ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time , the kitchen called to see if everything was alright . i have never had that kind of follow up service . i ' ve stayed at the palomar in dc , another kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too . i will definitely see if kimpton has a hotel at my next destination . 
after considering several hotels in the area , my family and i finally decided , unfortunately , on homewood suites , for our long weekend vacation . overall , the experience left much to be desired . the breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries . the linens on one of our beds seemed dirty , and when i told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced , the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude . i would not come back here ever . 
i can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover . N . there was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor . i kid you not . how can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm ? N . the furniture was severely chipped . ok . i dont mind chipped furniture if i am slumming it in my just-out-of-college-sister ' s apartment . but for N a night , i want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive N . the receptionist while i was checking in was super curt . i know it was late but isnt that sort of your job ? not everything was horribly bad though . the one star is for the bathroom that was super clean . i do not recommend this place at all . 
this hotel is great ! i love its interior design of the room . customer service is excellent ! and its gym and spa are gorgeous . if you need to go to chicago , this hotel would be your best choice ! you can also check its website for the special offer , i found a great deal on it ! 
just spent three nights at the amalfi hotel , while in chicago on business . booked a king-corner room and loved it . largest room i ' ve ever had in a hotel in chicago , incredibly comfortable , very clean . the breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too . and the location couldn ' t be beat . walking distance to the the river , the loop , michigan ave shopping and convenient to public transportation . i noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise yes there is some street noise , and the building across the street is under construction ( the noise from that was usually between N-N , if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side ) but really , in downtown chicago it ' s not going to be silent , if you want silence stay in the suburbs . if you want a great hotel ( at a great price ) right in the thick of everything , stay at the amalfi . 
my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york . the room was very spacious and clean , the bed was huge and extremely comfortable . i really liked the aveda bathroom products , great smell . we had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot . compliments to the chef . the concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to navy pier , directions were given to us accompanied by a map . the weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show , this was spectacular . the whole of the last day of the show we spent at navy pier and the millenium park . location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping . if we are ever in chicago again we will definately stay here . 
we traveled to chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city . to our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations . gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one . . . elevator that is working to the second floor to register . our first room was recently renovated . . . . . stark white walls , no amenities at all . guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room . modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud , a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair . no fride , coffee maker , iron , or even a picture on the stark white walls . we asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the Nth floor . while this room was attractive , we were greeted to jack hammers at N every morning . the staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking . lake shore drive 
i walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that i would have a wonderful stay in chicago . after walking around the city all day , i was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place . the service was friendly and i especially liked the location . what a treat ! 
first let me say , the front office people at hotel monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what i ' d hoped . there are some other problems the furnishings are quite rundown , and housekeeping wasn ' t very helpful . we booked a suite and the sofa bed , chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use . i ' ve attached pictures , so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows . comfortable it was not ! the chair bottom is all broken down too . i invited one of the assistant managers to view our furniture , and a slight adjustment was made in our rate . as to housekeeping , we had ordered an in-room coffee service ( which kimpton ' s web site says is there , but you have to specifically request ) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee . we had to call the front desk every day . and , housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl . i had requested water be added to the bowl when i noticed it going down and my note was disregarded . these things may not matter to you , but if you plan to spend a week , like we did , you might want to be comfortable . the bedroom and bathroom were superior just the living room was bad . 
will not stay here again . we were here pre-construction so didn ' t have the noise problems that others are now experiencing . but room and service quality were so poor that we will not return . our suite was large enough , but it was dirty , dated and worn . the bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly . public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days , disgusting . we ( politely ) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed . we had paid for the king tut package , which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit . they had no record of this and didn ' t honor it . of course , the exhibit was sold out , so our main reason for visiting chicago was ruined as we weren ' t able to see this part of the field museum . my ( also polite ) letter to hilton and the manager was never acknowledged . very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding hilton in general when possible . 
i have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood , cost and amenities . the hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open , you wouldn ' t know it . you need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock . the beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a ' nicer historic hotel . ' i will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime . it was a very frustrating experience . 
i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning . the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me . the room wasnt at all what i was expecting . it was dingy , dirty , and just seems like an old hotel . just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel . seemed like the quality you ' d expect from a cheap motel . 
having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website , i arrived tired from ireland , to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night , but did have rooms for the rest of the week . they booked me in to another ( not as nice ) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation . on my return to the hotel next day , i was upgraded to the club level . what really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake . . . unprompted . of course , the hotel itself ( particularly on the Nnd floor ) is excellent . i will definitely be back . 
if you have the money , amalfi hotel is the place for you . all the way from it ' s N thread count , egyptian linens to the N hour fitness center . this hotel has anything you would need or want . the rooms are equipped with free wi-fi , Nin plasma televisions , multi-head showers and much , much more . you can do anything from fine dining and wine to working on the computers in the business center , which is equipped with computers free to your use . after a long night at the bar , you can get a complimentary breakfast at each floor . over all the service is great as well . i recommend this hotel to any one from business professionals to young singles looking for a good time . i plan on coming back very soon . 
don ' t ever stay at this hotel ! , conrad chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine . first of all , the price ! you not get what you pay for . i paid N . N one night for a room that did not even had a tv ! ! that ' s ridiculous ! the bathroom did not work , and it was nasty ! the bed sheets seemed like used , as if some people slept there and they smelled bad ! after my experience with conrad chicago , i will please ask you to reconsider getting a room in this hotel . you get better service and accommodations even in a N star motel ! 
i received the type of room that i had reserved . cleanliness seems to be an issue with the maid staff . the carpet had debris and the bathroom needed attention . room service was adequate but not great . the walls seem to be paper then as i heard one neighbor ' s tv for most of the night and the other neighbor ' s late enjoyment . 
my wife and i stayed here in the middle of february N . we took the ( el ) subway to the hotel from o ' hare . it was very convenient . the lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable . i ' ve stayed in many a hotel room , this bed was the most comfortable i ' ve ever slept in . the hotel is located in a great area and close to everything . walking distance to almost all the interesting sites chicago has . would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city . 
my daughter wanted to spend the weekend in chicago for her Nst birthday recently , and i wanted to find the best hotel for her experience . i looked at the hotel website and really like hotel allegro ' s insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services , so i booked us for a friday and saturday night . upon arriving , the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant . not enough to warrant a verbal complaint , but enough to make my daughter and i feel uneasy . after check-in , which took at least N minutes due to severe under-staffing , we headed to our room trying to be optimistic . our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested , the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound , and we only had a stock of N towels , which were never replaced during our stay . we made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel . it was a huge disappointment , for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl . i highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel . there are much better choices in the chicago area . 
wow ! i have been to many hotels as a business man , and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels . but wow , this hotel was great . the staff was prompt , the room was extremely clean , and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine . i was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things . usually i have to pay N for a stupid toothbrush , but not here ! i really enjoyed staying at intercontintental . i was very worried about the chicago area ' s reputation of bad hotels , but this turned out just great . next time my boss flies me out to chicago , i know where i am staying ! 
i stayed here with a dozen of my friends , and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs ! we stayed there from september N - september Nth , but the symptoms ( i . e . the crazy itchiness ) didn ' t come until sunday night when we all got home . i complained to the hotel and basically all they ' re gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills . honestly , they should reimburse us , because it was not worth it at all . do not stay at this hotel ! ! ! 
i stayed at the affina chicago for my anniversary . the hotel is in a great location , but that doesn ' t make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff . it looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet . i spent more money than i would normally , hoping for a luxury experience , and left very unsatisfied . 
i was in town to visit my cousin an stayed for three nights at this wonderful hotel . its so close to the shopping i wanted to do with my cousin , granted i had a personal guide a . k . a . my cousin janice . the amenities were unbelieveable an the service was great with the upmost hospitality . would recomend to everyone great for kids an adults . the room and view were spectacular , the beds were very comfy and the room was emaculate . 
this hotel does not live up to the reviews . the room was larger than i expected . however , the decor was a bit dated . the bedding was ripped , carpet was stained , and the shower door was broken . there was a long wait to the elevators , and if you ' re on floors N-N you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym . the main issue i had was the attitude i received from the staff . there was literally only one nice person at the front desk . there are no ice machines in this building , so you have to request it from the front desk . one day i requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person . N minutes later i made a follow up call because i did not receive my ice . i was nastily told that ice takes N minutes and i should just wait . i finally got the ice N minutes later . two days later i requested ice again . waited N minutes and just gave up . while i was leaving , i mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said ' i didn ' t get a call for ice . ' well i obviously wasn ' t making it up , lady ! i called and spoke with someone . she didn ' t even apologize or offer me anything . overall , i would not recommend this hotel . there are so many hotels in the chicago area . choose a different one . 
my stay at sheraton chicago hotel and towers was wonderful , i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good , i was able to get to my meeting well rested , thank you sheraton ! -bobby 
this hotel is fantastic . i stayed there on my way through chicago towards arizona , and could not believe the great quality of the hotel . i ' d have thought i was in a vegas suite . really polite staff , great housekeeping , and amazing prices . on my way out , i was telling the manager about how much i ' d loved the hotel , and he even offered me an extra night there ! you can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly N hours . 
the sofitel chicago water tower was horrible . the first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was ok to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didn ' t even have a record of our reservation . after much inappropriate arguing , they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine . when we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or tv . it took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably . the next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in . a quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount . we finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel , the fancypants hotel and suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club . overall , the service at the sofitel was rude , rooms were unsatisfactory , restaurant sub-par , not well kept up or clean . in the future i would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record , like the fancypants hotel and suits , my personal favorite . 
i was sorely disappointed with the sheraton chicago . from the outside it looks like a great hotel , and i guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy , not what i expected when looked at the website . the front desk staff was nice enough at first , but when i asked for the wifi password they told me i had to pay extra . i mean come on , i ' m paying over N bucks a night and wifi is extra ? the lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation . ( note to self , don ' t let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd . ) so things started off on the wrong foot anyhow . i guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview ( from some of the rooms ) and it seems pretty safe . other than that i was not impressed for the price - i ' ve stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens , a better restaurant , where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour ( we stayed two nights and we didn ' t get our beds made and fresh towels until almost N ) . i guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell . in general it seems lke it ' s on the decline and the staff knows it , they ' re just kind of lackadaisical . i wouldn ' t stay there again . 
the allegro in downtown chicago is a great stay part of the kimpton group boutique hotels the allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city . i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the ' el ' into the loop which leaves you about N minutes from the hotel otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors , comfortable beds and in my case great views . if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days kimpton does a great job and their properties are ' class acts ' 
i ' m a frequent business traveler and often in chicago on trips . at times , it ' s very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown chicago , and this was one of those times . i recently had to pay almost N for one night at the allegro . it was absolutely not worth it . the hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers , so check-in and check-out were very slow . there were very few elevators , which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests . the morning i checked out , our elevator stopped at every single floor from the Nth floor down to the lobby , but the elevator was almost completely full when i got on at the Nth floor , so i can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs . the room was extremely small and cramped , even though it had obviously been renovated recently . the tv , bed , and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel . still , the rate was way overpriced for such a small room . the best thing about the allegro was the room service , which was prompt . the food was good , and the prices were very reasonable for room service . from now on , if my regular hotels are booked , i ' ll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn ' t worth it . 
named my price on priceline . N . N bucks . hotel room was great . clean , clean and new . fresh crisp sheets , comfortable bed , flat screen tv , clean carpet , nice bath , etc . short distance to food and sightseeing . i highly recommend this property . be prepared to pay over N . N per night to park . hey , its a hyatt . they also charge N . N for a bottle of water that is normally a buck . for a total of N . N nightly stay in chicago this place is it just don ' t drink the bottled water . happy travels 
avoid the talbot , especially for group functions . my in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests . they were lured in by promises from the talbot , that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide ' special , personal treatment ' . nothing could have been further from the truth . they failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception , they persistently confused reservation requests , they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests , his wife , and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight . now the worse part . mistakes are made , even hotel managers are human , but where a hotel , which is supposed to be in the hospitality service , can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error . case in point i had requested on several occasions when i made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card , all expenses , they assurred me that this would be no problem . of course , when my brother , his wife , and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn ' t let them check in until they physically saw my card . . . again despite them having my card on record , and despite my explaining this to them over the phone . my brother recalls the ' indignation ' of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card . then another guest , in this case my older brother , came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby . when i finally was able to get across town , leaving a cubs game early , i again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account . again they agreed , but never did anything about it . in the end when my older brother checked out on sunday he was told everything was alright , but when he went to his atm his account was frozen from ' unathorized overuse ' . the hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained . when he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events . i spent sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on monday , the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone , calling the talbot , the credit card fraud division , my brother , etc trying to solve this situation . the most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager , who at one point suggested that ' i was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters ' . . . . this was a witnessed event , and her insinuation was that i was lying , and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake . in the end , there is no one running this place . . . managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail . when i was finally able to get the name of the general manager ( after two days ) m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back . the communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant . fortuneatly the staff at the signature room ( where we had the reception ) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost , but the the talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests . try the ambassador east ( same neighborhood ) cheaper , much more professional staff . 
the heating in our room didn ' t work and wasn ' t repaired depite numerous requests , the rooms were very small , the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay , the cleaner made the bed but nothing else , when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the N night stay despite my having pre-paid through a travel agent , it took the hotel N months to re-credit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous trans-atlantic phone calls to them . 
after staying at the james chicago last weekend i can honestly say i will be going for affordability on my next trip . the james chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected . the chairs in the room looked like something out of ikea . i love chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay . i believe i would have been better off and happier staying at the holiday inn . you don ' t always get what you pay for . 
beautiful hotel in chicago . i visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife . they are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services . i would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago . 
this hotel was an absolute dream to stay in . i couldn ' t have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury . i enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered . the room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well . i honestly felt like i was at a spa ! the price was very reasonable as well . i would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone i know . if you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms ! ! ! 
overall i had a very bad experience when hosting a meeting for company , but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the swissotel , i thought we should give them another try . turns out my first impression was correct , this is the least friendly hotel i ' ve ever been in ! even the concierge was rude and disagreeable . i could go on and on , but instead i ' ll just say go somewhere else ! 
staying at the hard rock hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling . i stayed at this one the last time i visited chicago and it was just wonderful . the rooms are amazing and the one i stayed in had a great view of the city . the beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat , the wi-fi was really fast and always available and i liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones . i didn ' t have the chance to use the spa , but i could tell it was really nice and relaxing . i did go to the base bar a couple times for a drink , very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from . the rock shop was pretty cool too and i bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends . overall i think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in , the experience is definitely different than any other hotel i ' ve stayed in . 
having stayed at the excellent affinia chain in ny , i had very high expectations . when i saw the trip advisor rating , i immediately booked . what a huge disappointment -- the quality simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap , foam pillows -- the kind they sell in the store for N . you cannot sleep on these -- the windows are so thin , you can hear the buzzing from walk don ' t walk sign on superior below . -- the walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked , i was awaken around midnight , my room engulfed in smoke odor . a call downstairs yielded no results -- there are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood the desk chair was full of loose threads -- the water flow is very weak , but the towels are nice -- there are unpainted floorboards , the kind you find in day ' s inn -- they charge for internet service the tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like . the sign outside is also a banner . having stayed all over the u . s . , you are better off at red roof -- this is really an embarassment for the affinia chain . wait until they complete the renovations in N . i did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand . good heart , but the problems are not fixable . 
the millennium hotel knickerbocker sounds fine , and the website is pretty , but the reality is an over-hyped , overpriced , reality-isn ' t-as-good-as-fantasy package . the catering they offer is a joke you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the chicago area . while the rooms were cleaner than most , there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses , and when i called to complain about it , a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off . the rooms look small but cozy when you book online , but when you get there in person , you realize just how tiny they are . trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did i mention that it smelled like cleaning solution ? i also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed , which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is . in fact , it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small you ' d get better prices and a far better room from the hilton . 
this hotel is absolutely beautiful . i is elegant , comfortable and a very relaxing stay . it was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping . i felt like a king in a castle surrounded by luxury and beauty . i would recommend this hotel to anyone . 
i recently traveled up to chicago for business and had a terrific N day N night stay at the sofitel chicago water tower in downtown . the location was perfect as it gave me easy access to michigan avenue and the conference center where i was doing business . my hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere . i ordered room service for dinner and it came within N minutes so i was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs . the food was extremely good and i really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat . i had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress . i woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel . they had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well . after shower i headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests . the breakfast was delicious and started my day out right . after my business stuff was over i really got out and enjoyed chicago . i met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well . when i go back to chicago i will definitely stay at the sofitel again . 
the affinia in chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences . if you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for affinia , do not expect any measure of customer service and don ' t expect great accommodations , even at their high prices . when we arrived our reservation was lost , then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available . the furnishings in the room were cheaply made , the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel ' s l shaped corridor . i called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time . two hours later someone came . the dining hall and reception areas were really nice , but again , unless you ' re a large group don ' t expect to enjoy them during your stay at affinia . even if you could , the prices wouldn ' t be worth it . 
my family and i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers with the belief our stay would be a N star experience . that was the farthest thing from the truth . the staff was very rude and unhelpful . the hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff . once we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over . so overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room . as we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest . my wife went to the bathroom , and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor . that was just the beginning of our bad stay . after being in the room for about N minutes , there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the chicago police . there was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room ! my family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched . there was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched . come to find out after video surveillance , the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana . needless to say , our stay at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers was the worst part of our vacation and i would not recommend anyone to stay at this place . 
my stay at the james hotel in chicago was fantastic ! the hotel was clean , modern and everything i had hoped for . the staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations . all of our needs were more than met and i will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates . 
my expectations were not high because i booked this hotel through priceline for N night . an amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait N - N minutes for hot water . i called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied ' try running it for N to N minutes . ' they forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower , if anyone else expected to use the shower . my boyfriend , who showered after me , had to wait another N minutes to get the shower warm again . to make matters worse , after room service was delivered , we called and said we needed another fork . they told us it would cost N ( N for the fork , N for delivey charge ) . absolutely ridiculous ! ! at least with a N star hotel , you get hot water . this is supposed to be a N star hotel . i guess you do get what you paid for - i just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price . 
we chose to stay at the hilton chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close ! what i didn ' t expect was for the beds to be so comfortable . i can ' t remember when i got a better night ' s sleep . the staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept . we ' ll be returning to the hilton chicago the next time we ' re in town ! 
stayed at the intercontinental for an entire week on business and for the most part a very elegant , convenient visit . stayed in the historic tower . very nice rooms , great view , attentive staff , convenient location just north of the tribune tower the river , and nice fitness club at N for the entire stay . the only downside is i couldn ' t get over the feeling that i was being nickle dimed N a day for wi-fi , N bottles of water in the room , N mini-bottle of wine in the fridge , tipping multiple staff for carrying the same bags , etc . their in-house restaurant zest is zagat rated though i ' m not sure why . within a N minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than zest . but , next time i need to be near the loop i ' d stay at the intercontinental again . 
i stayed here for N nights last summer . i booked the reservation on priceline for N night which was the cheapest rate i could find anywhere during a convention week . anyway , when i arrived at N pm from the airport , i was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me . they booked me at a dumpy N star motel by the airport . they gave me N for a taxi to get there , and it cost me N . i was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packing unpacking . the millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foul-up . no free drink , no room upgrade , nothing . since i booked on the internet , i was chopped liver . beware . 
my wife and i stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it . the atmosphere was very chic upscale in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank . my wife even got to bring along her dog ( aka N man ! ) . i would definitely stay here again would recommend it to anyone staying in the chicago area . 
i booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed . the room looked nice , but i found that there weren ' t any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional . i came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon . i asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming . i would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport , especially since the website advertises the close distance . instead , i had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic . all in all , not the best experience at all . 
we stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on trip advisor and yelp . we might have had a one in a million experience , but we - were served a hairy salad ( a long black hair held a lettuce leaf hostage ) - considered our guest room tiny - could not submerge a thigh , much less a body , in the tub ( we ' re not obese and we ' re not dexter ) - endured a broken air conditioner for days ( it couldn ' t be repaired ) - experienced the delight of an inexplicably broken toilet ( they fixed it that day ) . on a positive note , the tea from room service tasted delicious , employees were abundant and friendly , the location is great , and it ' s very easy to get a taxi . in the future , i would reluctantly stay here for business . i would not stay here for pleasure . i think a N-something who hasn ' t traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a seasoned traveler would . . . as a friend said to me today , ' oh , the sofitel ? that ' s the hilton of france . ' i agree . 
while i had stayed in the hotel monaco before , this was my husband ' s first trip to chicago and i insisted we stay here as i loved it the first time . well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . the warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . unfortunately we missed the wine hour . one thing that realy impressed me is that b c of flight delays we got to chicago a day late -- hotel monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation . 
i stayed at the hilton chicago because i was attending a conference at the hotel . the room was sufficient - had a coffee maker , bed , hangers , tv , etc . that ' s about where my compliments end restaurant rates are outrageous . N for a breakfast buffet ? N to use the gym ? N . N hr for wifi ! ? ! ? ! this is unacceptable when i ' m paying N per night . thank goodness the ice was free . servers in the restaurant and bar were surly , not well-versed in english , and just rude . computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night conference was incredibly cold . . . everybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time , despite our complaints to management . fridge in room was not usable . had to store cold items in the ice bucket . cable channels just flat out sucked . i was soooo bored when i had to spend an hour in my room . if i ' m paying that much , at least provide the full N channels . 
though grand and having a brand , this hotel seems to disappoint me on certain fronts . N . staff seemed snooty and arrogant . N . request for upgrade was fulfilled only after repetitive requests . the initial room was very small . N . for the cost paid i would expect a coffee maker , free internet service at the least which even regular b bs offer . N . they will levy charges on each and everything . complete rip off other things matched the grandeur . cleanliness and location was good , but the staff made my stay unpleasant . 
my visit to the conrad chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none . the lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style . the rooms are beautifully adorned . i especially like the flat screen tv and wired internet . i ' m never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast , reliable internet connectivity , and it ' s included at no additional charge . the view from the room was magnificent . . . downtown chicago at night ! the restaurant is spectacular but the terrace is the place to be when weather permits . you cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods . don ' t forget to visit the health and fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment . the staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need . just ask ! this is the place to stay in chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury ! 
the palmer house hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there ! i stayed at this hotel on business and all i can say is wow ! ! ! one of the main things that i liked about the hotel was the indoor pool ! i loved being able to go swimming even though it was december and N degrees outside ! also , the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings . i dined at lockwood restaurant and bar and the food was amazing for a hotel ! one thing that was a minor negative is that pets are allowed and my original room was next door to a barking dog , but the hotel staff was fantastic as switched up my room so i didn ' t have to deal with that ! all in all , this hotel was fantastic and i look forward to the next time i get to stay here ! 
i only stayed at this hotel for one night , the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy . after the first long wait i started to time how long it took from the moment i pushed the button until the elevator arrived , never under N min . even late at night . i went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband . . . N margarita was N ! i wans ' t drinking because i ' m pregnant so i had a soda water for N . . . if i would have known i would have had tap water . overall . . . great rooms , ok staff , horrible elevators , overpriced drinks . 
the affinia chicago is a wonderful place to stay , my husband and i stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time . the rooms were very well organized and comfortable , the staff there are very friendly , and the food there is more then amazing . we are defiantly going back next year . 
i was completely blown away by this hotel . it was magnificent . i got a great deal and i am so happy that i stayed here . before arriving i was nervous as i had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay , for example very noisy . however , whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant , it made no difference to me . my room was huge , bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure , bed was perfect and the view was amazing . hotel is so close to the great shops of magnificent mile , plus a comfortable walking distance to hancock tower and millennium park . 
my daughter and i woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . when we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . i then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . both were out of service ! ! ! ! i am glad there wasn ' t an emergency . as we were exited the pool area i ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean . . . . never heard back . 
booked via priceline . com for a weekend getaway and got the room for N per night . when we arrived via midway we took the orange line to within a block of the hotel for just N . hotel easy to find . never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood area . saw very few homeless or panhandlers . walked all over the place . great location and hotel is about a N- N cab ride from most major attractions shopping restaurants . hotel is almost gawdy with colors decor , but it ' s not that different from a cruise ship decor . it was not annoying decor by any means . check in was painless and the service was great ! heard no noise whatsoever . . . the reports of ' thin walls ' are greatly exaggerated . the walls are all concrete and thick . . . we heard nothing both nights we were there ! highly recommend this hotel ! rooms are small but not crowded for two people . . . they are old style hotel rooms . . very classic 
on my recent weekend stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel , i was very disappointed . i chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area . from the look of the website , my expectations were above average . i felt the website led one to believe it was upscale . upon my arrival , i checked in . i was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room . as i was settling into the room , i began to notice a general lack of cleanliness . i noticed spiderwebs in corners , and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom . also , it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room , however , it did not work and i had to call down for them to bring a replacement . i , as a guest should not have had to call down , these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in . i found the restaurants on site to be crowded , loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal . i did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items . overall , my experience was not good and the next time i am in the area , i will chose another hotel for my stay . 
what was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in chicago turned into a complete disaster . the first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of N was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in . . . they knew we had N ! we ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel . when we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on N different floors despite our request for rooms near each other . after some finagling they were finally able to get us in N rooms on the same floor , unfortunately one of the rooms hadn ' t even been cleaned which meant more waiting around . the staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating . on our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at N Nam . despite my calls to the front desk , the sound seemed to continue for about N minutes . we also didn ' t know the hotel was sooo pet friendly . one morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door . i understand they allow pets , but really . . . people need to clean up after their animals . . . or have some dog free floors . while hard rock hotel in chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms , their service was terrible , the staff was rude , and i still can ' t get over that dog poo in the hallway . i definitely won ' t be staying here again . 
after reading the trip advisor reviews , i was expecting an exceptional stay . i was not impressed overall . the concierge , the view , and the hotel resturant were the highlights . the bed , although not horrible , was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home , and i do not consider myself and extremely fussy person . i was traveling for business , and although not dressed in formalwear , was also not dressed down , but all in all , it felt a bit pretentious to me . there are better options for the money , and would gladly stay at the sutton place , sheraton towers , or trump for the similar price and better stay . i would ask trip advisor to move it down in the ratings . . . . . . not N in chicago , in my book . 
stayed at this hotel for labor day weekend and it was pretty awful . the staff were relatively friendly , but that ' s where the positive aspects stop . bed was rock hard and very uncomfortable . thermostat didn ' t work properly and the air conditioner was always N degrees warmer or colder than what you wanted . even though i think N for N day of internet is ridiculous , i bought it because i needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails . it was ungodly slow and barely better than dialup . i ended up finding a starbucks to use their wifi so i could actually get something done . minibar was overpriced , as expected . awful experience , definitely wouldn ' t stay here again . 
i took my family to the affinia chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous . my kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by . my wife was really stoked with spaffina . the pampering and really made her feel special . and they are very attentive to pets also . my dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention . the hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels , so their stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also . my favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content , which left me free to go over to underground wonderbar for a nice cocktail . 
my husband and me reserved a room online for the chicago hilton . we were looking for a quit few days away from home and work . unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for . first of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos . the floors looked like they haven ' t been cleaned in a while in the check in area . the room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side . the staff was horrible . we had asked for a turn down service it was never received . i would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone . chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the hilton . 
where do i start . the gm was a nice guy for handling the incident i had . anthony -the concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable . anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice . he set me up and quoted me a price of N , when i got to the spa ( which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon ) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was N with N off . at the end of the massage i gave the lady N and said thanks you can keep the change , she insisted that i got ' a hotel rate ' because anthony set me up . she called anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay anthony the difference - N . she then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which i declined . in short - shady dealings with this place . i was quite taken back . the gm selman comp ' d me a night but , i felt swindled big time . stay somewhere else . the concierge has something going on . . . 
i really had high hopes for homewood suites when i stayed there on a week-long business trip last month . after all , considering their prices ( it ' s technically a hilton ) , you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel . i ' ll start with the good stuff about the hotel it ' s in downtown . now for the bad stuff first , everyone is rude . i ' m not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp . the bellboy scowled at me in the lobby , was rough with my luggage , and then scowled at me again when i tipped him N . likewise , the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head . she had to call her supervisor over twice just to check me in , and i had a reservation ! apparently she was new , and didn ' t have much experience using the computer , but that ' s no excuse it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into N minutes of tedium . sadly , the room was no better than the service . the hot water in the sink did not work , the shower was only lukewarm , and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink . complimentary mood lighting , i guess . the tv was a bust sure it was an lcd , but the espn logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel . and to top it all off , the bed smelled funny . i called the front desk ( at least the phone worked ) , and asked for fresh sheets . the person i talked to said they ' d be right up , but never came . eventually , i gave up . i woke up the next morning to back pain ( the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow ) . i left the room , and made my way through the chilly hallways to the ' complimentary buffet . ' literally all the food was bad . even the cereal tasted stale . looking around , everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience . the sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel . just plain sad . worst part was , it was the same thing for the next four days , too . 
i just spent a week at the millennium knickerbocker hotel and it was a very plesant stay . when i first walked into the room it was very clean . the bathroom was a decent size and the decorum was pleasant . room service was very good . the view was amazing and i would recomend staying there . 
stayed here for N nights for a bridgestone firestone convention . no complaints . room was great with a beautiful view . staff was very accommodating . had drinks and appetizers in main bar . fantastic ! great location . yes it ' s a huge hotel as it ' s used for conventions but that didn ' t stop it from being a great place . 
my husband and i visited the fairmont chicago millennium park for our honeymoon . the customer service was amazing . from the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing . these people were proficient , respectful and very thoughtful . the fairmont had a lounge , a wine room , a bar and a restaurant . i couldn ' t decide where i wanted to go first ! after we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room . . . it was totally delicious . we also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon ! then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa , once again excellent ! ! everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time . we stayed in the gold room . although it was a little bit smaller than i thought it would be i was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows . my husband and i relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city . it was a wonderful experience that i will never forget . four thumbs up ! 
guys trip to chicago , scored this hotel on priceline for N a night . had a little confusion over the bed situation at first . they said they only had kings available even after i had called and requested N doubles . after a N minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with N doubles . the room was nice , nothing specacular , a little on the small side but nice . the lobby was beautiful to look at but that ' s about it . hotel is within walking distance to soldier field , sears tower , espn zone , and lots of bars and restaurants . great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip . would definately try and stay at this hotel again . 
overpriced is the best word to describe the conrad chicago hotel . while it may be in downtown chicago , the room had no view . although i asked for non-smoking , the room reeked of smoke . the elevators were very slow , and one was not working during my stay . there was a stain on the pillow , and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken . there was a dead bug in the bath tub . i was only given N towels for my N night stay . my credit card was billed twice , and it took N weeks to reverse to extra charge . i do not recommend this hotel at all ! 
i stayed at the sheraton as it was where a conference i was attending was being held . on the plus side , the hotel is reasonably well located , within a few minutes walk of michigan avenue . my room had a superb view out over the river . however , for the price i must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment . the decor was dated , and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty . the wifi is ridiculously expensive , and frustratingly as a conference delegate i was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for N hours access . there was no wifi in the conference rooms , although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails . i know chicago is expensive , but for that price i feel the experience should have been better . 
the hyatt regency hotel in chicago was the worst hotel i ever went to ! i booked a non-smoking room online , and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed . after going in my room , i smelled heavy smoke smell . it was really bad . i called the front desk about the issue , and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me ! there was also blood stains on my bed sheets . the carpet was also dirty . i would never book at that hyatt again ! 
i had the misfortune of being booked at the amalfi hotel in chicago a few weeks ago . what a joke . to start off , the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed . i don ' t know who made the bed up in my room , but it could have been done better by my N year old . ditto the bathroom . water spots , soap scum and ( ugh ) hair of all kinds in the sink , tub and about the floor . gross . i requested non-smoking , either they didn ' t listen or didn ' t care , but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray . the ' beautiful view ' was ruined by water spots - not outside ( which is forgiveable ) but inside ! and they were sticky . i stayed only one night . the holiday inn had rooms available , and they were clean . never again . 
the omni chicago hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel , particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv ' s . the windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room , before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows , which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom . an in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay . there ' s even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince . however , the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use , as well as the whirlpool , jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool . sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks . a nice aspect that isn ' t so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel . the omni chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation , particularly when you don ' t want to be separated from your pet , within the area . 
it has been a couple of years since i stayed here , and got it for a night last weekend on hotwire . i paid only N and stayed a saturday night . i was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel . the lobby has always been great , but the rooms were a little shabby in the past . not any more , as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years . the location is still amazing , and with the berghoff open again , there is a great restaurant within walking distance . 
i was very disappointed with this hotel . i have stayed in other swissotels and enjoyed them very much , but the service can only be described as aloof . there was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure , and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information i had given her minutes ago . precise , indeed . room service took forever to pick up ( good sign in a way busy because they are good ) , but the food arrived very late and very cold . the man tried to replace it , but than took another hour , and i was never given a price reduction , free dessert , or anything to apologize . as for cleanliness , they must be next to godly , as they knocked on my door at N , despite the fact i had a doorknocker requesting no service ( i ' m a late sleeper . ) very disappointed with my stay . this hotel clearly did not help build the chain ' s reputation . 
this is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities . everyone was helpful . the breakfast buffet was wonderful . the bed was ' just like home ' . we would definitely stay again . a nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home . it was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best . 
my friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in chicago . lets just say we were thankful we didn ' t have to spend much time in the room . the carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way . the furniture was worn and outdated . the place was gross and just wasn ' t worth the money we spent on it . the only redeeming quality was the door man , we was very nice and helpful . 
my recent stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park was everything i desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in chicago . i loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a N inch flat screen television and ipod docking station . i appreciated the walking distance to all of chicago ' s premiere shopping areas . the concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations , while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service . the services i received at at myspa were some of the best in the world . dinner at aria restaurant was delicious . in short , fairmont chicago millennium park was the perfect luxury vacation , meeting all my needs and more ! 
my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago this past summer . needless to say we will not be returning ! the hotel is very overpriced for what you get . upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had . the bed was very uncomfortable and the ' fully-stocked honor bar ' was stocked with only a few choices . the shower did not even work ! we booked the king suite with jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi . i would not recommend this place ! 
my sister and i went to chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because i have a friend who works at homewood suites here in cleveland so we got a discount . the valets were really friendly , you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel . check-in is on the Nth floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level . that also made finding the hotel tricky because i expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that i just had to pull over to the right side of the street . the lady at the front desk was friendly and informative . our room was very clean . the fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants , storing and reheating food . the complimentary breakfast was great ! they have real food such as eggs , bacon , french toast , cereal , bagels , juice , milk , and yogurt . the hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to navy pier and passes by michigan avenue . they also have free wifi . overall , i would definately stay here again and i would recommend it to others . 
i just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat ! the hotel website offers a great rate , and what i found was affordable luxury . i asked for a high floor found myself with a fabulous view , in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom , terrycloth robes and slippers , turndown service , roger gallet toiletries , a fluffy down conforter , and a wonderful pillowtop bed . the bathroom was so clean that it sparkled . the service was impeccable as well . even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants , brioches , pain au chocolat . the decor was unique the location convenient . check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby . this is a topnotch hotel . 
location , location , location . what a great find ! excellent , well-run , small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it . rooms are good-sized and clean good bed and shower with tub . the air conditioner , as mentioned in other reviews , is noisy , but it ' s a minor complaint . the staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge . the on site restaurant is great . the red-line el is about N-N blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze . you are footsteps away from rush street and north michigan avenue and lake michigan . i would not have a moment ' s hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future in fact , i wouldn ' t book anywhere else . 
the hilton in chicago was awesome . the room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional . one of the features i liked , was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless , considering my laptop is not wireless , it help me out alot . food was very good , quality was great . there was also a flat screen in my room . . . awesome . the hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning . i also enjoyed the gym very much . overall , i enjoyed myself , and i will stay again at the hilton when i return to chicago . 
i already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now i ' m going to write about the location ! i like to walk . this place was close to everything ! ! ! ! the ' taste of chicago ' was on during the Nth of july . let me tell you , this was the best ' taste ' of a city that i have ever been to . it was massive and took N mins to walk there . i took the train in from the airport ( it was around N . N but it was a solid N mins but for N . N , how can you complain ? ) and it was approx a N walk to the hotel . we pretty much walked everywhere . we walked the entire magnificent mile strip . we went to the blue navy or whatever the docks are called . my favourite bar was ' pops for champagne . ' wow . i love champagne . and then of course there was the john hancock centre . and lots of shopping ! 
my husband and i stayed overnight at the affinia . prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel not true . since it was a very special occasion , and also because we were only staying overnight , we didn ' t let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend . however , this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences . i ' ve ever had . first , the smells the linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy . the odors were not mild , and i found it pretty repulsive . i couldn ' t wait to jump out of bed in the morning , to get away from the odors . hard to sleep and certainly didn ' t want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary . i didn ' t discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed . at that point , i chose not to contact housekeeping because ( a ) i was exhausted , and ( b ) i didn ' t want to upset my husband , who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing . also , the bathroom smelled like vinegar . perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by affinia , but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did . incidentally , the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days not a well-maintained property . second , the elevators if you stay above the first few floors , there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar . with so many floors to service , and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday , these elevators took forever to come , and were often full they did . annoying . also , on one occasion , there were several bottles ( water and soda ) left in the elevator clearly , the maintenance crew doesn ' t inspect and clean the common areas frequently . finally , and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived . first , when we booked , we asked for as quiet a room as possible . the hotel is located near northwestern memorial hospital . but , its proximity to michigan ave . , and the lack of accomodations elsewhere ( due to the transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end ) , led us to stay here anyway . at check-in , the clerk noted our request , and said our room was quiet room since it was not ' next to the elevators . ' when we arrived at our room , we discovered that we were across from the elevators . obviously , she was technically correct that we weren ' t next to the elevators , but it was still so close ( N-N feet ) that we could hear the elevator noise . also , since it was a special occasion , we asked if we could upgrade . the disingenuous , snarky , condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade . clearly , the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels , this is a matter of routine , not exception . pretty awful experience all the way around . other reviewers must have very low expectations . can ' t explain any of the good reviews otherwise . 
my wife and i stayed here for a long weekend and it was great . the check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question , and the bar served the best martini i have had in a while . the rooms were well decorated and spacious , although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door . the bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late . i would definitely stay here again ! 
my wife and i stayed at the affinia chicago last week ( in a studio suite , which was not worth the extra payment ) . it was an absolute nightmare ! to begin with , the room is listed as ' oversized ' , when it ' s nothing of the sort . we ' ve previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about N square feet smaller . i believe the only extra space was in the closet , which isn ' t very useful unless you plan on living there ! we had our two sons with us , so we had to make extra sleeping space . our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time , complaining of bugs moving around . he must have been umcomfortable also , as i sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock . the room service is horrible , they took N minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around Npm , and she had to wait up for that . my family would never go back to this hotel , and i highly recommend you also stay well away . 
booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of N a night . the bf and i were amazed when we got there--the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous ! a nice upscale , downtown feel and super comfy beds . we had a fabulous view from the Nth floor that inlcluded a sliver of lake michigan , a sliver of the taste of chicago crowds , and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times . seriously . we had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay--which was fine with us . the hotel consists mainly of N towers and is like a huge , sprawling city inside . but we weren ' t there to stay in the hotel room the entire time . . . we like to get out and explore as much as possible . the location was fantastic . easy walking distance to michigan avenue and the rest of downtown . we walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab . i also highly recommend the urban cruise on the river ( the entrance is right across from the hotel ) --we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise lake michigan a bit too . don ' t park your car here if you don ' t need to--it ' s very expensive . park downtown or ditch the rental car--you won ' t need it anyway , you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab . love chicago and totally recommend this hotel ! 
if i didn ' t have to stay here , i wouldn ' t . without exception , i swear i am not lying , every day of my stay brings a new problem . over the past N months , i have stayed here N times for N nights at a time problems every time . from the wrong food with room service , to room keys that dont work , unrefreshed bath towels , forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service , unclean ice bucket overnight , forgotten room cleaning , inability to connect to the internet . . . . i ' m too tired to keep writing all the problems . for the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel , i expect more . finally , their team is certainly not trained in customer service . the front desk teams have attitudes , and aria ' s hostesses think they are something else . i ' m stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to aon , but i would never go back if i had a choice . the only good thing is the food at aria - outstanding . 
after staying at the sheraton royal orchid hotel in bangkok , i was expecting a similar experience at the chicago sheraton . i had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience . unfortunately , my expectations were not met . for the past N years i stayed at the palmer house in the loop , but thought i ' d try a more modern hotel . pros - location by the chicago river , two blocks from michigan avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes , crepes and french toast cons - check-in assigned me to a city view room when i had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good , but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive bathtub-shower combination worn plumbing fixtures only N sets of towels provided - guest room was small only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - N to N block walk to nearest l-station - concierge couldn ' t explain how to get to the mercury theatre , nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the link cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the link cafe where boarding passes can be printed 
i think the sofitel chicago water tower is a upscale place . i had my wedding there and it was the best of the best . the staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success . the chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts . they also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake . the tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect . the bar was also set up the way i wanted it and even had a champagne fountain . my guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered . the rooms were like suites with a mini bar . they had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom . if you are looking to have a wedding in the chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed ! 
my friends and i were in chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood . well we came across the hotel allegro and immediately fell in love ! everything from the colors , the staff , the architecture , and the pricing were amazing ! we couldn ' t have found a better hotel . the service was impeccable . . talk about a N star hotel for someone with a N star budget ! my friends and i plan on staying here next year when we return . . i can ' t wait until then ! 
if you want a N-star hotel with N-star service , make sure you book your next chicago stay at fairmont chicago millennium park . when i checked in to the hotel , i had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line . i was greeted with no ' thank you for your patience , ' or anything similar . the room was fine , but nothing too glamorous or outstanding . the internet cost N . N day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself . the thing that pushed me over the edge , however , was the valet parking . when i wanted my car in the morning , i had to wait N minutes to be acknowledged ( the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether ) . and for this ' service ' i was charged N . N night ! ! ! ! when i went to complain at the front desk , they just said that sometimes the valets get overwhelmed , and you have to exercise patience ! i will exercise patience as i check out of this hotel ! ! ! 
i was not pleased with my recent stay at the palmer house hilton . my room was not ready upon my arrival and the room i was given was not what i had requested . i had requested a room with N queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that . the air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off . the room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up . i wondered what had happened in the room before i got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener . there was no doorman available or a cart so i had to lug my N suitcases by myself by dragging N of them about N feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items . luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance . my room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff . they promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after N calls to the front desk i finally gave up . i had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that i spent to stay there . 
i had originally chosen the conrad chicago hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance . however , i later learned that i had made a poor choice . upon arrival , the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk . although , when we reached out hotel room , we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite . my family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds . the clerk , after a twenty minute waiting period , was able to find us a suitable room . upon entering , the room was noticably hot . we turned on the air conditioning , and after waiting for thirty minutes , the room remained muggy and humid . i called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room . they promised a repairman within ten minutes . N hour later i called again and remined them that the repairman hadn ' t shown up . they once again promised a speedy repair . while waiting , i discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp . i called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level , but i had to go get them . after all this trouble , i argued that they should bring it up to me , but in the end , i wound up going to get it myself . after returning to my room and waiting another N minutes , the repair man had not shown up . so i called again , and within N minutes the repairman came . he managed to fix the air conditioner , but it was about Nam . we were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off , but as the night went on , we noticed another problem . the air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds . it also emitted a strange odor . upon checking with the front desk , we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired . there were not available rooms left , and being so fed up with this hotel ' s poor service , we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel . i don ' t recommend the conrad chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time . 
the fairmont chicago millenium park hotel provides a rich , beautiful , cultured atmosphere . during my stay , i felt like royalty . with unparalleled design schemes and beautiful , tranquil views , the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss . the guest services department was second-to-none . the staff throughout the hotel were obviously concerned with pleasing the customer and making my stay as wonderful as possible . when dealing with a staff member at fairmont , i felt as if i were the only guest in the place . the food and drink selections were vast and fit for a king . i will definitely recommend fairmont chicago millenium park to my friends and colleagues . i will also greatly look forward to my next stay . 
elegant and modernized hotel with great staff . location is wonderful . the health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout . i will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices . 
we really enjoyed our stay at the palmer house hilton . we were in chicago for a weekend stay , and wanted something close to state street , and convenient to the theatre district and the museums , and michigan ave . shopping . this is a grand old hotel , with just about every amenity one could wish for . the lobby is fabulous , and the hotel also has some nice restaurants . our room had a nice king sized bed , and was pretty cozy . hotel employees were very nice and helpful to us . i would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a ' grand hotel ' type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown chicago . you will definitely feel special . 
triple a rate with upgrade to view room was less than N which also included breakfast vouchers . had a great view of river , lake , wrigley bldg . tribune bldg . most major restaurants , shopping , sightseeing attractions within walking distance . large room with a very comfortable bed . 
the downtown chicago hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions . staying with a hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always , the room was clean and impeccably neat , the staff friendly and very capable . the wireless access and big flat screen tv were an added plus too ! best of all , it is a pet-friendly hotel , something that is unusual in bigger city N-diamond hotels . thanks , chicago hilton , for a great stay ! 
my daughter and i woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . when we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . i then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . both were out of service ! ! ! ! i am glad there wasn ' t an emergency . as we were exited the pool area i ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean . . . . never heard back . one more thing , in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table . within N minutes my N year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding . they need to update this piece of furniture . 
the affinia manhattan is fantastic ! my husband and i stayed there when we went to visit my sister . i loved the room . it was one of the best hotel beds we have ever slept in . the view was incredible . manhattan is one of the most beautiful places i have ever been . the staff was very helpful as well . they had no problem going out of their way to be helpful . i would suggest this hotel to anybody ! 
will start by saying the employees were wonderful , especially in the restaurant bar employees , could not have been nicer . . . . . what appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyond . . . . unfortunately , that ' s where it ends ! the rooms , in my opinion , appeared different then pictures and were worn and ratty . . . you know , uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area . . . the first room i was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my window ! ! i kid you not they seemed as if they were about N-N ft from my window ! ! and this was after i specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent view . . i was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly , again . . . just worn out ! ! ! not a N star hotel , this seemed to be closer to a N , perhaps being extremely kind N star . . . i travel on business so i know the difference . . . i merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand ! i complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit , she made sure the door was fixed asap . they gave me a bottle of wine to compensate . . which i utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next N days . . . . i wanted to give omni a shot . . . big mistake . . . unfortunately , brought a friend with me to show her how great chicago was and i was soooo embarrassed , as i had chosen the hotel . . . she was extremely disappointed as well . . . should have gone with my first instinct which was the conrad ! ! lesson learned ! 
ambassador east is an awesome hotel ! ! ! understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel . my family stayed at the ambassador for two nights in a suite . very clean room with great space . the best part of the ambassador is not the rooms though . the staff was extremely courteous , especially the concierge . if you stay here you have to go to the pump room . the restaurant is full of nostalgia , the staff is great , and the food is excellent . great atmosphere and music . 
terrible time at the talbott . when i planned my vacation to chicago i called ahead and made reservations to stay here . when i went to check in i was told i didn ' t have a reservation , knowing my credit card was charged i argued with the guy who was working . finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else . thankfully they knew how to use the computer . i go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet . i could not believe it when i complained , i was told to spray some air freshener . i had to go visit family . when i got back my room key did not work . once again there i was complaining to the helpless employee . he told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet . i could not believe the mentality of this guy . i had one more night reserved , i could not take it anymore and i went and spent the rest of my vacation at my aunts house . i would not recommend the talbott to anyone . 
i recently stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel . it was my first time staying at this hotel and , i am sorry to say , it was my last time staying there . one of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise . the walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night i could hear my neighbors in the next room talking . although i could not quite make out the words of their conversations , i could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer . in addition , i was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door , presumably on the way to their rooms . admittedly , i am a light sleeper , but this was ridiculous . if you decide to stay here , i suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out . when i checked mine , i found that i was being charged a rate higher than the one that i was supposed to be charged . i had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me ( and the front desk service is woefully slow ) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected . finally , though i had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated , i cannot believe that statement was accurate . the room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn . all in all , i round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing . next time i will arrange to stay elsewhere . 
i don ' t know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others . this hotel was for me over priced , fingerprints on the walls , stains in the bathroom , funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning , parking valet was time consuming , and same thing with the elevator . the back to the N ' s furniture is not for me , and what about the breakfast ? better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer . oh sure it is a hilton , woopee ! you pay for the privilege of sleeping there . saw a couple of bed bugs , but took a shower in the morning , and they seemed to wash away . i won ' t be back to hilton homewood suites again . i ' d rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money . think that i ' ll be happier as well . 
my husband and i and our N month old took a quick trip to chicago . we stayed one night at the palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel . i guess i am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel . yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small i couldn ' t set up a pack and play for my son . i had to call and ' upgrade ' my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep . the lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a holiday inn . the wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty . i will never stay there again . 
don ' t stay here ! my family and i stayed here for a weekend trip . the staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them . the rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it hadn ' t been dusted in ages . overall bad service and not worth the money . 
i needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one . first of all the prices for one night are extremely high . the workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities . then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep . also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting . the beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all . overall i am very disappointed with this hotel . 
stayed at the chicago affinia dec N thru dec N and was very impressed with the staff , the room , and the location . close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great . of course , there were many other restaraunts nearby as well . i had a little trouble figuring out the heat , but it was fine once i learned how to set it . they were working on the hotel , so we got a great rate . but the work never bothered us . the room was great , with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise . i would definately stay here again and would recommend to others . 
the ambassador east hotel , located in downtown chicago , is one of the best hotels i ' ve ever stayed in . my wife and i went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the ambassador east on a hotel booking website . their rates are very , very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide . i was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn ' t find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend . i was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer , which is nice because most places in chicago are very impersonal . all in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area .

the hotel monaco is a hotel that some say has ' character ' . i found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and ' contemporary furniture ' . i found the fact that you have to be a member of the kimpton rewards club to get free wi-fi access to be annoying at the least . because of their pet-friendly policy , our room smelled like a wet dog , and a canine ' guest ' down the hall kept us up all night with his howling . perhaps the dog would have howled less if the N-hour room service were faster . we waited an hour and a half for our order meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at N N pm until midnight ! all in all , we would not stay here again . the views and location are great , but for the money there are better places to stay in chicago . 
i stayed two nights at the hilton chicago . that was the last time i will be staying there . when i arrived , i could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking . they wanted at least N . what am i paying for when i stay there for the night ? the website also touted the clean linens . the room was clean and i believe the linens were clean . the problem was with all of the down pillows etc . don ' t they know that people have allergies ? i also later found out that this hotel allows pets . i think that this was another part of my symptoms . if you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks i suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay . i did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking . beware hidden costs . i will try somewhere else in the future . not worth the money or the sneezing all night . 
my stay at the hotel monaco recently was fantastic . we got a very reasonable price for our stay ( especially since we were a aaa member ) , and there was plenty of perks to utilize in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few . another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that , upon request , the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room . how cool is that ! the staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable . i would definitely recommend the hotel monaco to anyone in the downtown chicago area . 
my husband and i made a reservation at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers , for a much needed weekend getaway . we took off work early friday to beat traffic . once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking . we drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel . upon checking in we were informed that the floor , where our room was located , was in the process of having the carpets cleaned . we decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation . we took the elevator , which smelled like urine , up to our room . we did see some carpet cleaning machines , unattended , in the hallway . i hoped for the sake of safety , no children were staying on this floor . we walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine . the overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us . we called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms . he rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings . just then , the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and i could not hear anything else my husband said . we decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel . it was an awful experience . 
my husband and i decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the talbott hotel in chicago . we decided to book the ' personally yours romance package ' for our stay . when we arrived at the hotel , the staff was very friendly and approachable . the personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch . each night , we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed . the personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and i to see a chicago cubs baseball game . i would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away . 
when i had to visit chicago for business i asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the hotel allegro . after my stay i can honestly say that i agree . from the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities , everything was thought of . the only place i find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home . i now know where i will be staying every time i have business in this city , and anyone i know who is doing the same will hear so . 
on a recent trip to chicago to attend a major trade show i had the pleasure of staying with the sofitel chicago water tower . i say stay with as that is how they make you feel , from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return . the rooms are clean , chic and roomy , the beds - the best i have slept in , bathrooms large and super clean . what can i say , my new home when in chicago . . . 
my family and i stayed at the hyatt on wacker dr . on march N , N . we were excited about the great price we got for your N-star hotel through priceline . unfortunately , we were not impressed . in the past , we have stayed at the hyatt in downtown san diego for spring break on the marina , but chose to stay closer to home this year . the room was not clean to our standards when we arrived , even though we paid for an upgrade . we asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after . upon our return , nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so i can only assume , it wasn ' t even checked as promised . we only had N towels for the N of us and had to call for more . they were promptly delivered but room service took N minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice ! the curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming , the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it , the honor bar fridge was gouged and dirty , too ! the mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all . . . . there were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well . very disappointing to say the least . i have buyer ' s remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds ! we were compensated for our upgrade - N . N but given the price of parking , taxes , and etc . at this point i wouldn ' t recommend this hyatt to anyone . my husband travels and uses his hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your N-star hotel . i felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility .
