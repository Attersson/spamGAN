came here on a whim to get a quick bute . . . ended up at queens comfort . we ate the capn crunch chkn sandwich and a fried shrimp po boy both with roumelade sauce . . . amaz-balls is all i can say . . . since i ' m allergic to spinach the waiter acomodated my salad for ff . our waiter jordan aka jojo was the bomb . com . . . a great experience ! 
cheap food ! N for N dumplings . soup for N . N . our lunch for N people was less than N ! not sure if the high rating is due to the prices , but food is ok . it would be a nice place to stop by for a quick bite to eat . we ordered at the counter . there are stacks of paper menus that you can grab . order what you want . pay . then find a seat . they ' ll shout out when your order is ready . no thrills kinda place . there wasn ' t even water or tea . but they do have a fridge stocked with drinks . 
though i can ' t necessarily pronounce it , assaggini di roma is a fantastic italian restaurant for a romantic dinner or special event . to begin with , the food is fantastic . before we even ordered drinks , the servers gave us a small portion of complementary bruschetta . when it came to appetizers , fresh mozzarella with tomato and artichoke hearts were well-prepared and robust . for entrees , we ordered the stuffed calimari ( with crabmeat ) and the fruta del mar ( seafood over pasta , including calimari , mussles , and shrimp ) . both portions were generous and flavored perfectly . in both dishes , the calimari was particularly well cooked . it ' s not the quietest place to eat , as they have seem to have live music most nights . the entertainment was a bit silly , but as the night went on we warmed up the the rat pack covers and the rodney dangerfield impressions . all in all , this is a great place to go if you expect to spend a little money . the only drawbacks with assaggini di roma is the far flung location -- it ' s a good N minute walk through the ironbound from penn station , but that adds a bit to the restaurant ' s off-the-radar charm . that said , i don ' t get the chance to eat in newark often , but this could very well be the best italian restaurant in the city . 
they have the best pizza i have ever had in nj . i can ' t really speak for other items on their menu , but this is the place to go for pizza . you ' re also going to want to finish the pizza on site , since the consistency ( crispy , thin crust with creamy , melty , cheesy goodness ) changes if you try to reheat it . park tavern is truly a hidden gem that the locals like to keep to themselves . . . and many , many thanks to my uncle who shared it with me ! 
i loved jacobs pickles but the other night the service wasn ' t there . they were rude at the hostess table and rushed us out . i went to some other spots around there and decided i wanted fried oreos . when i went to pick them up i was short changed by N dollars and the hostess argued with me so i just left . i ' m sad this happened at one of my go tos . 
i do think this is the best sushi place in burlington , and especially love the sushi pizza . however , i have never had good service . always slow . one waitress seemed to feel that waiting on tables was quite the burden to her day . it never seems to be busy , so it confuses me as to why service is always slow . and often times they are out of things that are on the menu . i will go back because it is delicious , and i like the location , out of the way of church street , and easy parking . i try to leave my past judgements of bad service behind each time i go , but so far , service hasn ' t improved . but . . . yay for sushi pizza ! ! 
wow . this place was disappointing . bland , overcooked eggs , sky-high prices , and an unimaginative menu . furthermore , most types of toast cost extra , there is an unconscionable N split plate charge , and the overall menu-vibe is that the place is out to nickle and dime you to death . the food was average at best -- i ' ve had better at greasy spoons . faux-gourmet selections . 
this place isn ' t any fancy joint , but the noodles here are very hearty . i absolutely love their food , especially the noodles . they are not soggy at all and very springy at each bite . what i really like is their homemade hot sauce . i never had hot sauce like the ones here . i asked them if they sell these homemade hot sauce and it turns out that they do , so i bought a small little jar home with me ) 
this place sucks . . . over charge and can ' t get an order right to save their business . don ' t call them on it as it is either your fault for not knowing how to order . . . like no onions is a hard request , or they don ' t answer their phone . stay away , much better options in the area for far less . . . 
i went to el cocotero on friday night with my friend and thought it was incredible ! the waitstaff was unbelievable--on top of everything , super nice , gave great recommendations and were super cute ! the arepas are so delicious ! we had several meat and fish filled arepas and cachapas . the guarapita was so refreshing and smooth ! plus , everything is wheat free ! the warm staff really makes you feel welcome--it ' s almost like you ' re eating in someone ' s hom . i can ' t wait to bring a date there ! 
while having lunch break in their sister bar , the gingerman in southern norwalk i got to talking with the bartender about the company ' s new bar in new haven the cask republic . he said that it was the gingerman of new haven , and i def . should check it out . i had no idea there was any other beer bar in new haven except for bar . a couple of friends of mine decided to make a saturday night of bar hopping throughout new haven . i suggested we try the cask republic ! they agreed once we saw the menu ! ( aka the beer menu ! ) we were welcomed to the cask republic by a bubbly blonde who quickly started making beer suggestions after my friend asked the cliche question of " whats good here " and to our surprise they were spot on . ( if you come here you have to try their selection of stone beer ) not only was our service great but the food was excellent ! i am a big fan of prime N ' s burger and still believe it is the greatest in new haven but i believe the cask republic is a close second . the burger was extremely tender and it was also at the right price , it even came with a soup ! ( i ordered the clam chowder , its not traditional but it is very good ! ) all in all we didn ' t end up bar hopping that night in new haven , we ended up beer hopping at the cask republic . it ' s a beer lovers dream
never disappoints ! ! ! this place is always great . . by far danny meyers best restaurant ! doesn ' t matter if your eating at the tavern or in the dinning room the food is always amazing ! ! ! ! don ' t miss this place if you in the city - its a must ! ! ! 
this place is excellent ! i should add to the other reviews -- il bambino is not only about sumptuous paninis . they have an incredible assortment of tapas and crostini , and the place could stand on the strength of these offerings alone . truly delicious and affordable . fuck you manhattan . you can ' t have it both ways , but astoria can . bring a bottle of wine and kick back . oh , and they play good music too . 
no taste and bland . service not so great . 
i doubt it is any good for you but i have to say the duroc pork sandwiche is amazing . drown it in sir racha and double the goodness . the yam sandwich is a close second . you will love the catfish too . greasy delicious sandwiches full of meat how you dazzle me . 
words cannot describe how good the food was ! 
i really enjoyed it here . the only reason i couldnt give a N star they should give you miso soup or a salad for free for any order of sushi etc . . . its a bit pricey but worth it . they give you a lot of the actual fish in the rolls . i love how they use grain rice rather than white . the sexy shrimp roll was my favorite ! 
best pizza and great service
ignore the hype about pepe ' s or modern - this is the best pizza in new haven . the beers brewed in house are pretty nice , too . the bar has a nice quasi-industrial ambiance , with copper brew tanks right out in the dining room . the major drawback is the inconsistent and occasionally rude service . having come here enough , i ' ve realized they guy who works behind the desk is a real jackass , so i try not to blame the waiters waitresses ( who have to put up with him ) . among several other incidents , one time upon trying to split a bill between multiple credit cards , i overheard the guy at the desk tell the waitress " next time throw their cards back in their faces . " 
in an area where there is little variety in the culinary division , m-saigon might be a favorite of a food adventurer . hell , if m-saigon was situated here where i live , i might be a regular . but , if i lived in burlington , and i was craving for vietnamese food , i ' d be willing to drive a little further to pho dang in winooski instead . i think the food there is way much better than here in m-saigon . everything we ordered here seemed watered down-- the soup , the sauce , the bubble teas . 
came here for the first time with my daughter last night looking for an alternative to eating pho at the lemongrass . we were greeted by an attentive staff who understood the menu and made positive recommendations . we started with the spring rolls which included both fresh lettuce leaves and fresh mint which added a nice flavor twist . the spring rolls were delicious and tasted just like the ones i make at home . our waiter commented that it is a tedious job , but they make them at the restaurant daily . as a main dish , i had the combination pho while my daughter had the pho tai nam . she wanted to try the grilled pork w vermicelli noodle dish also , but knew having both pho and vermicelli w pork would be too filling . so our waiter recommended that she order a side of the grilled pork . it was an excellent and tasty suggestion . the broth was absolutely amazing ! and , as any pho gourmand knows , the main ingredient for any successful pho restaurant is the broth . i ' ve tried pho at restaurants around the country and in thailand , and this broth ranks at or near the top . at the end of our meal , " t " , the owner , joined us to request our comments . t mentioned that he recently hired a new head chef and that the dishes had improved . i couldn ' t agree more ! although the ambience and decor doesn ' t meet the standards of the lemongrass , if your in the mood for great pho , this is the place to go . oh , and they also serve vietnamese hot pot which i ' ll be sure to try the next time i visit ! 
i definitely agree with everyone else here - the food is overpriced and bland . i remember walking out of there last night telling my husband that if i didn ' t order the mexican street corn as a side with my entree and the pitcher of ( red ) sangrias that we shared , i would have been really upset . -appetizers we started with the queso fondito with peppers which was okay . it was very greasy , but was good enough to settle a craving that my husband had . -for the entrees , i ordered the carnitas tacos which automatically came with a side of beans . the was really disappointed because the pork meat itself - although tender had no flavor . the worst part was the side of beans . . . they were semi warm and still had the aluminum can taste . . . there was absolutely nothing added to them ! ! my husband ordered the short rib tamale which he really enjoyed , but the portion was a tapa-like portion at a fabulous price of N . -for dessert , my husband got the churros with hot chocolate ( which was luke warm ) , and i ordered the chocolate tres leches . the desserts were not great but not horrible . -service at first , the service was fantastic . . . we had our appetizer and first round of margaritas delivered to our table within N minutes of being seated . however , once we received our dinners and sangria , it ' s like the waiter forgot we existed for the remaining N minutes that we were there . -overall if we didn ' t have a groupon , we would have been really upset but with the discount , the bill wasn ' t too bad for a mediocre meal in philly . -tip if you want authentic mexican food , take a drive up to conshy for el limon . 
i give it N stars because it ' s only good when i ' m drunk . anytime i went here in a sober state it wasn ' t that good . just becareful when you sit on the fountain area-that ' s really not a seat- and the red sauce . too much red sauce will ruin the taste but load up as much as you can on the white sauce . 
i thought all chain restaurants were bad till i came here . this is the worst of the worst . the atmosphere and drinks are good but the food is horrible . the burgers at burger king are Nx ' s better than what you get here . the place is obviously known for their wings which are decent but the rest of the menu is just terrible . good to watch games and have some drinks but stay away from the menu especially the burgers . 
back on track at giorgio ' s for sure . . . went the other night and everything was amazing like i had usually expected until a few lackluster appearances the past couple visits . there was a large crowd , but that added to the atmosphere and it was fun . the food was top notch and we all loved every bite to say the least . giorgio was walking about as usual and he ' s a trip . . . great owner who likes to invite people back again and again . do yourself a favor and head down here anytime ya can ! 
i am very impressed , truthfully i wasn ' t expecting much . the food is of this world with top notch service that ' s super fast and attentive . price is very reasonable , i would eat here every day if i could . byob the amount of business they do is amazing . even if they had a bigger place the line would still be out the door . 
great food ! love the service . i ordered the scallop dinner and the scallops were cooked perfect , but i wish the entree was served with two sides . i love the fact that it was a byob ! the reason why i give it four stars is because the decor could be updated . however , i will go back again ! 
i came here with my girls for a little bridal shower brunch back in september , the wait was a tad long but the host checked up on us and would give u supdates on our wait . which made the wait less of an anxiety especially since my bridesmaid had her little sin , my ring bearer . when we were seated we got an amazing waiter ( i dont remember his name ) he was hilarious and constantly checked up on our mimosas . it was so busy but we were never neglected . everyone ' s food was amazing . i had the huge pancakes ! and the egg benedict , my first time trying and i gotta say i crave it every morning lol . this is such an awesome place . ! 
we loved the place , i went with my friend and we had such a delightful meal . we went for sunday brunch . . . i had the plaid hush and was soooo good ! the service is fast and efficient , drinks are so good . i hope they keep the great quality for years to come . 
great for breakfast . we stopped on our way to the art-museum district . plenty of choices , good service , and liked the way we were not rushed out the door despite the busy atmosphere . thanks for a nice break in a hectic day . 
great service . great mojitos . had N course lunch menu N , N . 
we had a great meal here a couple of saturday back . we had great glass of house white and then sat down , it is cosy but not in a way i felt intruded into my night at all . i loved the atmosphere and the staff were really good and so helpful . we ordered the israeli street fair , it was really good . definitely order the crispy cauliflower , it was the best i have ever had . oh and the hummus , oh the hummus , it was just amazing . then we had grilled lamb chops , so well cooked and sooo nice . also the boneless organic half chicken " under a brick " , which i could eat again right now . the prices are reasonable and again the food was just great . the staff is amazing extremely i will be back . 
the first time walking into the restaurant was for their bathroom . since there ' s no public bathroom anywhere in soho , i had to run into a restaurant for one . i fell in love with the restaurant decor the moment i walk in . i love the weird poker cards stuck on top of the ceiling . lol . nevermind how the food will taste , i ' m coming here for sure . the food was up to par as the decoration . i got their tuna tartar salad and their red yellow pepper has the texture as a fresh sashimi . steak tartar and onion soup was great as well . we actually got really lucky since my friend waited less than N min before getting a seat . so if you don ' t want " crepe that is so dry and overcooked it reminds us of saw dust " , you should try going to the restaurant when it ' s not so busy . 
this is my favorite restaurant in new haven . if you ' re looking for more traditional sushi , go somewhere else ( like sushi on chapel ) , and if you want a bargain , head somewhere else as well ( like sushi palace in hamden ) . but miya ' s can ' t be beat for sheer ingenuity . i frequent miya ' s for their fun , fruity drinks ( the kama sutra ) and amazing sushi . i went here during restaurant week and had an incredible N course meal including their fantastic tokyo fries , crispy noodles of potatoes with a spicy aioli- sort of like eating just the crunchy batter of tempura , but crunchier and tastier . the softest french kisses live up to their name in fantasticness ( warm scallop sashimi in a sauce ) . shoot , you can order pretty much anything on the absurdly long menu and enjoy it , though i particularly enjoy anything that includes fruit ( notably cranberries and papaya ) and cheese ( goat over brie , though that ' s good too ) . unless you ' re a cheap college student , stay away on late thursday , friday , and saturday nights , when they have their extremely popular N sushi specials and cheap pitchers . if , however , you fall into that category , come join us at miya ' s every weekend ! one more thing i ' ve had the most expensive roll on the menu , the kanibaba ( N for five pieces of potato , soft-shell crab , dill , havarti , and those little tiny crabs perched atop ) , and while it was amazing , it ' s not worth N unless you have many gift certificates like i did . 
i was just telling somebody that every time i go here the food is always really , really good , as is the service , so i realized it was probably worth doing a yelp review too . the crispy shrimp salad is great . so it ' s the pretzel dusted calimari . 
this place has the best falafel outside of mamouns . it is herby and crispy on the outside . grilled lamb is also good but the N huge falafel is where it ' s at . 
i would just like to share my experience at barbuzzo with everyone . now i don ' t live anywhere near philly , in fact i ' m in the coast of nj . i made a reservation here for restaurant week . both me and my gf have been going to different restaurants during rest week for a few yrs now . i called up barbuzzo to see if they do in fact participated in which they said they absolutely do . so i made a reservation online . i get there today to be greeted and told that they do not in fact participate in restaurant week on saturdays even though i have the call log and reservation info saved on my phone to prove it . . . i called the manager over to discuss this with him discussing that i traveled over N hours to get there and how i made the reservation for restaurant week and proceeded to show him the confirmation on my phone . not only did he refuse to serve us the rest week menu he would not make any accommodations for us whatsoever . . . i will never even go close to this place ever again . . . thanks for ruining my girlfriends birthday . . 
i can ' t believe this place is so highly rated on here . it is truly a failure of the yelp-bot or something . if you ' ll notice , most of the good reviews are quite old . we ordered takeout and got three different apps chicken pandan , shrimp wonton and beef satay . the pandan and shrimp were just plain nasty . they tasted the opposite of fresh . like , doubleplus unfresh . blecht ! the beef satay was tolerable but skimpy and tough . i had the beef curry fried rice , which was okay . the rice was a bit mushy . the flavor wasn ' t all that great . mostly just spicy . my coworkers got a couple of variations on pad thai , and they concur with the " meh " assessment . kind of bland . just spicy . when we called our order in , they said they don ' t deliver , contrary to their profile on here . fair warning . there are definitely better places around . blecht ! i still can ' t get the nasty taste of that shrimp wonton out of my mouth . 
good , but not as good as sonny ' s , campo ' s , chink ' s or genos . 
i hate giving subpar reviews , but . . . N stars go to the view and the potential . the service was completely lacking . when i ask a question about your menu , and your answer is " it ' s my first day " , that is a failure or management or ownerships part for putting you on the floor too soon . but when i have to get up from my table , walk to the bar , and ask what beers you have , because the server never returned to the table , that just means you shouldn ' t be working in the hospitality industry . and then to the food . . . ordered the peel and eat shrimp . not bad , actually kinda tasty , but back to that service thing , if we ask for no old bay seasoning , it probably means we ' d prefer if our shrimp doesn ' t arrive with an ample dusting of old bay seasoning . . . ordered the northwest bucket . king crab shell was soft and rubbery , snow crab was lackluster , and the shrimp were overcooked . but the N small red potatoes were good . . . now i get it , i do . you have to know what you ' re getting when you eat at a spot like this . i ' m originally from the gulf coast of florida and places like this are a dime a dozen down there . but the food and service need to be as good as the view . 
my husband and i were major regulars at marathon on the square , and it was our local neighborhood place to grab a casual dinner . the food started changing and going downhill prior to the renovation . i went back last night with a friend for dinner post renovation . here is what we ordered . . . my friend had a few orange juices , we each had a matzoh ball soup , and i ordered a dinner size caesar salad . . . no chicken , just the salad . the total came to about N which with the tip ( the staff was delightful , as my friend had to leave suddenly and they wrapped up our food for us ) came to about N . for virtually nothing of a meal . the salad was about N for goodness sake . it is so incredibly overpriced now . . . i can go to smith and wollensky and get a much more interesting salad that will serve N people for just slightly more . i gladly pay money for something special . . . but N bucks for a caesar salad and N bucks a glass for plain orange juice ? come on ! they have lost my husband and me as clients until they readjust their prices , which are insane . 
i went to salugo , saturday night , march N , N . i was seated and placed my order . after approximately N N hr i questioned where my appetizer was after seeing two couples who sat down after me receive their food . i was told " we are very busy " . the owner chef then came out of the kitchen and wanted to know why there was a problem . when we tried to explain to him he , rather then take any responibility , he told us if we weren ' t happy we could leave " . i ' ve never been treated like this in a restaurant and think it was very unprofessional . if this is the way they handle a problem in their kitchen i would never recommend their restaurant to anyone . 
enjoyed an excellently prepared meal w N friends , all courses were absolutely wonderful , our service never fell below great considering N of our party were prior to Nnite impossible N please but excellent service prevailed , i have a new favorite italian restaurant , thanx again
went there on N N N this place wasn ' t all that great , all the reviews on yelp fooled me ! i just didn ' t feel comfy at this place all , the decor wasn ' t all that inviting either . food was on the salty side N stars at most compare to other french places in the city . the zagat and yelp reviews are bs . . . i end up paying around N for dinner at this place with N apps , N drinks and N main dish , i feel like i could have went else where like almonds , antibes or la sirene to get a better ambiance and better food for less or the same place . now going again . . . 
i enjoyed this place . it was nestled on the busy street in winooski and walking in was like a blast from the past . everything mac cheese . it was a really filling meal . i got the chicken parm mac cheese . i ' ve never seen that much cheese before . the peanut butter and jelly deep-fried sandwich with fluff was so good . probably clogged artery . the mixed fries was the best way to go . i recommend this place if you ' re looking for a really filling meal . not the spot if you ' re looking for light and airy . overall very delicious food . 
delicious ! ! ! ! everything is good . . from cupcakes to donuts to sandwiches . . love it here
this crabcake patty is the best thing i ' ve ever eaten in between bread ! perfectly crisp on the outside , fresh tomatoes and lettuce , some lemon juice , mayo , and a soft bun . best . lunch . ever ! 
this place is great . fresh sushi is hard to come by . i have never been disappointed with anything i have ordered from here . my daughter loves the onion soup and spicy kani salad is always delicious . the black pepper tuna salad is also another fave . my favorite rolls are the dancing wasabi , volcano , and million dollar roll . the sushi is always delicious and fresh . my mother even had the one of the hibachi dinners one night and loved it . my only complaint would be the service , not that it isn ' t good , but the one waitress can be a little unpleasant at times . some nights she is great , and others not so much . also , if it ' s really crowded you might wait a litle for your food but it ' s not too bad . 
went there the other day for the first time and beautiful decor . my brother in law had an scrambler with side corned beef hash and he loved it . me and my boyfriend had the chicken pesto and what can i say one was beyond amazing and one was not . i sent mines back and the deli guy there " who we later found out made our good sandwich " was very plight and had our meal back to the table in no time . i get back in line after our meal to get few pastry and when it came to my turn the lady at the register walked away and ignored me . she walked by twice and totally ignored me i go to the deli kid and ask to see a manager and the same lady who ignored me was the manager . but beside that it was pretty alright . 
had dinner at carmine ' s on our first night in new york . the server " forgot " to put my order in gf . needless to say in about an hour later i was sick in the middle of times square . horrifying . i spoke with mario the gm . he was very apolpgetic . offered free dinner . ( not very helpful being i am back home ) 
good pizza , we only had a sit-down meal one time here , the service was lacking , but good food . perfect for take out on football sundays . 
we ordered the scallop entr e last friday , but it ' s too too too salty for us , and it costs N for only N pieces jumbo scallop , i don ' t think we will reorder this entr e again . 
i can ' t say enough good things about this place . the sushi is great , and service is the best in the city . if you ' re looking for a friendly sushi bar restaurant with friendly staff and patrons look no further than zento ! 
the food was excellent , the service was over the top ! it ' s hard to pick a favorite off the menu , since everything is soo delicious ! eat there quite regularly and never have any issues with food or service . an excellent place to eat , with wonderful service and great serving sizes ! 
pros best tacos you ' ll have in philadelphia . don ' t even question it when you know it ' s true . cons . if you like walking distance from it you ' ll spend around N a week for the rest of your life on tacos . you have no choice when you know what you ' re in for . 
their not lying when their sign reads " best baklava in the city " , it ' s also affordable . 
if it was food alone , N stars without hesitation . spaghetti with seafood , fried calamari zucchini , and pizza about as authentic italian as they come ! sauces were great and homemade pasta tasted great ! now for the service . . . my family came in around N pm and the restaurant was pretty empty . the staff did a pretty good job of ignoring us until i finally flagged down a waiter . not sure if he was assigned to our area , but there were no other waiters around . his attitude was like we were bothering him . he hurried us through our order , and then disappeared ( did show up at next table , regular someone who knew the chef . . . and boy was he kissing up ! ) . our water glass was filled exactly once , and aside from that , there was not much service . nobody bother to clear off anything , offer dessert , etc . at the end of the meal , i stacked all our plates in the middle of the table and waited watched . it took N minutes before someone noticed and took them . i counted staff members walking by at least N times and nobody noticed ? ! ? ! the waiter never showed up again ( nor did any other wait staff ) . i don ' t recall the last time i did this , but i flagged down a manager and complained . he was very polite and apologetic , and offered us a discount as well as free dessert ( skipped dessert since we just wanted to leave ) . i told him the food was fantastic , but i wanted him to be aware of the poor service . with such poor service , it wont matter in the long run how good the food is ! here is hoping things improve should we ever go back ! 
we had a wonderful time . yes , they still have the blowfish hanging from the ceiling and the canoe with the plants hanging way up in the center of the room , but everything looked cleaner . even the bathroom looked better . they were N of us and we ordered pu pu platter ( appetizers ) for N people and it was delicious and plenty enough for each of us to sample about N different pieces . the appetizers were served in a platter with a fire in the center so that we can heat up our food . needless to say , the fire was hit with our kids . we each had entries which were very good . the adults ordered drinks . the menu didn ' t have a description of what was in the drinks and i asked the waiter and i didn ' t like the liquor that was used and the waiter offered a different alcohol . he asked me what i wanted . that ' s a first for me . anyway i didn ' t want to mess with the drink and ordered something that i liked the ingredients . the waiters were very attentive and they refilled our water and tea often . i like that the staff is older because i get tired of young college kids who are inexperienced , don ' t care about the patrons and don ' t know the menu . it looks like this staff ' s been here for a while and i am happy to see older folks working . it is not the cheapest but it is nice when you have a large group and want a special place to eat . 
italian food to its finest , the pumpkin ravioli with the nut sauce is the best ravioli i ' ve ever had . can ' t wait to go back already ! 
this restuarant is just one on a list of many that have rodent problems . see link . fox N and inside edition did a report of rodents running rampid throughout the restaurant . and the owner says " since i ' ve worked here i ' ve never seen anything that would suggest rodents . . . " 
i went with me and the gals and i found semen on my pants and i shit my pants so much shrek butt fucked me in the anus and fucked everyone else in there and fucked a donkey sooooooooooooooooooooooo hard farqueer died . 
simply put , if you like cambodian food ( and who doesn ' t ? ! ) this is the place to try . they have a wide variety of sandwiches which aren ' t outrageous in price and they ' re all really fresh tasting . the tiger shrimp sandwich is my favorite but my friend swears by the pork belly . check it out ! ! 
this easily one of my top N favorite diners in nj . my parents drive from passaic county all the time just o have brunch here
this place is fantastic ! ! ! this is probably my favorite vietnamese place in south philly . the food there is delicious yet cheap , and the waitstaff is phenomenal . whenever i order seafood pho , the shrimp and squid are always perfectly cooked . . . . which is more than i can say for many other places . 
spent a three day stint in burlington , vt which was a relaxing getaway from nyc . pingala became our ' go to ' cafe in spite of so many great options in this town . the food was amazing - not for vegan standards - but any standards . they didn ' t hold back on flavor . we enjoyed the hash and scramble wrap with chipotle sauce which was filled with peppers , onions , and potatoes scrambled tofu - very zesty . and also the vanilla , cinnamon , banana pancakes with local maple syrup . the indoor space is warm and cozy - surrounded by windows and art . the outdoor space right next to the river is calm and soothing - a good place to work and think . i ' ve eaten a lot of great food , but this place has a comfortable vibe along with great food that made us come back . there ' s also a yoga studio next door if the mood strikes . 
silk city is a place where all the hipsters used to dance until the barbary became the beacon of the northern center city dance scene for people who wouldn ' t normally go to the del . ave . hot spots , but not silk is a very different kind of place . they ' ve since hired a new chef and redefined their image , both culinary and musically . while the food has gotten much better , the club aspect has gotten much worse . even though they manage to bring in some of the better ( premier ) djs ( mostly hip-hop , bounce , b ' more , etc . ) , the crowd that they bring in it not the most desirable . seems mostly like a bunch of bridge and tunnelers or business types that think that going to a club is more about buying a N cocktail and drinking it slowly on the dance floor so everyone can see them . the food is another story . it ' s sort of like diner gourmet , which may seem like a cheesy idea , but it ' s executed perfectly and i ' ve never had a bad meal there . the service is great as well . the staff sometimes seems a bit taxed , but i think given the nature of the venue , it ' s totally forgivable . final verdict go to silk city if you want to eat , or eat and dance , but not just dance . if you like the style of music they play , then just look up other venues where the same djs are playing . e . g . emynd bo bliz also do another night at the barbary , ed blammoi can be seen at pyt or teri ' s in south philly , dj apt one can be seen all over the place , etc . 
what would appear to be a cute , quaint little coffee shop and cafe , ( run by all girls ? ? ? ) was quite a roller coaster of an experience for me last week . i went in hoping to find some cheap breakfast on-the-go . i had heard some good things from friends who live on passyunk , so i figured i ' d try it out . i wound up paying N dollars or something like that and walking out with all sorts of baked goods and bagels and things i didn ' t need . ( apparently there ' s a N dollar credit card minimum , so come prepared with cash ) . my N ounce oatmeal cost like N dollars because i wanted to add some raisins and brown sugar to it . a chocolate chip muffin cost me somewhere near N dollars , and i hoped that would be the saving grace , after the oatmeal which was cold and clumpy was promptly discarded in the trash . it wasn ' t . it tasted like the inside of a cardboard box . luckily , the smoothie was delicious . . . ( i think i got the berry mix or something like that . ) idk , perhaps their cooked breakfasts are better than the stuff they have up front . the only other strange thing was i saw a girl who i ' m pretty sure was an employee , as she had been standing behind the counter , walk out crying . to whoever that barista girl is i hope you ' re feeling better . 
super fun little spot ! easily the cheapest and best meal to be had in ny . fed three people for under N ! recommend N and N
i went in for brunch the other day ( which was delicious , but not what this review is about ! ) and saw adorable custom halloween sugar cookies for sale . after chatting with the waitstaff , i asked if i would be able to order and customize them for my parents wedding anniversary , and of course , they didn ' t hesitate in helping me out ! we were are so impressed with the quality and taste of the cookie , that i can ' t wait for my next get together to have an excuse to order more ! allison and dana , you really helped me turn my family ' s get together in to something really special , thank you ! 
i went there with few of my friends on sunday . i ' d heard about this place from my one of my client that i couldn ' t wait to check it out . when we arrived the place , luckily we did not need to wait for a table ( it was packed when we leave ) . we order some appetizer , we love crab nachos . the toppings are great . plus serve with the mixer drinks . we really enjoy it . i order the margarita , lemon favor ( i think it old fashion margarita ) it came with a big round glass i loved it . at first we were not sure what kind of crab we should order . then our waitress , jennifer recommend us try the mix steam crab dady feast and after that we went for the Nnd round for king crab . we love it . the place is comfortable , service is good , food is great and the drink is excellent for dinner . we all like it . definitely , we will come back . 
the food ( especially the red onion sandwich ) is delicious , if a little overpriced . however , the employees are rude , unkempt unshowered , snotty hipsters who never smile and are often so high as to need the order repeated . seriously , fire them , and you ' d get better ratings ( i ' m clearly not the only person who thinks this ) and much more business . 
fantastic concept ! delicious food the best cappuccino in the city . the downside is the crowd of tourists that always flock to the place , best to go during off hours , lunchtime is overpacked . 
very good but hectic . maybe too much of a scene to appreciate the food . we had two decent appetizers , very nicely done but nothing spectacular . the entree was delicious . beautifully sauteed arctic char in a polenta-ish corn meal with string beans . desert also delicious , a peach cobbler with peaches that tasted like peaches and a baked crust that almost tasted like shortbread cookies . the scoop of pistachio ice cream that accompanied it was pushing it a bit . i think i might have preferred a boring vanilla to go with the beautifully cooked cobbler . again , very good food but i ' m only beginning to appreciate it now in retrospect . when i was in the restaurant i felt a bit strained and pushed even though the wait staff and the hosts were all as accommodating as can be . i think i prefer " five points " where the scene is a bit more subdued and you can actually concentrate on your food and dinner companions . 
what an awful experience my wife and i had at this restaurant . we had an baptism dinner for our son held there and while arranging everything we were sweet talked by the owner that he was going to take care of us and that he will be on the premise making sure everything is running smoothly . he also told use that the place could easily hold N guests and a maximum of N , we only had N and that was way too much ! ! ! ! nobody had any where to move ! ! ! the day before the event the owner let us know that he would not be there because he had his daughters birthday party . i ' m sure he knew way in advanced and didn ' t want to tell us in fear that he would lose our business . he only supplied with one waitress and one bartender for a party of N ! i had to help serve the food instead of enjoying myself . the staff had no clue to any of the arrangements that we had made with the owner because he forgot to relay that information to them so now instead of helping guests they were constantly on the phone with the owner because they didn ' t know how to handle situations . midway through the party the food ran out ! ! ! ! the guests were asking if they were going to bring out more trays ! most importantly , his bartender spilled a whole glass of red wine on my wife ' s dress , which was an accident but we didn ' t even get an apology from anyone . bottom line , he is a smooth talker but not a man of his words . will never do business there again . 
obsessed ! ! scrumptious dinner ! ! went to char no . N on a recent friday night , and had a great time and a fantastic dinner . can ' t rave enough about this place . the staff is wonderfully helpful ( the bartender even put me on to an delicious house whiskey cocktail that puts a N N to shame ) , the service attentive and the menu delicious . it ' s definitely not a vegetarian lover ' s dream here , as most dishes are pork , bacon and generally meat-based . for my next visit i may even skip the apps to make sure i fully enjoy the entrees without overstuffing . i highly recommend the grilled scallops , the side of baked cauliflower and almonds as well as the skirt steak . the overall atmosphere is chill and fun for a couple or for a night with a few friends - and from what i peeked , looks like they ' ll be opening a garden in the coming months . if you happen to be in boerum hill stop by for a cocktail and stay for dinner ! 
you do not come here for the ambiance . it ' s just one of those places where you can get a great burger , but make sure to ask for extra napkins b c they ' re so juicy that they drip . 
cisco is the best ! no elaboration needed . 
i have been going to this place for years when i get the chance . its a great place to eat . its just unique enough that it makes it worth the trip . i have tried a lot on the menu but my all time favorite is the ants on a tree . i def recommend . priced fair , casual , and consistently good food and service . 
it sucks when your favorite restaurant of all time starts to go downhill . i still love this place , still love the food and the down to earth service . but the prices have been going up over the past couple of years , while the food quality and portion size has been going down just a tiny bit . the bread that comes with the table is definitely not the fresh soft bread i remember . i still give it N stars and will continue to come here but am now on the lookout for this decade ' s favorite cafe . 
t and i tried this place on monday afternoon during our president ' s day foray into the city . we started with the miso soup which was salty and fishy and everything miso soup should be . we then had the avocado salad . i ' m not usually a fan of ginger dressing but this one was really good and i loved the fresh slices of avocado on top . for our main course we had crunchy spicy tuna roll , eel and avocado roll , philly roll and a monkey roll . i didn ' t try the eel but the others were all very well made and tasty , particularly the monkey roll . i love the smoked salmon . however , i thought the rolls were a little small for the prices . i loved the atmosphere at zento , particularly the back room with the two story ceiling and the rustic chandelier . our server was really sweet and i think i ' d like to go back for dinner to get a different , more romantic " vibe " from this place . 
this place is really hospitable . we had to wait in line for a table , which wasn ' t too bad because during the wait , they came by twice , once with cookies to snack on , and once with orange slices . they also gave everyone a glass of water . i got the steak and eggs . the ribeye was great and cooked exactly like i ordered it , medium . the eggs were good . i also made the mistake of ordering a side of bacon . i say mistake because i thought it would have two or three pieces of bacon , not the N-N they brought out . while we were eating they came by with orange slices again . i also got a chocolate egg cream soda , which was really good . my food was really good , definitely worth N stars . my wife got the chicken chipotle omelette which is what i would get next time , simply because it is something i can ' t get anywhere else . my wife loved it , but couldn ' t finish it because of the large portion . i saw at another table someone got eggs florentine which i almost got because it looked so good . the waiter also gave us a cherry limeade on the house , which was also worth ordering . the service was great , my coffee cup was always full . we can ' t wait to come here again . 
amazing cheesesteaks . service is good too . everyone is very very nice , you always feel welcomed , especially when the owner calls you sweet names like ' sugar ' or ' cutie ' . makes me giggle and feel warm inside . overall , dig this spot . good food . prices normal . check this out when your in the area . 
sashimi was not fresh . tasted like it had been frozen . watery and tough . first time i had to return my meal anywhere . lots of construction going on in the strip mall perhaps they are not busy enough . sashimi lunch here is N and no salad . all around poor choice . not returning . 
so we decided to have brunch sunday afternoon , we get to tom ' s and we ended up having to wait for a table , i ' d say about N minutes ? ? the food wasn ' t as good as i thought it was going to be , the hostess offered us hot coffee and cookies ( stay away from the cookies ) once we got our food i was unimpressed by my N cheeses omlette that only had american cheese in it was overcooked . others ordered pancakes bacon the typical stuff , but the crabcakes w chipolte mayo were awsome . i won ' t hurry back anytime soon . 
the food is hit or miss . some items are really good . some just so-so . the spaghetti pomodoro was very bland . the calamari was tough . but the worst part is the surly waiter we get every time we go there . he has the worst attitude , like he ' s doing you a big favor . also , the lighting is bad - way too bright for dinner . 
great dessert the apple pie ravioli with maple walnut ice cream . the pasta ' is made of very thinly sliced apples , stuffed with apple pie filling . the maple walnut ice cream is served on a great short bread . very innovative . loved it . 
food and service were wonderful . jane was packed with people waiting outside on a damp , dreary day . my wife and older daughter were with me . we all really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere . great job jane ! obviously our reservation helped . 
this place is amazing this is the second time i had went to this place . i have to say i have never been to a restaurant with the service as well as this place . the treat you like a king they wanted through the menu if you need any help taking recommendations . and the food is amazing as well take great looks great and also smells great . if you ever want to take anybody out on anniversary birthday or anything like that this is the place to go . 
this has been a much needed and much welcomed addition to the neighborhood . it ' s in a good location ( still part of the downtown area ) and easily accessible . i had been eagerly looking forward to it since i had heard about it a few months ago and must say that i went in with high expectations . even with that in mind , i left knowing i ' ll be back . the location might not be the biggest , but there are quite a few tables and all were full and turned over while we were there . . . definitely a good sign . the food was very good . their menu provides a good range of options from appetizers to entrees to sandwiches so you really can ' t go wrong . the food was flavorful and plentiful as well as affordable . i had the beef and lamb shawerma which was very filling . everyone at the table ordered something different and everyone agreed that it was a good pick for dinner . we started with a few appetizers which all were nice and light and refreshing . the only negative culinary experience was the turkish coffee . it just tasted off and not quite as good as any other turkish coffee i ' ve ever had . as others have mentioned the service is in-consistent . ours was quick and speedy , although with a few hiccups . quite honestly you can see that its all because the restaurant just opened and its going through its growing pains so its nothing to be concerned with . based on their food , this is a definite must-try for the area . 
bravo ! veal marsala and frozen cosmo were excellent ! 
chili lobster was phenomenal . halibut special was the best seafood i ' ve ever had . 
the drinks are good . food is good , can be pricy . 
my hatred for pyt knows no bounds . why the hell would you serve non-vegetarian chips with your veggie burgers ? they suck anyway . my husband hates how greasy his burger has been both times we gotten food from py . for the record , we have heard really bad things about the service and since a N gratuity is automatically added on , we always got takeout . 
i have never been to a restaurant where anyone ( let alone the owner ) would go out of his way for the customer to feel special . my mother and i stopped by on a slow weekday night and by the end of our meal it was raining pretty heavily outside , and han ( the owner ) insisted to take my mother home so she wouldn ' t get stuck in the rain on her walker . its the little things about han dynasty keep me coming back . we ordered the dumplings in chili oil and they were stellar as usual , but were slightly too spicy for my mom so han put together a sweet sauce on the side to go with them ( which i liked even better ) . for the main course han suggested the double cooked pork and garlic sauce shrimp . the long hot peppers that topped the pork belly went wonderfully with the slight sweetness of the dish . the garlic shrimp were great but i ' m not the biggest fan of the mushrooms that came with them . overall the service was good and the food delicious . ive been dragging my coworkers there almost daily to sample the huge lunch menu where every entree offered . for the best chinese food in the city , han dynasty is the only choice . 
eh , i took a friend here for lunch after experiencing their delectable jambon crostinis at an eataly event . unfortunately , i was not impressed . the dishes are incredibly overpriced for their size and flavor -- there are better tapas places in the city for half the price . anyway , we ordered the pumpkin and goat cheese croquettes . tasty , but they would have been more of a dessert if not for the spice and dryness . also had the fried sardines , the pork belly and pork sausage . nothing was memorable -- pork belly was a bit too salty , and the dried sardines i probably could have made myself and just added lemon . best dish was the orange bread pudding . 
this place has the best breakfast going ! lucky for us is was right around the corner from where we were staying , ended up eating here twice while in nyc . the pancakes are to die for , along with their syrup , butter blend . service is great even though its packed . i like that they get your cell number and text you when your table is ready such a great idea instead of standing in a line for an hour . 
best pancakes in the city of new haven . 
whenever i am in the remote vicinity of mama ' s i am always tempted to go in and get a falafel . maoz pales in comparison to the tasty , filling , inexpensive yumminess of mama ' s . i think even people who dislike falafel would like mama ' s ! 
we arrived for a dinner on saturday night and restaurant was so busy even though , they served the best food and service was on time . that ' s the really a good thing i liked about it . definitely some of the best platter and roll i had . the all ingredient in platter speaks for itself . . i kept eating it . . so fresh . . and fair price . . 
didn ' t like the place at all ! ! ! ! ! the food was nasty . my mac and cheese looked like soup . all i can say is that the chicken was decent , but too much grease . you can say its more of a hang out spot than a actual resturant to go out on a date or something like that . its more like southern fast food . 
went for a dinner with my boyfriend . lovely atmosphere , food is great , oysters were delicious ! wish the menu would be a little more broad . service wasn ' t bad either , while i went to the bathroom the waitress handed the check with a " call me " note to my boyfriend ) that was definitely very " friendly " and bold of her . unfortunately there was no phone number , and we couldn ' t see her to say bye at the end . . . can ' t give N stars , since this " call me " situation wasn ' t cleared up . be careful ladies when you leave your men alone in this place , apparently some waitresses are good not only in selling the food . lol
we arrived ten minutes earlier for our reservation . the hostess politely told us that our private tatami room would be ready shortly because the previous party was just over . it is a very clean and pretty room . whenever there is a party of ten people , i always reserve the tatami room which can keep our children safe and our privacy . since we don ' t eat shell fish , they always do something special for us . we really appreciate their consideration to make our rolls without shrimp or crab even though sometimes we forget to mention it to the waitress . the owner knows our names and she welcomes every customer with a smile . super boat for N is a good portion for us . you can pick your own five special rolls . it is a piece of art and so yummy too . love this place and we feel lucky that nori is so close to us ! 
this little hole in the wall is the best . no liquor license but you can sit across the street at the local bar and have the hostess come over when your table is ready , what a treat . do not miss the grilled octopus it ' s the best i ever had and i ' ve had it just about everywhere . fabulous grilled whole fish , the pompano happens to be my favorite . and the greek salad is wonderful also . if you love fish , the bluefish , greek style will fit your bill . be patient . . . because the wait is worth it . enjoy ! ! ! 
other than the wait for a table and volume of people , the place is solid . the dynamite shrimp is really good- my favorite there . service is just ok , but give them the benefit of the doubt since it ' s always busy . . 
first time making a restaurant rec on yelp ! we went to shehrazad ' s this evening with a friend . had felafel ( with a slight delicious zest ) , extremely moist and flavorful chicken kabobs , a plump spinach pie brimming over with filling and the best baklava i ' ve had in a long time . ( it is a small place where you sit at a counter or at one N-person table . or you can do take-out . or you can take your food next door to his hookah bar , N nights hookah bar . ) extremely good value . the owner , george , is lebanese and you feel like you ' re his guests and you ' ve haven ' t felt as welcomed , as well-fed , and as comfortable for a long time . he gave us a tour of both establishments , pointing out his " kitchen " ( the restaurant ) his " living room " ( the front room of the hookah bar ) and his " salon " ( the cosy back room of the hookah bar ) . stop by , and say hello to george for me ! 
amazing food , not well known , expect to wait a while even late at night . seems like people who know japanese food go there . 
i get the pork soup dumplings , often . yum . the shanghai noodle soup with veggies was good too . service is nothing special but i ' ve never been left waiting long for anything . you will have to ask for refills on tea , generally - but at least the tea is free and they bring you the first one without asking ( as it should be in a real asian restaurant ! ) . good prices . if they could make things cleaner ( the dishes i ' ve gotten were always dirty ) , i ' d give N stars . 
everythjng had a home-cooked feel to it . i tried the half chickens as well as the chicken burger , and everything was delicious . try the garlic mashed potatoes as a side dont forget the brownie afterwards
i really tried to like di fara ' s . N . did i mind traveling from bensonhurst to midwood where parking and traffic was terrible ? no . N . did i mind the rude customer service ? no . N . did i mind waiting over N minutes for my pie ? no . N . did i mind being skipped by N other customers who came after me ? no . N . did i mind that the pie was pretty burnt ? no . N . did i mind that the slices were so oily that it dripped oil all over ? no . i read the yelp reviews on di fara and i braced myself . i thought the pizza would make up for everything we went through to get a pie from di fara but i was very wrong . maybe we went for pizza on his bad day ? the pizza was super salty . so salty that it was inedible . after taking N bites from a slice of pizza , we didn ' t want to finish it . my opinion ? not worth N per slice . not worth the hassle . 
last sunday , three of my friends and i were hoping to get an early boozy brunch in and when we saw that this place opens at like N am for brunch we figured why not ! my one friend got a simple egg , meat , and toast platter while two of my other friends and myself got the healthy eggs benedict . not gonna lie , i almost defeated the healthy part and ordered a side of hollondaise on the side for me to slather my plate in . however , i kept it healthy . the dish arrived with two slices of wheat toast , two poached ( but slightly overcooked aka hard yolks ) eggs , and a salad that def did not skimp on the avocado and goat cheese . we were all very happy . but enough about that boring stuff . let ' s talk about the star of the show . the night before we went , being the fatty that i am , i was reading reviews to see what i was gonna get for breakfast . some random blogger had mentioned apple cider donuts . i pretty much stopped reading the rest of her review once i laid my eyes on those three glorious words . so , when looking at the menu i didn ' t see them on there and went ahead and asked our waitress . she was the best and brought us four donuts as our breakfast appetizer . aaaaaand then as we were leaving we asked for four donuts to go . not only did she package them up all nice , but she gave us an extra donut and gave us that round on the house . my day was made . please , i am urging you to drop in and simply order all of the donuts they have in stock ( made fresh daily ! ! ! ) . then , take them in all their doughy , delicious , fried , sugary , cinnamony glory and walk to the nearest park and just be happy and fat while stufing your face with these bad boys . at N a piece , i say a minimum of N ( per person ) should suffice . you ' re welcome . 
we were excited to try lucky lou ' s after the other tavern that used to be there closed , however we were disappointed that it is the same crap service with a new name . it took entirely too long to get our first beers , and on a friday night , first beers are very important . the menu is large , but the quality is pretty poor . for a spot with a bunch of burgers on the menu the fries should have been better . they were with out a doubt frozen . the calamari appetizer was also frozen , and the fish was mush . the flavors aren ' t bad , but the frozen and pre-prepped quality really shows in a bad light . the main issue is the slow , slow service , i don ' t mind waiting for a great product , but we waited for a poor product . we will not be going back , there are way to many good burger joints bars in the area to waste our time here . disappoint . 
this place is closed . no warning , no signs , no phones , no website . disappeared into the night , like skulking rats . . . . . . . . . . . . . not a way to run a business . they had been hawking gift cerrtificates on several sites . i wonder how many folks got screwed ? i wonder who the proprietors are ? i would like to know if there is another " new " restaurant to avoid . 
the pizza is good , all right ? but there should be a separate rating system on yelp to denote when something is just too overrated . the pizza certainly deserves its four stars , but the experience of the place takes it down a notch . main thing being that you ' ll wait forever with tourist families and over-zealous pizza religiosos to get in . if you come at the wrong time in the afternoon ( think you ' re smart , eh ? ) then you ' ll catch the N-hour downtime of the coal oven cleaning and you ' ll sit there without any table service ( and be lucky you ' re sitting ! people are just standing around outside rain or shine ! ) . you know what ? there ' s enough amazing pizza in this city to spare your family the hours of annoyance and just go get yourself a slice at any of the other fantastic N star places -- dad will be grateful , mom will be grateful that dad ' s grateful , the kids couldn ' t care less , and grandpa wasn ' t going to understand anyway . 
the question when you giro philly is pats or geno ' s cheesesteaks . . . me and a buddy got a footlong from pats and footlong from geno ' s and split them . . . after trying both , we both agreed pats was far better than geno ' s . . . it honestly didn ' t even come close . . . pats was juicy , geno ' s was kinda dry . . . 
i used to work on union square N years ago and i always ate at dos toros ! ! since then i have been schlepping to dos toros for lunch from all corners of the city . it ' s worth it ! ! 
pretentious . . . over priced . . . tourist trap . . . servers with attitude . . . and really long wait times . . and they have forgotten the golden rule- your customer comes first ! manager apologizes for errors , but offers nothing to make up for it . N dollars a buger . . . go to umami instead . btw , if you turn up at Npm to reserve for Npm , there ' s still a N min wait in the rain when Npm appears . 
the food here was good , not a big menu but some good items on there . the small plates tapas arent vrry good amd a little pricey . i would go back for the food , but the service was really slow and took forever even to refill the water . the atmosphere was nice , more for a date than for a group . 
this place is why i love living in brooklyn . . . especially on sunday afternoons with my boyfriend . 
love the paella oysters
this is one of the best not-so-kept secrets in the city . all i can say is you must get the spinach gnocchi if you come here or else you will be jealous of your friends who did order it . their wine selection is great too . went here for my birthday in january , last weekend when my parents were in town and will definitely be going back again soon . great in the summer when you can sit outside and pretend that you are in italy at a sidewalk cafe with a peroni . 
tacky . faux japanese . why even three stars ? because we ' re talking about ramen . noodles and broth . and me spouting off about the inauthenticity of a ramen restaurant in new york compared to the ramen shops in japan is essentially the same thing as saying olive garden isn ' t really ( air quotes ) italy . positives the pork buns are perfect . i prefer the atmosphere at momofuku but the noodle broth is far superior at ippudo . there is this nifty phone number waitlist thing , also a full bar . but . and there is definitely a but . two thirds of the staff , one third of the customers , none of them have any idea what they are doing . case in point my friend and i were seated at one of their communal tables last week- we then suffered through the rural accent of the man across from us as he cockishly ( new word ! ) spat out statements to his suspiciously attractive date such as " due yew know wat oh-maaa-kaah-saaaay iz " while speaking of his recent visit to " sushee gary " . eye rolls , please . yes , he really talked like that . yes , it made my ramen taste like shit . yes , that coupled with the crap service from the corn-fed middle-america non-japanese pretend-japanese-speaking server made me really , really , reallllly re-evaluate my affection for the pork buns , broth , nifty phone number waitlist and full bar . fine print i lived in japan and am thus insufferable when it comes to japanese establishments . also , i ' m just insufferable . 
always make it a point to stop in when i am in burlington and never disappointed . their rolls are creative and the quality of their fish is very fresh . not much to look at from the outside , but go in you will not be disappointed ! 
the fam and i were on a spring break trip to philly , and all during the N hour car ride , i was salivating over this place . being deprived of good chinese food , let alone hand drawn noodles where we live , this was a must stop for us , and we were not disappointed . we all ordered a bowl of hand drawn noodles . brisket , lamb , beef , and fishball . they came out blazingly fast , and piping hot . the brisket and beef were supremely tender , the lamb was good and all servings were large . the bowls were brimming and they didn ' t skimp on noodles , veggies or meat . the biggest and best surprise though . . . ? the N fishballs were larger than golf balls and were stuffed with a meat mixture . completely unexpected but oh so good . we have never had stuffed fishballs before , not even in la . midway through , we decided to order a plate of spicy pig ears . the man and the picky kid would have nothing to do with them , but it was a sheer mother-daughter bonding moment as the two of us scarfed them down . they were sliced a little thin , but the portion size made up for that . they came served on top of a mound of pickled daikon and carrots . we were stuffed , and the bill for the N of us came out to be less than N ( cash only ) . we rolled out of there fat and happy , right into the boba and bakery place a couple of stores down . such gluttons , i know . . . but we were on vacation . 
what else is there to say ? ! besides the boring decor and loud waiters asking " how many ? " ( as in guests waiting to be seated ) , this place is among the best chinese food restaurants in nycs chinatown . service is quick and food comes in an instant ! so if you ' re looking for excellent meats , noodles , and rice dishes and want to spend less , big wong king reigns supreme ! 
my wife and i have been eating at park and orchard for over twenty years . while my wife has sampled the menu i have been ordering the chicken parm each and every meal . it is an easy decision each time i walk through the doors . it has become a running joke with whatever other people we dine with in that they automatically know what i am ordering . if you try the chicken parm you will understand why i love it . it is not like traditional chicken parm that so often is overly fried and loses flavor or is greasy . this is a heart healthy meal that is sauteed rather than fried and in flour , not breadcrumbs . the high quality of chicken used to prepare this dish is also a factor . i have traveled extensively over the past two decades and have had chicken parm all over the world yet rate this chicken parm with the best i ' ve ever had . it also comes with a salad that is filling by itself . the owners are friendly and walk through the restaurant conversing with each table while making sure the quality of their dishes consistently meet their high standards . from craig finding the perfect table , to the extensive menu with something for everyone , a wine list to die for and an excellent staff makes park and orchard a wonderful place for a great night out ! did i mention the chicken parm ? 
so i ' ve been meaning to try this place out since i live a few blocks away . i finally went on a wednesday night and have to say i was pleasantly surprised . i ' ve never had " balinese " food before so i asked the friendly waitress for some recommendations . she recommended the beef rendang and caramelized bluefish which both me and my date ordered . the beef was super yummy and the fish was amaze ! seriously , there were so many spices and flavors going on i don ' t think i could pinpoint what i was tasting , but i ( we ) really liked it . oh yeah , we also ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer and we pretty much licked the plate clean . i must say , i am super stoked to have such a gem in my corner of greenpoint because lets be honest , i am sick of the standard selection of chinese sushi deli sandwiches . i ' ll be back selamat pagi ! 
the law in new york , for adding a gratuity , is for parties of N or more . not N . not unsuspecting tourists . not " those " you suspect might not tip . it is not for the guest to be aware that he she can adjust , it is for the servers to be aware that getting stiffed happens once in a while . i think it is terrible that some guests do not tip , but for the most part , servers bartenders receive as many N tips as they do N ones . i came on here to write a so-so review of your place , but felt it more important to comment on michael ' s response to the guest who was offended by the auto-grat . i am shocked that the person in-charge would be admitting to allowing staff to illegally add a gratuity , and making the guest who it happened to feel badly for mentioning it rather than apologizing , and inviting the guest back in . . . . not cool ! 
gave this place another try and regret it . the grandpa pie was completely unseasoned and tasteless . literally crushed tomatoes out of a can and some cheese . the calamari was over salted and the bready coating was full of dried herbs . the marinara dipping sauce was also completely bland . after a slice i was fine . maybe it was a bad day or my bad luck . 
octopi is outstanding . have been twice and everything is on point , looks tastes great . staff is very friendly and helpful . the char no N drink is as good as it gets . also the warm olive dish to start is the perfect first step to a great meal . 
we got extra awesome food at extra low prices , but i could only put up with the crowded chaos for so long before i needed some fresh air . luckily , residents of philly seem to be much better in crowds than bostonians - people actually apologized as they ran into you ! at any rate , i loved coming here as a tourist , but didn ' t want to spend too terribly long here once i had my groceries in tow . 
my friend and i stumbled across this restaurant on a monday night which would explain why such a homey italian spot would be near empty . the staff was charming , matching the warm ambiance as for the food delicate flavor perfection . we started off with the parmagiana di melanzane and the richness of the tomato sauce blended perfectly with the eggplant and even though it ' s only the antipasti , you want just a little bit more . i strongly recommend the cavatelli broccolino as this restaurant has perfected the art of getting food just right . the sausage was so tender i had to force myself not to rush it . this dish does not disappoint . as rich as the meal was , i was sated but not stuffed , which wad a major plus for me . going back for sure ! 
greek lady is definitely my favorite place to go eat on campus . the food is good , cheap , relatively healthy , and there are never any problems with the orders . i especially like the omelettes and french toast for brunch , and the lamb gyro for dinner . i really enjoy the laid-back atmosphere in the restaurant as the service is always very solid and friendly . and the a one guy in particular , george ( always wearing a flyers hat ) is particularly nice and is always down to chat about anything , mostly sports . i would recommend anyone to come enjoy a meal here , talk to the staff , and enjoy the food . 
went on a tuesday night and it was packed ! we sat at the bar and ordered food . it was a bit tight to eat but it worked . the steak tartare toast was really worth ordering , but after that we wished that was all we had . we tried the pumpkin toast which was too much . the mussels were a bit chewy for my taste . the oysters were pretty good though . the shrimp salad was ok , not enough shrimp . dessert was really great . . . order the carrot cake ! we only had wine , which was ok . . very short list . but i guess their specialty is the mixology drinks , very interesting watching the bartenders mix them up . i liked the ambiance though , and the decor . i would meet up for drinks here with friends . 
great place , fresh sushi
a group of us came here on easter sunday and we sat in the bar area . i had heard good things about this place , so i was hopeful . our server was attentive and accommodating . though , i found it a little awkward that a whole bunch of servers just seemed to always congregate around the back area to wait for something to happen . i felt a little watched , but the restaurant could have just been overstaffed for the holiday , who knows . i ordered the crispy kale salad with bacon and fried egg that was good , though the salt level was a little much . my husband ordered the blueberry pancakes , which were raw , which is prompting this N star review . we never send back food , but the edges of the pancakes were clearly not cooked . he cut into the pancakes and just saw rawness . we had them recooked , and they were fine . my sister ordered the egg ' s benedict . conceptually , it was inspiring , but difficult to eat because the toast , instead of the english muffin , was difficult to get through . i feel this place could be really good , but just needs a little more finesse . 
ippudo is an incredibly trendy joint requiring an average of a N-hr-wait on any given day for dinner . but it ' s well worth it , if only to taste the delicious pork buns ( N a piece but quite small ) , which i believe you can order by the bar while you wait . they were the best pork buns i ' ve ever had . the ramen is good and flavorful but is it worth waiting in line for N hours and paying N per dish ? maybe not but i ' d go back any day for those buns ! 
you definitely get your money ' s worth here and what you are getting is absolutely delicious . it ' s a little hectic when its busy but overall great food and friendly staff . it may be obvious by the name but the hummus is the best i ' ve had . 
talk about inflexible . i ordered the squash flowers sandwich and asked if they could hold the aioli . the waitress gave me what can only be described as a death stare and informed me that they can not change the contents of the sandwiches under any circumstances , though she could ask for us ( reluctantly - was that fear in her eyes . . . ? ) so , you ' re telling me that this not-inexpensive establishment does not make their sandwiches fresh ? that they ' re all pre-made and are sitting there for goodness knows how long before being served to a customer ? i see . . . after much huffing and puffing she returned to us and said that yes , they could hold the aioli . as a very special favor . i then ( recklessly ! ) wondered if they could get the mozzarella in the sandwich to be melted at all ( not unreasonable ? ? everywhere can do that ! takes less than a minute ! ) and before i ' d even finished the sentence , she was practically exploding . . . " i already got them to hold the aioli , i cannot do any more , are you kidding me , what is this insanity , are you out of your freaking mind ? ! ! " or words to that effect . . . " i take it that ' s a no then ? " inquired i , mildly . she seemed on the verge of a coronary . rather than put her at mortal risk with any further outrage , we opted to leave at that point . my god , what are you guys doing to that poor lady ? ? talk about a high-stress environment ! seriously , i was worried ! ! despite this somewhat hair-raising experience , we did actually return shortly after with another friend ( having eaten somewhere else - half the price and no drama ! ) , just to order a few drinks . they looked tasty ( especially the range of bitters and sodas ! ) . our friend ordered an iced tea . oh no , thought i , as that familiar harassed look spread over the lady ' s face . . . . " no iced tea , we ' re all out ! " " oh , ok , said friend , unfazed . " i ' ll have an iced coffee then . " i don ' t think we have any iced coffee either , though i can check for you . . . " we gave up . black tree , you ' re a joke . and ( judging by the pressure you put your servers under ) not a funny one either . 
if you like tomato paste and gross over cooked oregano filled pizza then kens is the place for you . i prefer heating up a slice of frozen elios to this place . the bar keep was an a- hole . he reminded me of a boston bouncer that thinks he is so cool because he has some sort of control . second time i ' ve been to this place ( first time for one drink , but a different jerk at the bar ) . how do they afford such a great location ? horrible place in my opinion
my favorite chinese place ! it ' s been a little different with new owners that took over but it ' s still great ! ! 
great food , excelent service , lots of character . i ' ll go back when i can . 
great new years eve menu . outstanding food . festive ambiance with a lot of candles and flowers and little christmas lights . excellent service . all in all , a wonderful meal in a beautiful setting with great service from the waitress , hostess , and mixologist . 
hi everyone ! so we headed here about Npm and the wait in line for dinner was about N min . so if you come here super hungry you might want to grab a little snack to help hold you off until you get seated . oh and it gets kind of tight in the waiting area . for my Nst time going to this place i was pretty satisfied . of course i went here to try their soup dumplings that they are known for and everyone seems to talk about . i wanted to see if it was actually as good as people have been saying . and i have to say i wasn ' t let down . we had gotten the crab and pork ones and we ate every single one ! they came out hot with the steam coming out of the bamboo container w a soy mixture on the side . you bite into them and the broth just bursts into your mouth . they must be popular because before we were even able get settled into our seats , the waiter was already asking us which dumplings we wanted to order . Nst tip ! - you got to eat them while they ' re hot , because as soon as they start to get hot the broth inside them starts to get thick and its not as great . Nnd tip - watch your shirt ! lol we also ordered the spicy eggplant with pork and the beef tendon soup . which were both pretty typical but i liked the eggplant dish more than the soup . a must try in chinatown for soup dumplings ! 
i had lunch here with two friends . i had a steak salad that was one of their specials today . it was very good . my friends have gone here a few times and recommended the burgers and beef . i will go back when in this area again . there is a great bar and a lot of hd tv ' s for sports viewing . they tell me it is a great hang out after work . 
top notch pizza . 
our son recommended this restaurant and it is simply great . the grilled cheese and tomatoes was delish and my husband had an omelette which he said was equally delish . the restaurant had a nice european feel . coffee was good , and the service very pleasant . it ' s a nice local place . 
you can not go wrong at rita ' s . the food is delicious and the price is wright . the feel is old school and so warm . want the ultimate experience ? show up any day during the week around N Npm - the place is almost empty . sit at the bar , order your favorite dish , glass of vine and . . . just soak it all in . i promise you will do it again , and again , and again . . . 
food and drinks were great . prices reasonable . service was friendly . i will certainly be back ! 
veggie and chicken tacos are just as good as fish tacos . 
my friends and i were here the past week for restaurant week and we loved it ! i had the -zucchini , arugula pecorino insalata for an appetizer ( good if you are a fan of arugula ) - sweet corn agnolotti for the entr e ( delicious ) -pistachio cake with macerated berries for dessert ( my favorite part of the experience ) my friend had the tartufo and it is a must have if you decide to go . we had reservations for N N and were seated as soon as we arrived even though we were fifteen minutes early . the staff was really friendly and the food was incredible . i would definitely recommend this to everyone i know . 
the food at think grill is fantastic -- especially their specialty dessert crepes . but the best part of think grill is the staff . during hurricane sandy when most of the neighborhood lost its power for an extended period of time , the think staff allowed me ( and several others ) to set up shop in their place . it was my little greek office for a few days and during the entire time they were incredibly hospitable -- even allowing us to come in before they opened ! it will be my go-to place from now on . 
i went to butcher bar recently , they are good because they give you the choice to arrange your own platter . i have a lot of food allergies but they were pretty nice and helpful to me . their pulled pork is amazing , no msg ! i am going back . 
pyt definitely has a lot of variety i ' ll give them that but the food here is just medicore . ordered a pyt burger and yes it was juicy but it lacked flavor . they put way too much mayo on the pyt burger . . it was literally going all over the place ( it actually didn ' t even say on the menu there was mayo ) . the waffle fries that came with the burgers were at least decent but still not worth the N . the service here is subpar - it ' s slow and our waiter was not attentive at all . he pretty much just took our order and gave us our food and that was it . we had to get up to get the check and pay . bathrooms here are pretty disgusting . there is also only one co-ed bathroom with multiple stalls which can be a bit uncomfortable for some . don ' t think i ' ll be coming back . 
this was the nastiest pizza i ' ve ever had . and i grew up here eating slices from some shady af dollar places . our tomato basil pie was straight up dripping in oil and not in the good , nyc blot it out with a napkin kinda way . to top it off , it was mad expensive ! this is what i get for being desperate for pizza in times square . . . smh , never again ! ! ! 
favorite place for a margarita in the whole city ! happy hour is great . half off pitchers and trust me you only need one . the chips and salsa are only N ! can ' t beat it . the staff is super friendly . perfect area next to the piazza with outdoor seating . if you want a place to grab drinks after work or on the weekend , this is the place ! great place for both mexican and bbq . if you ' re in philly , don ' t miss this place ! 
love ants pants ! it can be super busy on the weekends and you can end up sitting like right next to someone but it ' s worth it . food is always good , coffee is always great ( get a latte , there usually is latte art ) and the waiter is super friendly and makes sure you ' re taken good care off . see you again soon ants ! 
joey is awesome . the food is great as well . i realllly enjoyed the pad thai and spring rolls . the restaurant has recently been renovated and makes the whole experience even more enjoyable . 
food and drink here tonight was great--had a decadent meal with the N vegetable plate and rillette and all was homey , rich and well-executed , as the food around me also appeared to be ( burgers w shoestring fries looked yummy and popular ) but this is largely a shout out for the upstairs bartender , alex , who does a fab job--both as a craftsman and a host . was traveling alone and had high recommendation from a very picky sibling that this was ' must do ' so made a special trip here to eat dinner on my last night in nyc . laid back vibe here but crowded which meant no tables so headed up to the Nnd floor bar . not only did alex make me two of the best ' spot on ' cocktails i ' ve ever had , he steered me to the perfect ipa and was very helpful in ordering dinner ( as well as eating it , since he gave me a tip to mix the rillette so i didn ' t get a mouthful of duck fat instead of pate ) clearly , he cares about has a passion for his work and i also observed him to take care of other parties around me in the same way and going the extra mile to give customers just what they wanted--even when that took quite awhile to tease out of them . i had a fabulous dinner where i felt relaxed and personally attended to ( thx for the history lesson about chartreuse btw ! ) despite dropping in on a very busy sunday night . i even left with the exact recipe for my favorite drink--yay ! alex is a real gentleman and great at what he does--bravo to him and know that the bar upstairs is a fine place--perhaps even the best place--to spend your evening here . 
the worst food i have had in ages ! ! ! the halal carts on the street corners have a better gyro or shwarma then this hole . my co-worker and i got a lamb gyro for lunch and we were sick all afternoon . the bread is hard as a rock and cracks so u can break your teeth . 
fuji mountain did an outstanding job hosting a party this past weekend for my wife ' s Nth birthday . we ' d booked a few months in advance and a short meeting with the manager sean set us up for success . sean hit all the right notes on menu selection and attention to our group . the karaoke room was exactly the right size for our group of N , with great lighting and a dedicated bar -- and terrific bartenders ! for the fixed price we negotiated for the party , sean absolutely buried us in food -- two enormous sushi boats , negimaki , teriyaki , tempura , gyoza , you name it , we had it -- and was ready with delicious vegetarian options too if we needed them . ( although another reviewer didn ' t like the calamari rings , i actually really loved them , but as with everything , it ' s a matter of preference . ) i will definitely recommend fuji mountain to anyone looking to host a karaoke party . we ' d looked at another restaurant ( rhymes with hockey story boy ) which quoted us prices literally double fuji mountain ' s , and are very happy with the experience . thanks to the fm staff for a terrific night ! 
hello ramen ! im a ramen fan and i am an even bigger ramen and pork bun fan . there are so many types of great ramen on the menu . the only part i dont like about the place is that they dont take reservations and the wait is usually very long . if i werent for that , i would give them N stars . 
omg . was fairly empty around brunch time on a saturday morning . looked nice . we ordered our food and were p . hopeful . but then it took almost N minutes for our food to come . and it was cold . my girf ordered the big breakfast ( which comes with eggs ) and they forgot the eggs ! can u believe it ? ! her hashbrown patty was crusty and hard . . . tbh it was basically inedible . they only put literally two bites of beans on the plate and the bacon was super wimpy and pathetic . also overcooked . also the restaurant crew kept playing music but they kept skipping to different songs before any song was able to play the whole way through . really didn ' t help out the vibe of the restaurant . signing off
went a second time tonight , after an early movie . . really love it . friendly service , would love to eat it all but there is only so much room in my tummy ! ! ! spreading the word on my fb page . considering catering at some point . i am a big fan ! 
we came here for the first time tonight after a friend ' s recommendation . the menu is very limited , but the food sure taste good ! service is excellent , and the price is very reasonable . will definitely visit again . 
when someone suggested belgium the biggest export comes to mind . . . muscles from brussels . even at N . . . . sorry i digress . . okay , belgium waffles , belgium beers and asterix . oh , of course mussels and frites ! this cavernous restaurant in chelsea on a quiet street was our destination for tonight ' s dinner . casual ambiance . comfortable interior that is easy for conversation with friendly service . to start . bone marrow with toast . delicious . of course you know what i ordered right ? of course you do and in a provencal broth too boot ! the pot was brimming with bivalvia mollusca . the aromatic broth was great for bread dipping . flavorful , nice blend of herbs and seasoned well . bxl provided a great spot for dinner . love . set . match . 
so after many friends have told me that el vez is the place to go for some great " new mexican " food , i decided to take my gf there after a day walking around philly . i was excited because all i heard about el vez was that is a swanky place with refreshing takes of classical mexican food , a hip atmosphere and . . . a photo booth that you can use to remember your experience . anyway , we arrived an hour earlier than our reservation so we had to sit at the bar for about N minutes . during that time , i was able to take a look at the d cor . . . it was pretty hip . it was very refreshing and got me even more excited to enjoy a great meal . my gf got a margareta and i got the sangria . both drinks were made well ( and for N they should be ! ! ! ! ) . anyway , we were seated and here ' s where it went downhill . . . first , we were seated next to a group of N people that were incredibly loud . . . to the point where they were all yelling at each other to talk . as a result , i had to yell to my gf to even be heard and vice-versa . that comes with the territory so we accepted it . my gf turned to me and asked , " baby , do you want to order the guacamole ? " . everyone had been talking about this guacamole like it was the best thing on earth . i said , " sure . . . let ' s go for it . . . " . then she said , " N for guacamole ! ! ! that ' s ridiculous . " i insisted that it was fine , but then she said , " listen , we go out to nice places all of the time and get to eat some great food , but paying N for a bowl of guacamole is just plain absurd . . . i mean , it ' s guacamole ! ! ! ! " . i thought about it for a while and agreed with her so we passed on it . then we had our meals . she got the chicken tacos and i got the carne asada . she absolutely loved her dish . i thought it looked pretentious . it was N mini soft tacos on a long-thin plate . my dish was absolutely the worst dish i have had in quite some time . in a nutshell , the texture was great , but it was seasoned with the most salt i have ever had on a dish . i have never sent anything back to the kitchen , but i came close . i couldn ' t even finish it ( even though i was starving ) . i heard good things about the food at this restaurant and i don ' t know if i came on a bad night , but the meal was almost inedible . . . yeah , it was that bad . i may try the restaurant again , again , the atmosphere was great and the service was great . the food , however , not so much . i ' ve had better luck at tgi fridays . i expected a bit more excellence from a stephen starr restaurant . 
easily the best burgers in all of philly . actually , i ' ve never had a bad meal here . the only problem is that parking is a pain in the ass , but that goes without saying in no libs , and sometimes there ' s a long wait for a table . 
hotter waitresses would be nice - but just stick to the sliders and you ' ll be happy . had angus and lamb and was very please - got N of em . remember comes with fries or salad - salad has awesome balsamic . not packed but only two tvs . good beer selection
i went there with my friends for dinner and i ordered a dish with kebabs . . . as i cut kebab and tasted , it was an ok taste . . . but what i further saw and the end results amazed me . . . kebab was uncooked inside and when i told the waitress owner he look at me and smile . . . when i said i would like to return it . . . he said you already took a bite so you can ' t return it . . . when the bill came out . . they charge me for the dish . . . i talked to the owner about charges . . . he had no explanation . . . i didn ' t care about that i paid . . . owner seems nice but what a stingy prick . . . just from one bite of uncooked food . . . i was in the hospital . . . i haven ' t been back ever since . . . all i ' m saying fellas is that when you eat there or anywhere just make sure their food is cooked . . . all the best ! ! ! i could ' ve easily sue the restaurant , ahh but what the heck . . . 
i found a long hair twice in my food and the coffee is not good at all ! i doubt it ' s just coincedence that it was aweful everytime i ' ve been there . nothing special about the food here , it ' s ordinary breakfast you can get at diners . i ' ve been here a few times because it ' s my bestfriends favorite breakfast spot . the staff is very " standoffish " except for this one young hispanic looking man i ' ve seen seating customers a few times , he seems to be the only one that is able to smile or be polite . i complained once about the hair in my food and not only did they still charge me for it , they were so rude to me as though it was my fault ! i don ' t know if he was just the cook or the owner , but he was so unprofessional yelled at my waitress , she wasn ' t very pleasant to begin with but he ' s the cook , how is it her fault ? ! the hair wasn ' t even her color ! anyway , i believe in second chances which is why i didn ' t write them off immediately but this is too much . yeah , i wont be going back there ! i advise those reading the same , sorry but true . 
pick your way across the menu , sampling bits here and there . everything is packed with flavor . the escalor crudo was oustanding , and the meal never let down from there . l ' artusi is small , has a lively environment , and doesn ' t lack for noise . don ' t expect an intimate environment , but they won ' t let you down on the food . 
wow , i was really looking to this place opening up . butcher bar offers decent bbq for astoria , but that ' s where it ends . after going multiple times i ' ve tried the brisket , burgers , pulled pork , and burnt ends . everything was just ok , but portions are small and the food is expensive for bbq . sure , everything is organic and grass-fed , but i ' m not sure how much of a difference that makes for smoked meat . bottom line it works to satisfy that bbq craving if you aren ' t willing to travel to manhattan . 
this cafe offers great customer service and the cupcakes are very fresh and so is the food . 
i get my lunch from this place and it is always outstanding ! i can tell that they use high quality ingredients and their chefs definitely know what they ' re doing . i joke with friends that i ' d like to stop by the place for cooking lessons . great place ! 
went here for my birthday last year and thought it was very good . the setting in side is really romantic and intimate , lots of exposed brick , which is always good ! the food itself is very good and solid , not the best i ' ve ever had , but still worth it very flavorful . 
okay baby blues bbq . . . i thought that i ' d surprise my elderly southern born and raised mom for her birthday by picking up a pulled pork platter this evening . i was totally disappointed with everything . the pork had two big clumps of soggy skin mixed into pork shredded pork . . . gross . there were clumps of pork that were so thick that they looked like pieces of beef stew . i ' m not kidding , it was bad . no time or effort went into pulling that pork . to make matters worse , the seasonings were severely lacking . the mashed potatoes were a tannish color and spiced with cayenne or some other hot substance , they tasted bad as well . the cole slaw was dry . my mother made me laugh because she said , " there is no way a real southerner cooked this pork . i need to show them how it ' s done . and at N she still can . famous daves has nothing to worry about if this is the quality of bbq baby blues is pushing . 
best pork tacos ever ! 
spacious spot with a homey feel to it . you can come with a large group and sit in the cafeteria style table , or the smaller ones for a more intimate feel . i came in and loved how i could throw my coat and earmuffs up on the coat rack . i had the spicy miso , and it was delicious ! the noodles were al dente , which i didn ' t mind . the tiny pork pieces were good , as were the scallions ( as they always are ) . i wanted to just drink up the entire broth , but i resisted . i liked how it came with a huuge spoon with its own plate to set itself on . mmmmm . i also got the pork buns , but was a bit disappointed . the buns were nice and fresh , but one of the pork buns i ate was just all fat . i had another and that was better . nonetheless , the prices are pretty steep . N for ramen ? this ain ' t momofuku . although , i didn ' t really like the ramen at momofuku . the pork buns were also N , but i would make do with chinatown ' s N . N ones . 
le ptit paris is a great new addition to windsor terrace where we ' ve had precious little in the way of good restaurants . we ' ve been a number of times and the food has been excellent each time . salads are fresh and beautifully presented , meat and fish are all good quality . you ' ll find favorites like moules a la moutarde and steak frite , plus salade nicoise , wines are very good too . prices are much more reasonable than da vincenzo , the previous occupant . the decor isn ' t much , but i wouldn ' t expect that in such a small space . it ' s all very clean and serviceable , the perfect neighborhood restaurant . wait staff is attentive . all in all , a real joy . 
i ' ve been to the elbow room before , but not recently . tonight my dining experience was so disappointing . we chose to go to the elbow room tonight based in past experience and because they have outside seating ! we sat down around N and were able to snag one of the last outside tables on the sidewalk in the shade . the table was in a great spot for people watching and to see all the old cars from the car show however , it was titled and our drinks kept sliding . we were greeted by the waiter with water in tow . he came back shortly after to get our drink orders and then our food order . the drinks didn ' t come right away but that was ok since we had water . when he finally brought our drinks ( my husbands beer in a can with no glass ) he said our appetizers would be out shortly . after about N minutes still no appetizers . meanwhile the table across from us had just received their food ( they placed their order when we sat down . . . ) all all of it was cold with hot plates or sitting out for way too long . hmm not looking good . our waiter came back and told us the kitchen lost our ticket and they were scrambling to make our appetizers . . . . shrimp cocktail and wings - not difficult people . i was disappointed with the number of shrimp or lack there of and my husbands wings were not as hot as they could have been and sitting in a pool of grease . as we were finishing up our appetizers when the table behind us asked for a status update on their food and if it wasn ' t ready they wanted to leave . finally our salads came but our table for N was never cleared of our appetizer plates , bread plates , empty glasses or the empty bread basket . it was a challenge to find a place for our salads . . . and after all the wait the salads were blah . i had ordered the nightly special small plate which was a salad . something about the flavors just didn ' t mix well . both my husband and i left unsatisfied and still hungry and at this point we had been there for an hour and half . and to top it all off the staff cleaning the adjacent table spilled cocktail sauce on my new purse . the manager on duty offered me a gift certificate for the trouble , but did she honestly think we would come back again any time soon ? her excuse for the poor experience " well it ' s a nice night , people are out and we are very busy " i understand all this , but that should inspire you to make your services even better , provide hot quality food and not take an hour and half to prepare N appetizers and N mediocre salads . she had no apologies for the grease spot not one or the awful service . so in the words of the manager " if it ' s a nice night and people are out " and they are busy stay away ! ! ! you ' ll be just as disappointed with the food and service as we were . 
great chicken . meal N is what i usually get . N . N
just got a quick take out lunch from margon . cuban sandwich with everything on it was delicious . rice and beans with plantains as well . N bucks . really can ' t beat that around this area . can ' t wait to try other sandwiches and plates . definitely better than sophies and seems to be a lot fresher . will update after trying the other goods soon ! 
i was a bit drunk . we ordered way too much food . . no names , chada . we scared off any table who sat behind us . . . no names , evan . food was nothing special not for nothin , one dish smelt like dirty vag i shit you not , i had chada move it from me . but dude they had that plastic wrap toilet seat cover machine , hehe awesome got a picture of it . . . . and no i wasn ' t sitting on it when i took it you freaks . still dont poop in restaurants . meh you wanna try , try i ' ve had way worse . 
the pancakes are pretty good . but don ' t all come running at once and making the wait outside the restaurant for breakfast N hours long on a weekday morning . 
in europe any place that cooks and serves you balls in various sauces would be put on trial for heresy ! this stanton st institution however does it so well and although evening queues outside can fall into the " load of balls " category too . . it ' s all worth it ! ! a great place to let your taste buds go nuts ! one of the best food joints in this end of nyc . . not pretentious just honest and yummy fare . 
great food . great prices . bring a megaphone so you can talk to your date over the music . for that reason alone , i will only go if i can sit outside . 
happened by the line of people waiting to order their take-out and immediately figured i should stop by and give it a try . glad i did - i got the large lobster bisque which tasted great . and i was surprised to see it came with a loaf of bread and an apple . all for N . N - pretty good deal for midtown ! 
hands down the best thai food i ' ve had in my life . i just got back from thailand this week and wanted to see if i could keep up the delicious eats . sripraphai did not disappoint . i personally found the food here better than in thailand but obviously much more expensive . they also have an outdoor patio which was perfect for the fall weather right now . food - great noodle soups with tasty broth ( we had N versions and all were good . - awesome larb with pork . - they have a ton of pork belly options that are done very well and crispy . the chinese broccoli with crispy pork belly is fantastic . - very solid thai fried rice ( they give a lot of meat ) food was so good i ordered takeaway to eat for dinner . they also have some packaged food for sale . i bought some fried chicken skins to also bring back home . i ' ve got nothing against queens , but this place was pretty far but definitely worth the trip . car service from union square was N bucks to get here . taking the train back to the les took a little over an hour , but i didn ' t mind since i had food coma anyway . it ' s pretty close to the e , r , and m . 
you can ' t stay in business as long as dante ' s without great food and service . add some ambiance , and you have an all around terrific dining experience . dante ' s marinara is the best i ' ve ever tasted . if i could have ordered a bowl of it with some garlic bread , i would . actually , i probably could , but there ' s too many other delicacies i ' d have missed . whatever you order will be perfectly cooked , and the portions are not skimpy like some " northern " italian venues . plan to spend some time here - this is not a meal you ' ll want to rush through . 
spent a wonderful weekend in nyc . this place was great . the food presentation was lovely and the bar as well as the bathrooms were very clean . very much enjoyed the outside bar . i would highly recommend this place and will visit many times over . heather you rock ! the best waitress and very efficient . 
to echo what liana said , ippudo ' s service really blew me away . from the friendliness of the hostesses , the authenticity of the restaurant ( a lot of the staff speak japanese ) and the overall attention to detail ( like wiping your table in between courses and explaining your food to you and such ) , it all created a really pleasant environment . sure , the ramen choices are pretty typical and limited in variety , but i actually like the simplicity of the menu . the appetizers actually are pretty cool--we got the pork buns and the prosciutto spring rolls . the pork buns are good , but i really wish they didn ' t just squeeze mayo onto the lettuce ( which to my dismay , was iceberg lettuce ) . they could have really elevated the dish by making it a slaw , or adding more citrusy toppings like pickled veggies and cilantro . the prosciutto spring rolls came with this really interesting sauce of marscapone and balsamic vineagar . such a weird but surprisingly tasty combination of flavors--salty , creamy , tangy , and sweet all at once ! mind blowing . also , the green tea ice cream dessert was da bomb . a must-try . to compare ippudo to toto , here are the main differences - ippudo is more expensive - there are more " fusion " type items on the appetizer list--definitely a more refined place than toto - all the broth is made with pork , whereas toto actually uses chicken broth - a lot more seating in ippudo ( meaning shorter wait time ) - not a lot of toppings offered at ippudo , but toto charges a lot for their toppings i would gladly come back if friends are visiting , just for the experience ! 
i had dinner here last week and was pretty darn happy . i got the burger with the whole deal egg , pineapple etc and it rocked . my buddy got the hanger and was equally stoked . got a good drinks menu and i thought the vibe was super cool , nice staff good tunes and just a good plae to have a good time dinner . i live in manhattan but will def be back over the bridge to visit again . 
the pastrami is consistently excellent , highly recommended . i have been there several times because the food is so good . 
excellent , excellent , excellent . . . . . what more can i say but make every effort to go there and try the pizza . weather it be round or square ( sicilian ) you cannot go wrong . i have been going to l b since the N ' s and it is still the same delicious food . they say pizza was first discovered in naples but i think naples came to brooklyn and is residing at l b spumoni gardens . oh and the spumoni is the tops and you should try the restaurant . you will wait for a table but the long wait will reward you palate . before the hearse drops you off at your final resting place tell the driver you want to stop at l b for your last meal . 
delicious ! chutney mango sauce is beyond yummy . 
was here for restaurant week with another couple . certainly one of the better restaurant week menus because each person gets to choose two small appetizers . in terms of the appetizers , the sausage is delicious and the babaghnoush has a nice smoky flavor and doesn ' t use mayo like a lot of places . the haloumi was nothing special nor was the hummous or bone marrow . for mains i had the duck kebab which was very tasty given the nice fattiness of the meat and would recommend it given the uniqueness of the dish . while the main dish is small ( only one skewer ) the abundance of the appetizers makes up for it . the food price is very reasonable ( alcohol is over priced ) and the ambiance is cool , however it does not warrant a second visit . i would like to add that the lady bartender was unnecessarily rude , as she made a remark to me when i asked her for less ice with my scotch . 
just returned from our first visit to oaxaca kitchen . can ' t wait to return ! really enjoyed the dining room , decor , the attentive waitstaff and the food ! wow . tonight , we shared four appetizers . . . a very delicious lobster enchilda , wonderful flavorful fish tacos , one of the best crab cakes this diner has ever eaten and a fun , fruity ceviche which was the star of the show . four apps was the perfect portion for the two of us the share . the drinks wine also top notch . highly recommended ! 
if you like deep fried hotdogs you must go here . the relish is out of this world and its homemade . if you ' re not into hotdogs though , i wouldn ' t recommend this place . most of their other food isn ' t great , just the hotdogs were good . 
a new yorker who cherishes the staples of the typically overrated new york dining scene should revel in the mediocrity of this food and rudeness of the service . yes , a true new yorker will adore how some dishes are over-salted while others are unbelievably bland ( my dessert was a ghost of a former dessert , haunting my plate with its insipidness and dry texture ) . they will be grateful for the service rushing their entire experience thieving unfinished dishes out from under you , bringing out the next course before the previous is removed , and even removing your water from you to get you to leave after dessert . they have to turn those tables , you know . it ' s new york ! the true new yorker will love convincing themselves aloud in conversation that the food was excellent ( a method to rid their impressionable mind of the unbearable cognitive dissonance such a highly-rated establishment has caused them ) . they will also appreciate spending N in a matter of two hours and being treated as if they had spent N over the course of five hours , because that makes us true new yorkers believe that a restaurant is " important , " like we believe jerks are cool in high school . sarcasm aside , scarpetta is a fetid shit of a restaurant if aesthetics are batman , it is bane . scarpetta is the reagan administration . 
i like the new menu . the ahi tuna appetizer is fantastic but a bit pricey at N . N . the food is good , the burgers and fries exceptional . the music in the bar area was way too loud . luckily a table in the restaurant was available in less than the N minutes that was quoted . my partner had the squash and ravioli and it was very good . i had the brazilian lobster tail special . i wasn ' t impressed by the sauteed spinich . all in all it was an enjoyable meal and we would go back . 
worst experience so far with a philly byob . first time we went , the server practically ordered for us off the special menu . food was just ok and a bit overpriced for a byo . a year later , we decide to give it another shot . first of , they don ' t take reservations for N or less on a saturday night and tell you to " just walk in " . when you get there , half the place is empty but it ' s still N minutes until you can get a table . then , in not so many words , they tell us to " wait outside " in N degree weather because there ' s no waiting area . needless to say , we didn ' t wait outside but instead in a nice warm cab on our way into center city . 
omg i couldn ' t believe it . i was very apprehensive coming here because i have been to the best cuban restaurants in miami . i really wanted a cuban sandwich but it was after N and it was not available to my disappointment . my friend and i ordered the first N chicken dishes ( fricassee and the fried cutlet with mango salsa ) . it was amazing ! ! ! ! ! it was seasoned well and the fricasse was very tender and the fried cutlet was good as well . we ordered empanada for appetizer and that was good as well . btw i am salivating as i am writing this review . . . anyway , i ordered a " cuban iced coffee " and honey for N it was a rip off ! ! ! ! do not get it . i should have ordered a sangria or mojito instead ! 
have been going here for many years , but since they changed chefs a year or so ago it was never the same . boring menu and no taste food . decided to give it another chance last night and very dissappointed . not a special experience as i used to feel . waitress acted like she was on speed pills or something , no focus not attentive . food was bland , had to add a lot of s p , fennel salad was horrible . i have to say the filet mignon was delicious , that ' s the only thing that made the trip even worth it . way over priced for what they have to offer . unfortunately will not go there again . i think it is now more of a bar scene . . . . 
the food was good , but the service was so bad that it was embarrassing for all involved N ) they called me to confirm my reservation after i ' d already been sitting at my table for N minutes N ) they gave me dirty menus , covered in some kind of slime sauce N ) the waitress interrupted my order to tell me she ' d " give me more time " . . . and walked away before i could correct her assumption and give her my order i mean , it was funny , so . . . there ' s that . 
a great find for breakfast in new haven . me and my girlfriend came here this morning and ordered , two eggs style which came with toast and creamy grits . i order a side of maple pork sausage and because we checked in we received a free order of french toast . the food was delicious and our waitress was great . i definitely recommend coming and we will be back soon . 
not worth the money . . . the food at the restaurant was bad . 
i . died . ! ! ! the pizza here is amazing ! nothing more to say . this is my new go to ! 
really good stuff ! chorizo tacos to die for ! 
a favorite for brunch ! ! ! almond hash was fantastic and the condiments they put out with the little bisquits taste deliciously homemade ! also had a company party for N at the holidays and the staff were very accommodating -- a little loud but not so that we couldn ' t enjoy ourselves . excellent ! 
awesome food ! if you can get past the smell of the entire restaurant , the food is really good ! i visited philly with my mom and her friend and they were craving some bbq chinese meats . we saw some hanging through the window and they all looked really decent so went in to give it a shot . walking in , we were met with a wall of stench - it was rather rancid , like N year old gym socks mixed with some rotting stuff . i ' m really surprised we stayed because on a regular basis , we would have hightailed it right out ! it was definitely worth ignoring the stench ( we got used to it after a while ) . the bbq meats were flavorful and very tasty , and all our other entrees were on our top N lists ! they seem to do alot of take out , especially to lots of families and families that order just the bbq meats . we will definitely come here again ! 
this was our go to place for great pastrami and bagels every weekend . but it seems the smartness is leaving this establishment . went on a saturday , walked in N minutes after it opened and they were out of everything bagels and kippered salmon . a jewish deli . . . . seriously ? ! . . . . on a saturday ? ? ? looks like the owner doesn ' t have enough business sense anymore . 
i heart little owl . after unsuccessfully trying to get a dinner reservation for months , we finally decided to stop in for brunch on a lazy sunday afternoon in august . success ! and , wow ! our brunch was phenomenal . our table of two ordered the poached eggs and the salmon w egg on toast . the poached eggs in hollandaise was one of the best benedict ' s i ' ve ever had . food aside , the atmosphere is very understated and endearing . it is a pretty little place . 
another happy hour hangout . their mango margaritas are so strong and delicious . i wish that i could say the same about their food . the nachos and guacamole are passable at best . but they ' re fine as long as they keep those margaritas coming . 
when i worked nearby , this place would be lunch N out of N days . you have to get there before N or else the line starts to build . the jerk chicken is spiced just like they do in jamaica and has got a pretty strong kick to it too . it takes some conditioning not to have your tongue go complete number after the first bite but once you get over it , you can really enjoy the flavor . shes on govorner ' s island on the weekends too , 
the place has character , nice people , and good food . what i would make me go back for is , the date cake . 
i got delivery and decided to change from my normal delivery spot . the sushi was phenomenal , my only complaint was the tempura was cold , which was only because the poor delivery driver had to ride a bike in the cold ! looking forward to actually eating at the location . 
can i give a no star rating ? lets find out . honestly , i cant believe i ' m reviewing this shithole before pats , but here we are , first of all , never go here , ever ! for one thing ( and never forget this ) pats invented the cheese steak and at some point after that genos opened across the street . i have been to both pats and genos and i did always enjoy the og better , plus pats does not burn your fucking retinas in the way genos does . you can argue that being in america , people should speak english , sure , but they dont always and the owners forefathers didnt and maybe in new jersey where that ass lives , everyone does , but in south philly where i live and where lots of mexicans live and where there are a shit ton of tourists from other countries not everyone does , so deal with it . anyway , this place has a cheese steak as lousy as anywhere , and its about as real as mexican food from taco bell . i hope i can keep one philadelphian or tourist from visiting this copycat craphole . turns out , i do have to give at least one star . 
got this little ditty datesat , oct N , N at N N pm subjectyou have a new message mailed-byyelp . com signed-byyelp . com hide details oct N ( N days ago ) hi carlos , el almacen d . has sent you a message on yelp ha " eat the taco truck if you want more ! , the portions in that restaurant are super good ! , and the quality fantastic ! " to reply , click the link below first off , i never complained about the portion sizes , rather the prices . secondly , this arrogant , sarcastic , self-serving response hammers my point across about arrogance . again , " nuff said ! p . s . i have eaten at the " taco truck " as it is only a block away from " el almacen " . and it ' s true ! the " truck " cooks better and has better service ! thanks for the suggestion ! apparentlly , most of the neighborhood agrees as there is always a line at the truck . . . and tumbleweeds elsewhere ! 
yelp success ! we found this one on yelp and never miss an opportunity to grab a hot dog here great job guys your attention to detail is amazing right down to the homemade relish
i ' ve been going to union league caf every year on my anniversary . this year we went an our experience was horrible . we arrived at N N for our reservation which we made a week in advance . when we got inside there was no host at the door but there was the general manager standing at the computer reading a wine magazine . so we approached him and gave our name . he didn ' t even bother looking up from the magazine instead he said someone will be with you momentarily . but instead of saying it in a nice way he gave us an attitude and acted as if we were interrupting him . after about N minutes we asked again and he got angry and said didn ' t i just say that someone will be with you ? the man smelled heavily of alcohol and i could barely understand him with his accent . so we were eventually seated by a small blonde host . when we arrived at our table we didn ' t see our waitress for N minutes and she walked over and asked if we wanted pelligrino or evian and my husband said tap is fine . so she walked away and while we were deciding to what to eat she arrived with our tap water . we placed our order of N green salads and waited about N minutes for them . my husband ordered a steak and i ordered fish . when our entrees arrived to us the fish and the steak was cold like she left it out for N minutes and it cooled . my husband mentioned it and she said with an attitude how she apologizes for the kitchens mistake . the second time around the food was amazing . the young bus boy was very attentive making sure we had bread and water throughout the meal and he cleared very quickly after we finished asking if we enjoyed our meal and saying he was happy that it was delicious . the waitress didn ' t come back for at least N minutes with our dessert menus and then she had an attitude and was very rude . after our desserts were dropped ( by another waiter ) we enjoyed the very decorative sorbet . they looked like little mushrooms . then once again the bus boy came back and was smiling and polite asking us if we enjoyed our meal and my husband joked around with him and they bantered for a moment but even in his obvious youth with his braces and glasses i thought he was much more professional than our waitress . in the end we tipped her N even though she barely deserved N . the food , as always , was exquisite , but our waitress ruined the night for us . i hope next time the service improves . 
wandered past m . o . b . one day and perused the menu , as you do , but found myself saying , " i can eat that , i can eat that , i can eat that , " as a vegan does when perusing the menu , before actually noticing the whole menu is vegan . this is always exciting and i looked forward to a brunch there like crazy . that weekend the service wasn ' t stellar , though the food was . mac and cheese is always a winner and i don ' t need to extoll the awesomeness of it beyond what so many other reviewers already have . the mobs are like baby pizzas cooler than pizzas because instead of being slathered with greasy dairy the airy crunch of the crust carries rich , tasty , roasted veg . all this washed down with a pomegranate somethingoranother cocktail . inspired to go back for dinner we got service that was unwarrantedly exceptional and the food was just as fantastic . a dedicated carnivore friend joined my gal and i at the last minute and was blown away by his meal . so many non-vegetarians non-vegans seem to be surprised when dinner isn ' t simply raw iceberg lettuce and two carrot sticks artfully arranged . m . o . b . is as far from lettuce and carrot sticks as fois gras is from a duck . we ' re lucky to be in a city where vegan food is , if not the norm , easy enough to access for a night out . but it ' s interesting to bear in mind that this place is one of two locations the other is in paris . and the french seem to have something against vegetables , much less vegetarians . so this is one of maybe a couple of dozen veggie restaurants that can make it in one of the meat-lovingest cities there is . . . now that i ' m done writing the review i ' m hungry and i think i ' m going to wander over there for lunch . there ' s still so much on the menu i haven ' t tried . 
a pizza lover ' s dream . for the rest of us , a few hours of wasted time . i really could care less of what pizza company was doing the best in new york N years ago . if you ' re in new york , pretty much every pizza place you walk into is amazing compared to the rest of the world . the tour noted a few places that perhaps are slightly a cut above the rest , but the price also jumps with quality . if you ' re extremely bored and you ' re looking for a somewhat fun day talking about pizza with a guy who really knows his stuff , i guess this is the tour for you . 
we recently had our wedding reception here , and i cannot even begin to say how happy we were from beginning until end . from the first moment we spoke to bobby i felt like i was talking to my brother ! he was extremely honest and helpful when it came to helping us make decisions on food , room , lighting , etc . he was open to all my suggestions and sensitive to any of my concerns . on the day of our wedding ( we had our ceremony and reception here ) , when i walked into the room it truly felt like a fairy tale wedding ! ! the lighting , probably one of my most favorite aspects of the wedding was amazing ! ! countless chandeliers in every color you could imagine ! ! the food was outstanding . when friends and family found out that we were getting married here the first thing they mentioned was the excellent food ! this time was no different . we had a buffet to allow everyone to taste all that they could . the food stations were generously refilled as we gobbled it all up ! ! all of our guests raved about the whole experience ! bobby was available every second of the night ! our cake was no exception to all of the amazement of the night ! delicious ! ! ! i would recommend the appian way for any event , especially if you want a very personalized wedding . thanks bobby . . . . for everything ! ! ! 
trying to get a cheap asian fix ( insert pun here ) ? this would be the place to . as a korean myself , i don ' t think the korean food here is breathtaking or amazing . it ' s great for what it is . . . a quick bite with a small price tag . they have great variety and the ready made lunch boxes are great . pick any of them , they all taste pretty good ! 
bellas is such a gem . everything from omelets to french toast is spectacular . because it is so amazing there is often a wait . . . . totally worth it . do yourself a favor and check out bellas ! ! 
this is the second time i have had brunch here . service was pleasant and the food was very good . 
loved this place ! ! ! ! we are from boston and did not know the area . but it will be our new spot to go when in town . best of all ( well maybe not best because the food was amazing ) you can bring your own wine ! and they do not charge a corking fee . got to love that . 
i ' ve ordered from tuk tuk over the past two years and the food is very tasty . however , after my experience with them last night , i will never eat there again . i called in an order that they got wrong . when i went back to the restaurant to exchange the food for what i did order , i was met with hostility from the manager . she claimed it was my mistake , because she didn ' t understand what i was saying on the phone . excuse me , but we speak english in this country , and if you can ' t speak the language of your clientele , then maybe you shouldn ' t be answering the phone and taking orders . they refunded my money , and refused to give me what i ordered . so goodbye , tuk tuk . . . you suk suk . from now on i ' ll take my business to spice , that just opened up one block away . 
my experience here on wednesday finally pushed me to sign up for yelp . terrible ! got to the restaurant and was greeted by a relatively rude hostess . sat at a table with a skinny waiter with a buzz cut . he was sooo rude the entire night . my father and i ordered pork chops and they were both hammered . we complained to the waiter and he very abruptly grabbed them from our settings . no apology . no visit from a manager . food was really mediocre at best . i had a pumpkin salad that was good . i had the chicken to replace the pork chop that was uninspired and served with boring mash potatoes and green beans . the crazy noise level and uninspired food wouldn ' t have bothered me so much if the service wasn ' t so bad . i think we left a N tip but it should have been left . will never return ! 
after reading these reviews i had mixed feelings , my expectations kept going up and down and i decided to go to the restaurant with no expectations at all . i ' m a born and raised new yorker and found lombardi ' s pizza to be just another pizza . they may have been the first but maybe not the best . service was so-so , we went early so no lines , the pizza was soggy , oily ( as oppose to other yelpers claims ) , and they were stingy with the toppings . maybe i went on a day when everything was going wrong , i really dont understand the Nstars from some people . my drink had either paper or lettuce floating inside and the tap or water from the hose was cloudy . dont get me wrong , the pizza wasnt crap off the floor but it was just another pizza nothing to rave about . we ordered a large for N ( we were starving ) but i think a small would have been fine . this place is really relying on their rep . for being the first pizza place to get customers . 
do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for ramen , not an overhyped , over-crowded chain restaurant that you can ' t get into , where they don ' t care about you , and where they ' ve been serving the same uninteresting , not innovative menu forever . i am also annoyed by white people who shout irrashaimase as if they ' re japanese . i ' m sure it ' s a house policy , but it ' s stupid , and the whole shouting gimmick is stupid , too . japanese people do not shout at you all the time . the hosts are pretty rude , too , and not terribly helpful or responsive , even if you ' ve been waiting for awhile ( and god forbid your whole party isn ' t ready when you ' re called--you go to the bottom of the list ) . our server was nice but didn ' t seem to know much about ramen or sake , which may be important if you want to order them . whatever . i ' m done with ippudo . try it once , because your annoying friends want you to . then go to hide chan across town , jin in harlem , perhaps the new ivan ramen on the far west side , dassara in brooklyn , or even totto if you can get in . ippudo is loud , crowded , and corporate not worth it . 
i ' ve been getting my lunch there N-N times a week since they opened last spring . it is family-owned by a young married couple and the husband ' s mother . this is authentic mexican food , from family recipes , and it ' s simple , not fancy or americanized . you get your food in plain aluminum foil in a plain bag , no frills . i love all kinds of mexican food , and before this place , the only option for lunch was taco bell . never again ! i love their pico de gallo , and always ask for extra with whatever i order--it ' s become a major food group for me . the chicken quesadilla makes a very satisfying lunch , and just the aroma makes others in the office jealous . be sure to takes a few containers of homemade salsa . they have mild , hot , and " volcano . " they use local , fresh ingredients , so the salsa does change a little from day to day or week to week , depending on what they get at the local farmer ' s market . i kind of like tasting the variations that result . i ' m addicted to the volcano . i ' m a stickler for chicken being real , white-meat chicken with no grizzle or skin , and this chicken is always good . the chicken and shredded pork tend to be a little bland on their own , though tthey are both lean and not fatty at all just add the salsa and pico de gallo to make them very tasty . their specials are often excellent , usually the mom ' s old family recipes . they do chicken mole about once every N weeks , and it ' s definitely worth a try . . . it ' s enough for me for both lunch and dinner . it ' s really rich and has the many-layered complex flavor mole is supposed to have , and it stands up to some of the mole i ' ve had in finer-dining mexican places . i ' m not a big dessert person , but even i love their desserts . i like flan when it ' s good , not too eggy and not instant-pudding-trying-to-be-flan . their flan is really good--you can get it by the piece , or buy a whole big round one if you want to take it to a party . they also have this new dessert that has a layer of flan and a layer of super-moist and rich chocolate cake . very inexpensive ! i don ' t know what the other poster expected when they said the prices were high ! and for the person who said it wasn ' t spicy enough , you can ask for salsa or pico to be added to the inside if you like , and that makes it more than spicy enough , especially if you get the volcano salsa . update july N i still love this place , and all of the above is still true . you must try the " impossible " dessert ( top layer of flan and bottom layer of moist chocolate cake ) . it ' s addictive ! 
vorn and raised in carteret . burger express has been a favorite place to eat . food is terrific . miss taylor ham , egg and cheese ' fried chicken can ' t be beat . don ' t get up there very often , but when i do , i hit burger express . we need one down here in toms river . 
decent pizza what is wrong with the staff ? ? ? i live one block from this place , and i want to love it . i only get one thing from this place . the cappicolo pizza , i think it is delicious and i love the spicy sausage and basil leaves . i haven ' t tried anything else , so i can ' t judge anything menu wise . but the cappicolo , i would give N stars . the reason for the N star rating is the service ! N of the time it is horrid . the staff behaves in a way that makes you think you are burdening them by coming in to eat their food . i have only eaten in here twice and both times weren ' t pleasant , one of the times my parents from out of town where visiting me- i was embarrassed for bringing my parents to experience their lack of good service . most of the times i pick up and one time i had to snap my fingers at the staff ( which i think is very rude to do ) because i came in , three employees turned , looked at me and turned back around and kept talking and ignored me saying " excuse me " three times . they got me that out of line because of thier blatent disrespect of a patron . now there are N-N people who are consistently nice and courteous ( even offering glass of water while i wait ) but overall the rest of them spoil it for them and spoil the pizza in a way . i only take out now because they are so close and as far as pizza goes they are actually quite healthy . i do think that N for the size you get is ridiculous , i think N- N is more reasonable considering the size of the pie you get . 
love the ramen , it is the best ramen ever ! long wait if dont get there before Npm . however , the bartender at the entrance is the rudest bartender we ever met in new york . she walked past us and said that there are lots of non tipper this evening . she said it loud enough for all of us to hear her excuse me , wtf ! ! ! ! you want me to tip you for pouring me one beer under like N seconds and you call that service ! ! ? ? never in million years i am going to tip you horrible attitude and service ! cannot believe a top list japanese ramen restaurant would hire such bartender , fire her . and if you are going to the place , do not recommend to order anything at the bar . just go into restaurant , service is way better ! ! ! 
i recently convinced myself once again that castalia delivers . . an authentic italian trattoria always striving for great value to the customer . whether it be small twists in service , food and ambiance - it is working so well . we have been a fan of castalia for several reasons , and they just seem to keep them coming . we were simply into the wine and dine experience there . always have liked the ambiance and decor which have been updated tastefully in the last couple of years . really like the great choice of salads and seafood appetizers . the florida rock shrimp " with kick " better remain a restaurant secret - it is amazingly tasty and reason enough to stop by all in itself . plus , a solid wine list with good names at affordable prices by the glass and bottle . a well-rounded restaurant to entertain or just enjoy a night out . what initially drew us to castalia was their authentic menu that truly gives you every option - important when you are making a crowd happy . promise that the pickier gourmet will be pleased as well . it is not a problem at castalia . menu and entertainment schedule can be found on their website . you can enjoy vietello and pollo ( veal or chicken ) made to order as your favorite italian dish served as marsala , franchese , parmigiana , piccata - you name it . every variation is made from scratch and delicious . presentation is simple with style and portion size is very generous . same is true for their appetizer salads that are offered with your favorite topping . try the seared scallops or shrimp - along with rustic bread . once again , the rock shrimp has us coming back for more every time . it rocks . great news is , now castalia ' s bar area has been opened up for the more casual encounter at castalia . they are now offering some delicious popular bar foods . this is ideal for a happy hour gathering or light snack paired with a cocktail . i was impressed after my most recent visit with friends . i personally find that it just got a touch fancier through an added modern twist . an atmosphere with just the right amount of lighting , decor and staff friendliness has been adapted into the expanded bar area . i love to kick back there any chance i get with my friends . highly recommend castalia . 
this place be the bomb diggity . people are very friendly , food is also straight up off the chain . they be representin india real hard . 
part of my childhood - back from the days before the old place burned down and this was the only mcd ' s in windsor . . . i suppose i love it so much since this is what defined pizza in my youth . everything else is a copy . really good chicken parm grinder . 
i had an amazing coffee with almond milk . this is a luxury for someone lactose-intolerant . 
we had the tasting menu lunch on may Nth . lovely restaurant , excellent service , and the food was good . minor complaints N . dining room was chilly . N . N servings of ice cream were served in a row -- a lychee sherbet , a small serving of wheat flavored ice cream , then ice cream served with the " main " desert course of either chocolate or pear cake . i like ice cream but . . . . N . weak " coffee shop " served -- undrinkable . maybe the expresso is better . 
i just moved to old city and have started to frequent the different bars and restaurants . amada is my hands down favorite . a bit pricey , but jose garces really delivers some unique dishes that are well worth it . this place is perfect to go with friends and try something new . definitely get a pitcher of sangria , it ' always a win ! 
got a roast pork sandwich with sharp prov and spinach . it was pretty good . thoughts bread was good , it had its own flavor that actually came through which doesn ' t happen a lot . not a fan of spinach , it was kind of bland . rabe not offered . good portion for an ok price . cheese steaks looked great , might have to try one later . 
the tacos are good . . but as a vegetarian , i found the potato mixture to be bland . it tasted like boiled potatoes with no flavor . i wouldn ' t go out of my way to come here , but if you are in the neighborhood , you can check it out . 
absolutely wonderful . everything about this place is spot on . the staff was very helpful in suggesting rolls and it was especially cool to be able to see them make the rolls in front of you . by the time they ' re done they ' ve created a beautiful , colorful , masterpiece that tastes as good as it looks . i ' m not vegan , but this place makes me think it wouldn ' t be so hard to convert haha . the best part is that you leave feeling full and energetic without that crappy feeling you get from eating a greasy burger . it ' s cute , cozy and delish . new favorite spot in nyc . 
we came here at an off-time so we didn ' t have to wait for long to get a table . the ramen here is absolutely delicious . the broth is hearty and heavenly . the pork belly is super tender and tasty . i don ' t think i put my chopsticks down until i finished my entire bowl . i will definitely be coming back . 
i adore this place . classy and friendly . upscale , but relaxed . the tartine d ' ancoiade was stunning . the brandade tasty . . . . but it was the rabbit ( bone in ) cooked in mustard with boiled potatoes that really charmed me . the boys behind the bar are great . the maps on the wall indicating the location of the wines is such a cool idea . please go to this place . N big stars
been here a few times not really my cup of tea . the atmosphere does nothing for me typical bar setting with lcd tv ' s . ordered the so called ny strip steak very tough not tender at all . potatoes were bland at least for my taste . the asparagus that comes with the meal were burnt . then again it ' s a bar i give city streets N stars . 
not what it used to be ! the quality of food and service has plummeted . will not return after years of eating there . most disturbed by the proprietor ' s appalling behavior this past weekend screaming in the street at neighborhood residents . 
oh ippudo , how i ' ve heard so much about you ! let ' s start by saying you are well overrated and i acknowledge that by giving you a good review i am contributing to it . i loved the broth , but the noodles were just too light for my liking . i like more chew in my noodles . seriously ? charging N-N for toppings just seems outrageous ! why isn ' t there a standard bowl that comes with all the toppings instead of recommending N-N add on and having people order it ? the pork buns were heavenly , somehow they got the pork just right where it was still juicy and laced it with their special sauce . i loved the flavor and could go back for more . conclusion , i would go back , but no way am i waiting on that line , yeah that line you see from a block away ! 
about as ordinary as a jersey diner can get , but-- as their diners , drive-in ' s dives recognition attests-- blessed with a very talented promotions team . nothing here is noteworthy food , service or decor . to those of us raised in the area , this wasn ' t always the case . before they remodeled ( circa N ) , the tick-tock was legendary for their cheese omelets and as being the after-hours meeting spot . in its day the tick-tock epitomized everything a grungy dive could be , while still remaining beloved . their breakfasts were also textbook-perfect examples of the fine art . memories die hard . 
stellar . we are obnoxiously picky foodies . . . don ' t often go out for breakfast lunch brunch as we can usually do it better ourselves at home . but this place is phenomenal - please try it . it beats sabrina ' s ( which makes up for meh food with enormous quantities ) to a pulp . the servers are attentive and pleasant , and we enjoy the rehabbed-warehouse aesthetic . not enough bike parking , though . 
cute byob with a hidden little patio in the back . the pizza is very good- interesting combinations and we ' ve loved them all . the sausage fontina pie was our favorite so far , and the special pie with corn was delicious . the meatballs are excellent and the special salads are always really fresh and out of the ordinary . 
dear levee , it isn ' t often that i say this , but i love you . i can always count on you after a bad day ( or a good one , for that matter ) . whether you ' re offering up dreamsicles ( also known as heaven in a glass ) or a shot of tequila and a lone star ( for only N ! ! ) , i know you ' ll be there for me . i may avoid you on the weekends , but please don ' t take it personal . i ' ll be back next week to play scrabble , hunt deer , and eat cheese puffs . i promise . you are the only one for me . love , sarah
so i needed to find a place for brunch for a loved one ' s birthday . i came here a year or so ago and remembered enjoying my meal . this place was third on my list and the least expensive- although still rather pricey . they serve sunday brunch till Npm which was very convinient . and we made a reservation for a later time and they were very nice to sit us earlier . the wait service was not great . one thing i love is their bread- which i had to ask for ! the brunch was not what i expected so i felt a little cheated . but wait- the birthday boy did enjoyed his salmon benedict but as for me . . . no hard feelings just no good feelings . 
this place is usually overcrowded . maybe that ' s why i have such high expectations but the quality of the produce almost always disappoints . however , there is a surprisingly diverse offering of food . i highly recommend trying the pennsylvania dutch vendors . the new balsamic shop is pretty nice , too . other favorites include salumeria and the famous Nth street cookie company . 
been here a couple of times now . . . the gaucho al tempranillo and pollo a la havanera are both delicious dishes . and try the paella . only reason they don ' t get N stars , is because i was horrified that they charged us N for a tiny serving of pinchos - that were only sub-par . i think we literally got N skewers total . other than that - service is great , and the mojitos are delicious ! ! and the live band was great . 
after eating at fogo de chao , i say forget all the other ' steakhouses ' with their hefty price tags for steak and extra charges for everything else ! i ' ve tried several of the steakhouses that claim to be the best and i ' ve never had meat as scrumptious as the meat at fogo de chao ! the salad bar rocks too so , you have to be very careful to save room for all of the delicious meat that keeps coming until you say stop . this place is highly dangerous because it is sooooo delicious ! don ' t eat anything else on the day of your visit so you can take advantage of everything they offer . also , don ' t make any plans for doing anything after your visit if you ' re like my husband and i ( we can eat and we love meat ) because this place will certainly leave you in a food coma . great wine selection too . . . enjoy ! 
it ' s amazing ! so good taste and nice service ! it is worth the waiting and price ! i hope i can try bbq next time
best subs in new haven . . . try the mozz capicola roasted peppers . . . delish ! everything is fresh , the portions are huge , and the flavors are amazing . why bother with the mediocrity of subway when this place is right around the corner ? 
my wife and i had been wanted to try this restaurant for sometime since we both love beef - both at restaurants and at home . while the overall service and atmosphere were good the food and value were poor . we found our steaks ( house filet mignon and prime sirloin ) to taste good but we found more grizzle in the meat that we would expect . the crab cake appetizer , warm bread , and creamed spinach side were bland . the lobster tail and the garlic mashed potatoes were very good . the service staff was friendly and helpful but we were surprised when the steaks were served that the knife supplied looked like a butter knife with a serrated edge that did a terrible job of cutting the steak . we asked the wait staff about it and they apologized and said that they had gotten new knives but forgot to give them to us when we were served our food . overall we did not care for our meal especially because of the high price . 
every single thing we ate was delicious ! we chose tony ' s , because there were only two of us you are able to order individual meals at lunch time . the service was great , and our only regret was there is no tony ' s near where we live so we could go every week ! 
i was very pleasantly surprised when i happened upon this restaurant on fairmount . it was hard to decide among all of the tasty-sounding items on the menu . the place is bustling there ' s a hum of activity and conversation . the staff is friendly and attentive . i ' ve been twice . the first time , i had the scallop ceviche and the krispy ( their spelling ) kale salad . they were delicious--fresh and flavorful . i returned and had the kale salad again , with a cheeseburger . this time , the egg on the salad was undercooked . the server said she comped the entire salad but she only took off N . i didn ' t balk at that , since i ate all of the kale and just left the egg behind ( very easy to do when it ' s raw ) . the burger was delicious . i didn ' t finish the hand-cut fries but they were tasty . i will give them another try . there are many more menu items i want to taste . 
the pizza at grimaldi ' s is reallyyyyy good . i live in the area and have been here several times . i love the pizza . the crust is thin and crispy and the cheese is fresh . the only downfall is the line . even on a rainy weekday , the line is usually a N minute wait . i ' d say its worth it though . 
love it , love it , love it ! ! ! diner has everything you want in a brooklyn restaurant , with out too much of the hispter sass . the bartenders are awesome , relaxed and fun , and they make a good drink to boot . the food is always good , although i have trouble remember the ingredients to the ever changing dishes as the servers recite the menu and write it on the table . . . but it ' s okay , just remember one , order the meal , and you won ' t be disappointed ! 
food is not great , nothing was hot when served and everything was a little underseasoned . coffee is average at best , they don ' t really know how to make good espresso drinks . service was horrible . we had two different servers both coming over to our table repeatedly asking for our drink order and if we were ready to order food . they obviously weren ' t communicating with each other at all . one guy dropped the check book standing up in between my husband and i while we were still eating ! there were other empty tables in the dining room so there was no reason to make us feel like we needed to rush out of there . all it will take is one good cafe in west philly serving well made espresso drinks and great food and this place will be gone if it doesn ' t step up it ' s game . two stars because the atmosphere itself was fine and it ' s close to my apartment . 
it was for the last N years my favorite place to eat in newark nj , that is until today . i went there last night , like i do several times a year , and upon arrival i was told that if i wanted a table at the bar one was about to vacant and if i wanted to wait maybe N or N m i could have that table , i agreed and waited , after N m of waiting another waiter came and asked what i wanted and i told him that i was waiting for that table , which he answered that the table i had been waiting for the past N m was after all reserved . i was completely furious and he told that wasn ' t is fault and that was nothing he could do . i left and told him that they never would see me or my again . i advise everybody that wants to do there to make sure upon arrival that they really have a table waiting for them . very bad management . 
as i entered the beautifully decorated restaurant , i felt the jitters of excitement at entering a new and unfamiliar atmosphere . it didn ' t matter . i was wearing my favorite black dress , with the gray boyish jacket borrowed lovingly from my partner . i was immediately greeted by an unbelievably beautiful hostess , who focused all her attention on me as if i was the only patron that evening . she did tell me there would be a small wait , but i was free to sit at the bar if i ' d like . i gave her my name , and sat on a stool by the bench table across from the active bar . immediately i was greeted by a sloshing englishwoman who was seated precariously on one of the wonderfully comfortable stools to my right . she asked my name . after i disclosed it , she encouraged me to " flip my skirt up " and order a damn drink . she then started rambling about american men and their inability to satisfy her . i adored her instantly . i should note here that she was a patron , and not the staff at distilled . although i think they would do well to hire her for a mascot . every few minutes , i was greeted by a member of staff who asked me if i was comfortable , or if i would like a drink . i was both comfortable and feeling sexily assaulted by virginia woolf next to me , so thanked them , but declined the offer of a drink . i was having far too much fun sober . the hostess came to me after only a little while and told me my table was ready . she led me past the tables , and seated me on a risen platform . straight to my right was the open kitchen . i could not have chosen a better spot had i seated myself . my server was enthusiastic , and asked if i had been there before . when i told her i had not , she had taken the time to go over the menu with me , even though i knew exactly what i wanted . i ordered , and my light lager was brought out immediately , which made my toes curl . i had ordered the wings , because . . . you must order the wings . have you not read the reviews ? take it from me , you must order the wings or forever be branded as a loser and charlatan . because i was seated so closely to the kitchen , i had a chance to watch the godlike dancers display their craft . intensely beautiful in their movement , and quite lovely to look at , the cooks expertly conveyed around each other in complete focus of the tickets rattling around in their heads . there was one in particular , that when he snapped his glove on , without even being aware , made the temperature rise in my bemused soul . i had fallen in love immediately when i realized he was the one . yes . the one . it was the man who would be making my wings . i nicknamed him neo and i could only imagine what his facial hair would feel like brushing my cheek after a nightcap . when my order was brought out , i could only manage to stare . it was plated beautifully , and i lost my breath . i was writing on parchment by ink and fountain pen , and for a moment forgotten where i was , and what i was writing about . they brought many napkins , as well as a packaged wet wipe . the wings , while perfectly divine , crispy and drenched in a exquisite sauce , make you messier than mike rowe at the end of an episode of dirty jobs . do not let that scare you . the delicious food is completely worth your temporary filth . while the staff were busier than a one legged man during a butt kicking contest , i never for one moment felt neglected . my glass was always full , my server always accessible , and my food was absolute perfection . kudos to my gorgeous neo , all of the cooks , and the wonderful experience that all the staff brought to this fantastic friday night . fin . 
all i have to say is wow this place brings me to my happy place probably the best dumplings i ever had a deffenetly i say a must go can ' t go wrong cheap and its very good
came here for sunday brunch which is a fixed price , N course , N pp menu not including drinks . enjoyed the meal , but for five stars and a definite return visit need to fix two things ( see below ) . the food was all good , creative but yet still comfortable for breakfast . surprisingly , one of the highlights was the homemade granola which my wife ordered only because her first choice wasn ' t available . i ordered the tortilla espanola as my first . seemed very dry , pre-prepared . it was a miss . second courses softly scrambled eggs and eggs benedict . both outstanding . would order either dish again . both sweets we ordered were good to close out the meal . two improvements value . i really felt the menu should have included one drink bloody mary , sangria , or at least tea and coffee . food was excellent , but N for food and then drinks , tax and tip and you are well over N for breakfast ( for N ) . the food wasn ' t that good . heat . i mean here , the food wasn ' t hot . it was luke warm and really , no one wants luke warm eggs . 
dirty tagging on expose wall , overpriced and small portions on foods , some foods were prepackaged , frozen and re-heated while others were specifically prepared . worst thing , the squid was not fresh . best thing , good prices on pitchers of beer . 
oh heyyyyyyyy N crown . . . you ' re cute . if you were a person , i ' d probably date you . cozy , hip , cool , welcoming . thank god for happy hour because if not , you ' re dropping some dough on drinks ( averaging N dollars a pop ) . we didn ' t have restaurant week here , but the menu looked delish . are you trying to be hipster ? or do you already think you are ? i think you ' re a little muddled . either your manager wears a hoodie and sneaks or he wears a suit . either way , pick a vibe and roll with it . it was high end meets grubby fingernails . . . . with insanely expensive drinks . my drink was very good , a tweed margarita . . . but my cucumber that was deliciously muddled , seemed to be lacking some body . stick those shizz in the cooler ! don ' t leave them on the counter . sure , it looks pretty , but you ' re losing the purity of product . i ' m interested to go back and try the food . it really did look and smell very good . definitely a good happy hour spot though . . . if you don ' t mind the lack of friendly bartenders . . . seriously , a smile and a hello wouldn ' t kill ya . 
the food is not nearly as good and a lot more expensive than other vietnamese restaurants in chinatown ( e . g . nha trang one ) . the last time we had the vermicelli noodles , it had a strange soapy like taste . i called to complain but was told that the noodles were probably still on the wet side ( however that doesn ' t explain the awful taste ) . perhaps that ' s one reason why they received a " b " rating . 
great place . . . buffet is awesome and reasonable price . . . all indian food are good ( south or north ) . . . must go place . 
fantastic panini . the only thing that compares is a tiny shop in florence called eno . 
soooo excited we finally have a place like this in the neighborhood . damikele offers a wonderful dining experience . from the gracious service to the delicious dishes to the quaint and cozy ambiance , this is a great local escape for casual rustic italian dining . they also have great cocktails , fruit of the day mojito ( mixed dark berries is awesome ) , fresh peach puree bellini and the spritz are all deliciously refreshing . foods we recommend the meat and cheese platter , beef carpaccio , fried calamari ( don ' t like fried food , but this was really good and light ) , rice balls ( rice balls were a special , really good . definitely order it if it ' s on the menu ) . the zucchini parmigiana was a big hit . the al prosciutto a cono ( cone shaped pizza with prosciutto , mozzarella , baby arugula and parmesan ) was also really good . the wines by the glass and bottle are very reasonably priced and good ! the food menu is also very reasonably priced and portions are generous . love damikeke ! 
this restaurant bar was recommended by a colleague - and it certainly didn ' t disappoint . an inviting and charming neighbourhood place , extensive wine list and bar options , varied menu and served by friendly and helpful staff ( including the owner ) . food was tasty . my only criticisms - there are always criticisms - might be the relatively high noise level , and the tables are fairly small and occasionally was a challenge to find room for plates and glasses . camembert was good . it was just so yummy . also a wine bar , we will seek it out next time we are in that city . prices ? i can ' t tell . . . i was invited , so didn ' t pay much attention to them . 
this place is an old school mom and pop diner , the hospitality when you walk in is impressive all the way until you leave . the owner makes everybody feel special and he looks like the kind that would feed a whole family for free if they had no money . the food has its days , the last time i ate there , it was so so , before that it was great ! ! i mean when the place is busy , the food is rushed , alot of action going on , you cant take it to heart over a hamburger a little well done or something not to your satisfaction . overall the place has great food . the place is closed on sundays though , what a bummer
stopped in for a late late breakfast at the legendary clinton st . baking company ( note even at N N pm on a monday , there was a N minute wait ) . thought we were being slick , going on a weekday afternoon . . . . still had to wait . the host was extremely friendly and sat us N minutes earlier than we thought . the ambiance and service are only so-so here and the prices are average for manhattan . we split a biscuit to start , it was massive and probably the high point of the meal . also , their preserves ( homemade ? ) are amazingly good-definitely do this as an " appetizer " ( also you will be famished from waiting to be sat for so long ) . girlfriend had the famed blueberry pancakes , which were delicious , i opted for the southern breakfast . the cheese grits were underwhelming , but the fried green tomatoes hit the spot . i saw someone order the chicken sandwich-it looked excellent- will definitely try that if i ever find myself here again . overall , hyped to max-but still a solid breakfast . 
i just placed an order of a regular pie to be delivered . they answered the phone quickly and kindly answered my questions . they said it would be N . N and only N minutes ( in-town delivery . ) i couldn ' t believe the delivery was actually on time and the pizza was pretty big . it was a thin crust and lightly seasoned . i appreciated the timely customer service on such a rainy night ! 
great late night dining place . one of the few places open N hours in astoria . awesome beer and wine list . i have also been there for brunch , they offer a special N . N menu that you can choose from N different items plus a cup of coffee or juice . a downside . . . delivery take forever . my suggestion , call ahead and pick up your order . 
i ' m a fan of grimaldi ' s . the pizza isn ' t the best , but still good . the service is quick , but you might be waiting a while to get a table . the staff is friendly , until you ask more than N questions . prices are cheap . and don ' t pull out a credit card , that kind of sorcery is not accepted here , according to the waiter . 
i want to give this place N stars but the aftermath was unbearable . i came here early and didn ' t have to wait for a table . early as in around Npm . by the time we left which was about Npm , there was a long line ! we ordered the soon doo boo with beef and seafood , as well as squid and tofu on a hot plate . the squid dish was large- its great for sharing . it was a little too oily for my taste though . the soon doo boo was delicious as usual . our raw egg did not cook very well in it so we had to break the egg yolk and mix it around well . the side dishes were good . note that if you want to take home any leftovers , they won ' t allow you to take home the side dishes . now let met tell you a little secret . i don ' t handle spicy foods very well and i found the food to be quite spicy . of course there was some race to help save the day but it was still spicy . after i had finished eating , i dashed to the toilet . stomach ache . N min later , i was attempting to walk a few blocks down the street and oh oh oh . i bent over in pain . i rushed into the nearest mcdonalds but there was a line for the bathroom . . . i kept walking , each step faster than the one before . i saw a starbucks and dashed in . what ensued shall not be described here . N min later while i was suffering in pain , some crazy old lady started banging the bathroom door beecuase she wanted to use the bathroom . she pretty much chased me out of there . why was my destination so far ? i ketp walking , and thinking of the bathroom . finally , i gave up , hopped on a cab and made it to my very own personal bathroom . i feel as if i am forever scarred for life from eating here- might have to bring a box of pepto bismol with me if i ever come back . 
the service is quick and the food is tasty . i ' m not vietnamese so i can ' t say whether it ' s authentic but i ' m going to guess that it is according to the crowd it draws in . the tables and chairs are a little too close to each other for my liking and it may get a bit on the noisy end , but the quality of food is what keeps us coming back for more . the parking situation is also difficult because it shares the same lot as its neighboring stores and restaurant . we ended up just avoid the struggle all together by parking along one of the side streets . a much better alternative ! 
love penny cluse ! the wait is a bit annoying but this is because it is so good . i recommend going on an off hour . great service and lots of options for all kinds of diets . i love the orzo chicken salad . but if you are looking to spurge try their breakfast specials like banana bread french toast . 
please stop going here ! ! ! ! the only thing bad about this place is that everyone else loves it too , and it is always packed . drinks are fantastic , so is the food . the bartenders and servers are friendly . . . . really the only problem is that too many people like this place ( not a bad problem to have ) . 
highly average . the roasted spicy chicken wings is a tiny tiny serving and the wine selection was pretty uninteresting . my merguez sandwich had too much salty goat cheese and barely had any meat in it . my friend ordered the pulled chicken club sandwich and really liked it , but he was the only person who was satisfied with his order . other friends ordered the steak and polenta , the feijoada and the queso fresco sandwich , they were all pretty mediocre . the space is pretty tiny but if you ' re a large enough group they have a largish private table at the back . 
it ' s so tiny we missed it walking down the street and had to turn back around . glad we turned around because this was exactly what we were looking for breakfast . eggs , bacon , potatoes , tostada , cafe con leche - yum . this place was cheap for nyc in the theater district . we definitely paid less than N for breakfast including the tip . we saw them making the cuban sandwiches before we left and ended up coming back there for lunch . we ordered the cuban sandwich and it was really good too . they offer a lot of traditional dishes cafeteria style like arroz con gandules and pernil . they gave us a free sample of some chicken drummette which i really enjoyed too . 
taste good malaysian cuisine is the best ! ! ! ! i ' ve been trying a few malaysian ' s restaurant both in manhattan chinatown and queens . this is the only place i go for authentic malaysian food after i have checked in the hotel in the city . most customer are locals and not many tourist know about this place . love their hainanese chicken rice , curry noodles , char kuey teow , kangkung belacan , bubur cha cha , pulut hitam and homemade herbal drink . their price is reasonable too ! service is a lot better than the rest of the malaysian restaurant in town . i can ' t wait for my next trip to new york ) 
the overall experience was good and the beers were tasty . fun crowd , a little dark which is great when you ' re looking for it on a friday night out . what was not so fun however was when i was over charged . . . although the bartender had apparently refunded it , a week later it had not appeared . when i called with my concerns i was blown off by the day staff multiple times and told to reach out to my bank because it was no longer their problem , and then when i called again , someone took my info and said that it would take a few days to clear up . . . i am still waiting for the call . i may consider going back , but i will only be paying cash . 
i was in wethersfield doing some shopping after work and decided to stop in for dinner . from the outside , it is small and modest . the decor on the inside is beautiful and elegant . the best thing about this place is service . their waiters waitresses are very well trained , attentive and knowledgeable . the food was very good , more impressive was the staffs willingness to deal with food allergies . although most restaurants are ok with accommodating allergies , they sometimes make you feel like you are burdening them . the staff here was happy to help ! 
awesome ! ! best " chicken on rice " . 
so loud you can ' t hear across the table . . . . . if you get here early ( or late ) enough , you have a better chance of actually enjoying the cozy surroundings instead of screaming yourself hoarse just to address your server . the monk fish special was laughably tiny , with two slices and some tiny potatoes for N . pretentious and pricey . . . . full of itself . . . . . left me still hungry . " noise level average " ? ? ? ? ? ? 
really good food , really nice selection , really small and crowded , worth a trip . 
we were there only twice but we probably tried almost everything . i started off with a beer and bacon flight that got me excited about the rest of the meal . i was not let down . the bacon cheeseburger , which i know sounds boring , was slammin ' ! you have a choice between N types of bacon . the best by far is the neusky ' s house bacon . the wings were officially the best i ' ve ever had . grilled cheese was okay , lobster roll was delicious . the staff was extremely helpful and easy to find . the beer was cold , the bacon hot and crisp , and my boy june made us feel like we were at home . " june said yes ! " 
i have been to this restaurant numerous times both for lunch and for dinner . the burgers are incredible ! i have also had sandwiches and apps here and everything has been consistently delicious . the staff is friendly and attentive . great place ! 
despite what others have said i think hiro ramen is top notch . is it as authentic as some of the ny spots or over in japan ? not really , but their own version of ramen is quite tasty . the menu was limited but then again their ingredients are locally sourced and hurricane sandy just hit the surrounding area . the broth of the shoyu ramen was rich and flavorful . the noodles were a little similar to chinese egg noodles as compared to some other ramen that i had before but it was very good and well prepared to al dente . plenty of toppings in the bowl of ramen with two pieces of pork belly , bamboo shoots , half of a soft cooked egg , nori , and scallions . service was great and the staff was very friendly . all this for only N ? it ' s a no brainer . 
ive been to the castello plan a few times . the good the softly steampunk design of the establishment , both inside and out , is downright gorgeous . the food is delicious , and the is service attentive . the bad pretension . the castello plan is one of the most pretentious places i ' ve been to in the city . i don ' t know how this is possible , i mean its in brooklyn , eclectic ditmas park no less . every time i walk in to the establishment i feel weird . . . remember that odd feeling you used to get back in high school , the one you got when you somehow found yourself in the middle of a different social circle ? yea . perhaps i need to become a regular at the castello plan to shake that ' outsider ' feeling . but alas , i refuse to become a regular there because along with the pretension comes relatively overpriced , stingily portioned food . somehow , despite the inviting atmosphere , everything feels a bit too calculated . that said , what do i know . i ' m fully aware that im not a N something w . a . s . p . and N something w . a . s . p . seems to be the crowd the castello plan aims to serve . its working for them . . . . ( to be fair , if one comes for brunch , the pretension isnt really there . brunch N stars ) 
N of us ate at ' chapter one ' last evening . . what a great find . . staff was helpful . . service was good . . whether appetizer or entree blend of ingredients was perfect without being overpowering . . sound level was acceptable . . i will definitely be a repeat patron . . i wish them great success . . restaurant was not full but by N p . m . the bar was hopping with hungry individuals . . 
best sushi i ' ve ever had in my life ! the menu has the most diverse ( and non-traditional ) sushi selection i ' ve ever seen . don ' t let the appearance of miya ' s scare you away , the service food is phenomenal . i had a variety of veggie rolls and a berry sake sangria ( huge , N , and delicious - ding ding ding ) definitely looking forward to becoming a regular here . . . 
loved it . first visit to the bluebird tavern . brought mom for mother ' s day brunch . i had the candied bacon waffle with poached egg and hollandaise . delicious ! checked in on four square and we were rewarded with a free vermont cheese platter for the table . also received complimentary mini muffins with chocolate chips and espresso beans . very good . ordered a sausage flatbread with arugula appetizer for the table . very good , not sure what kind of sausage it was , but really good . one of my boys got a " short stack " of pancakes . it consisted of four fairly large pancakes . way more than he could eat , they were good . a little light on the maple syrup . other son got a monte cristo , he liked it but did not love it . wife got a burger , two patties . very good . healthy serving of fires . this was the only plate with leftovers . pretty big serving . our server , karen , could not have been nicer . very accommodating and conversational . at one point she heard my son make a reference to arrested development and she was very excited - " there ' s always money in the banana stand " . anyhow back to the food . will definitely be back . food was great , service was great . parking garage literally next door helps as burlington parking is sometimes less than convenient . 
i am not sure how to rate roberta ' s . i would give the pizza N stars and the service N stars . these people are all a-holes and i hope the pizza oven catches fire and the place burns to the ground . i ' ll find good pizza somewhere else . 
yum yum yum ! ! ! for a person that does not like pancakes , i have to tell you , i absolutely love them here ! ! if you get the dutch pancake though , make sure you have the time - it takes about N minutes to bake ( yes , they bake a pancake and when you see it you will understand why ) . they also have the best hash i have ever had ! ! the prices are decent , and although they get busy , the staff are always attentive to your needs and work as a team . 
great place . . . . went with a group and everyone left satisfied
i dont need to write too many words as the N stars are worth of thousand words for this place . completely revolutionary idea of serving people of philadelphia city . the owner is great guy and helps us find the right choice of dosa . the sambar is just authentic and i love the way they offer different chutneys . the addition of chicken items is definitely a plus point now . 
best indian restaurant for having the best atmosphere . great decor and ambiance . the only bad thing is the price . food taste is good . not exactly authentic indian cuisine but was ok . price is too high to feed yourself . overall was a good experience . i would come back with a beautiful girlfriend , otherwise i would wait for a handsome paycheck to have a meal there . 
this place has good points and some points that need a bit more attention . walking in , it looks like there ' s two small tables in the corner and the bar . not til you see people emerging from the basement would you know there ' s a downstairs . wine selection is different . the wines are from regions of the world not really known for wines . lebanon ? israel ? good wines , i must say . a bit expensive . food is good . a tad expensive as well . salmon blt is made with raw , smoked salmon , which is delicious . it got crowded for a small stretch . but it seemed as though people were stopping by for a drink before venturing on . down side , the bartenders ( N of them , it seemed ) seemed over whelmed by the number of people upstairs at one point as well as a full house downstairs . when we first got there , the bartender gave us the " first sip " to see if we liked it . after that , it appeared that certain people were given this courteousness , and only on certain wines . a good place to venture out to if you wanna try some different wines besides the normal napa valley italian wines you get at other bars and some good food . 
this is a great little place to get a drink or a good pub meal . one of the oldest bars in new york , it really gives the feel of a dusty irish pub . you can sit outside in the summer which is cool , but be aware that motorcyclists frequent this place , at least on thursdays . it ' s cool if you like bikes since they park them right out front , but it gets a bit crowded . the food is good , and perhaps a bit underrated , too . great burgers and sandwiches , but don ' t hesitate to order something slightly less run-of-the-mill . anything that seems distinctly irish or english--like shepherd ' s pie--is bound to be good . great beers on tap like sierra and boddington ' s and the taps are kept pretty clean . it ' s reasonably priced , but not necessarily cheap . definitely worth the stop if you ' re in the area . 
really . i think that this place has horrible " mexican " food . they have some crazy guacamole ' s which are decent but i ' m not even sure they qualify as a south of the border dish . i went there recently on a nice evening and sat inside . the N-something bunch who looked as if they met up on match . com were hovering over our table . i ordered the fish tacos which resembled mcdonald ' s snack wraps . literally fried fish fingers with a piece of lettuce an overused " chipotle " mayonnaise and a warmed up tortilla . i guess you get bonus points for a bathroom hand washing experience that makes everyone feel awkward . 
i just want to say this is one of my favorite restaurants . yes , the staff is sometimes a little uptight , depending on your waiter waitress , but i have never had a bad meal here and have been a patron here for at least N-N times a year for the past N years . they just know they are busy and know their food is good . it ' s true , it ' s a pain in the ass to get reservations , but make them well in advance and you will not be disappointed . 
went to the taproom tonight . all i can say is omg ! ! ! i had the smoked coconut club and my hubby had the mushroom grinder . both sandwiches were delicious and full of flavor . we started with the hummus and it was so good . . . just a touch of spicy pepper . it was served with fresh carrot and cucumber slices and pita . the place was packed and yet we were seated in about N minutes . there are many many many beers to choose from . . . . just be ware that some beers are a bit pricey N to N . in a nut shell , great food , drink , and service . can ' t wait to go back . 
this has got to be some of the best , most authentic cuisine i ' ve eaten in philly . i find that a lot of restaurants are skimpy on their portions and lack flavor and love ( the most important ingredient ) . the service here at ratchada was amazing , friendly , attentive and professional . the food was flavorful , fresh , authentic and clearly crafted by someone who knows and loves what they do in the kitchen . i will be here again soon . and you should go , too ! 
man , what a loss ! this place once sold some of the best vegetarian food in the neighborhood . the hongos taco was a neighborhood staple among myself and friends . after moving locations , service and quality has begun to decline . i no longer eat at chavellas . the cuisine is sub-par and the best vegetarian menu items have been discontinued . crown heights has better mexican fare . this place is not worth the wait . 
consistently great experiences ! great food , friendly staff , excellent location . . . check , check , check ! we have been coming here for years . . . it ' s a go-to spot . i usually get a medium dallas burger with sweet potato fries ( it comes with the most amazing honey mustard horseradish sauce ) . hubs always switches his order up and even gets the turkey burgers . we are huge fans and love this place . 
can ' t say enough about this place . waited for the daily show , they recommended them , and when we told the bartender-we got happy hour pricing . top reasons to go there taylor ham cheap beer skee ball tater tot menu cute bartenders N cent wings with N pitchers dee-lish
i came for the hanger steak . i had it . it was one of the most flavorful steaks i have ever had . now for some curative cardiovascular exercise . . . minus one star for the ridiculous wait . 
i only write reviews for places that i really like and places that i really dislike and this place was the really dislike . came here during restaurant week for a friends birthday . i had brought my own ice-cream cake and N candles ( my friend was turning N ) and asked the lady if she could please put N candles . ( to be continued ) app i got the calamari . i have had many , many calamari plates from different restaurants and this was probably the worst . olive garden makes them better and i ' m not even trying to be funny , they do . i also got the caprese salad . i was expecting beautiful red tomatoes with a nice piece of mozzarella ( i asked for all sauces on the side ) . the tomato was cooked gross , the mozzarella was the size of a circle made from my thumb and index finger they put the sauces on top which i asked for them not to do . main course i got the penne vodka with shrimp . this was half decent . shrimp was the only good thing i ate all night and i couldn ' t even enjoy it for a long time because there were N pieces . dessert my favorite part of the entire meal which is pretty sad because its the one thing they did not make . also , they put N candles on the cake . theres just something wrong here . its way too expensive for the quality of this food . no go . sorry . 
one of the all time great philadelphia eateries and a prime example of amazing italian market food . i ' ve been coming here as long as i can remember and pretty much ordering the same thing every time . roast pork , provolone , raw onions . easy . basic . delicious . filling . this is the third best roast pork sandwich i ' ve ever had ( first being shank ' s near penn ' s landing , p g deli in prospect park ) . the bread is excellent and the sharp prov melts perfectly . you must eat this sandwich within N to N minutes ( even N is pushing it ) or it will be soggy and messy , . don ' t go inside , order from the window , get it wrapped up and eat at one of the tables in front of lorenzo ' s right next door . everytime i ' m even remotely in the area , i have to get a sandwich from george ' s , it ' s the best . the roast beef is very good too . same deal as the pork , messy and wet , very lovely and tender meat . i ' m not a huge tripe guy , but the sauce they use is excellent . that ' s all i ' ve had from george ' s . why order anything else ? 
having had the pleasure of not only dining here , but being shortly employed as well , i have an inside and unvarnished opinion . no where else can an establishment have such great highs and also sustain some incredibly low lows . in general here the management is less than enthusiastic about the guests . the ongoing joke is is usually on the native princetonians ( like myself ) . somehow they all forget , that the " needly " locals are the same individual who fund their paychecks ! past reviews have been spot on ! the food poisoned burger review specifically shows how little the general manager cares . the lastest review about the female manager yelling at the server in front of guests is an oh too familiar account of everyday moornic occurances from her management style . in general the managers are more worried about their bonuses then actual happy guests . trust me , the staff hears about it , whenever a managers bonus is possibly hurt ! the food however is holding steady . my family eats there almost religiously , and we have learned to overlook the bad service . the food has always been decent , even though multiple kitchen management changes . love the crabcakes , sweet mama desserts , and salads . beef has been better
ok sooo i ' m torn . i had a banging time at northstar last night at the mimosa show as i whipped unsuspecting glow stick wielding N yr olds in the face with my sweat drenched hair ( que willow smith ) . but i can ' t say my good time was due to northstar ' s menu ( though i do thank them for booking an awesome show ) . buuttttt . . . the food . dude . come . on . i had the chorizo flatbread , well i mean i took a few bites . putting N slices of spicy jimmy dean sausage on a piece of dough with a few red onions and no sauce ain ' t a chorizo flatbread nah mean ? so then i had a mad case of food envy and starting picking at a friend ' s mac and cheese . hey so uh last time i checked there are two main ingredients in mac and cheese macaroni noodles and cheese . well , one ingredient was missing , cheese . none . it tasted like oily butter noodles that you serve a N yr old picky eater . i need to start keeping the kraft orange cheese powder packets in my purse for such occasions . not impressed . at that point i felt like a mooching ass goldilocks . . . . i had to try baby bear ' s hot wings . " juuuuusssstttt right " . kudos . so all in all , i did have a great time at northstar despite a few subpar entrees . i ' ll be back i ' m sure but will definitely order something else . 
i don ' t understand the other complaints , this place is great . the price is great and the service is great as well . my wife and i were very impressed with the chicken and broccoli and the singapore mei phun . i never went to hong kong so i have nothing to compare it to except other chinese american food spots and this place rocks . i do agree that the place is empty but i think it ' s because of it ' s location . there is only on street parking and most of it ' s customers probably order out . this place is great if you want to take a day off cooking and enjoy quality food at a good and fair price . 
they used to be pretty good a few years ago . it seems they just stopped trying , im talking about the food as well as the service . 
i have been going to the king for N years now . mike , the owner , is a great guy who knows his stuff ! his hummus is the best you will find , as are the shishtawook , lentils , and babaganooj . the syrian cheese whith cucumbers is fantastic ! all in all everything at the king is great . the prices can ' t be beat either . my normal meal there is syrian cheese , shish tawook , and hummus . i spend N . mike makes the best middle eastern food around , and the prices can ' t be beat ! 
loved the burger ! if you do not like it fried , get grilled , its delicious . and so slo drink is the best dessert ) 
i believe this is my favorite cuban restaurant in nyc . 
awesome place . if you ' re patient and have nowhere else to be , that is . contrary to other reviewers , i got to sally ' s at a reasonable time where the line was only two parties deep , so i got in quick . however , it was another story once i got in . i understand that this isn ' t domino ' s , and quality takes time . but my small pizza took over an hour to get to me . i just don ' t consider that reasonable . this isn ' t domino ' s , but this also isn ' t peter luger ' s . also , cash only and no free refills . boo . now , complaints aside , the pizza was fantastic . i ' d say as good as frank pepe ' s , maybe even slightly better in some regards . i ' m not usually a thin crust guy , but the crust here is very enjoyable . it isn ' t paper thin like some places . the cheese is gooey and delicious , as is the sauce . now i ' m about N minutes away from new haven , so i won ' t be a frequent visitor here , but even if i were closer , i ' d probably just keep it to the one visit . i can say i came here , but as good as the pizza is , it isn ' t N-N minute wait good . also , even if i wanted carry-out , they add fees to that for some reason . so it was a good visit , but probably my last . 
we just moved to burlington , and bluebird is easily our favorite restaurant out of all the places we ' ve tried here . the food is fantastic--thoughtfully sourced , prepared , and presented , and consistently delicious . the staff are friendly and responsive . we ' ve been to bluebird N or N times already and have been thrilled with each dinner . the chicken wings and burgers are top shelf , some of the best i ' ve ever had . they ' ve got a great beer list and serve rookies root bear . haven ' t tried brunch yet , but we ' ve heard it ' s great too . 
great little cheap italian eatery that no one really knows about . i went on a thursday with a friend and was seated right away . the lasagna was pretty good but wasn ' t " omg , this is the best lasagna ever " good . the seafood pasta dish ( fruitt di mare ) was piled high with tons of seafood . the staff was very attentive and friendly . 
really amazing menu at good prices . so many delicious vegetable dishes . really kind and helpful service . cool atmosphere . 
positives the place is very nicely decorated and food was N N . avocado shrimp crevettes were delicious and very filling for an appetizer . negatives the service was horrendous throughout . absolute worst i have ever experienced . waiter ( guy with huge , black frame glasses ) seemed to not even listen to us when we were ordering . came back to ask us what entrees we ordered and what drinks . N minutes after we ordered , one of my friends gets her drink . i never got mine despite twice telling him what i ordered . we get another waiters attention and he asks us " do you ladies feel neglected ? " N minutes and no drinks when the place is empty ! he reassured us and said he will have a talk with the other waiter . N-N minutes later i get my drink and whole table gets appetizers . meanwhile the couple at the table next to us who came N-N minutes after had already had their drinks , appetizers and started on their steak entrees . when we finally get our entrees , the couple next to us had already left . the couple on the other side that also came after just received their entrees . i receive my entree and see bacon all over it even though i requested ( twice since he initially forgot the order ) that no bacon be used . so i had to sit around while they cooked up another . as great as the food was , the experience to get it was not worth it . 
the food here is good but not the price , i ' d eat elsewhere where real mexican cook your food . 
food was great , burger was very tasty but extremely overrated as " best burger in philly " ( listed in the top N burgers on at least N or N sites including phillymag ) . it ' s delicious but nowhere near the best and for N it ' s crazy overpriced . N stars because very overpriced . my wife and i split a burger and an appetizer , and i ordered N glass of wine . bill N . . . yeah . . . no . this isn ' t ny , need ny salaries to pay for ny burgers people . staff was nice but the fryer was down and we couldn ' t order N of the things we wanted and they didn ' t offer a discount or even suggest solid alternatives . 
continental midtown . i have been here twice . overall , this is an average spot . both times i ended up here because other places we tried to get into were booked for the night . not a place where you are so blown away by the experience , that you are wanting to make a reservation for your next visit , before you even leave the restaurant that night . and that ' s how i distribute my yelp starr ratings . . . on that thought process . the food is ok . nothing special . the tapas are fun to order and share , but nothing really made me say " wow , i must eat this again ! " . the best thing i ate there was the korean pork tacos . the prices are reasonable . the beer list is pathetic . nothing on draft , all bottles . the service was solid each time . the decor and overall style of the restaurant is tacky and outdated , but i guess that is what starr was going for with the whole diner theme . one thing we noticed , or should i say smelled , while here is half of the restaurant smells like an ol ' dirty rag . at the downstairs bar , we noticed an unpleasant odor emanating from the bar top . then again , when we were seated upstairs the smell had followed us . anybody else notice this ? not good . overall , two starrs . 
i had my doubts . and then i waited in a line at N Npm on a friday night--it ' s delicious . honestly , it ' s delicious . for N , you get basmati rice , lettuce , tomatoes , falafel , chicken , hot ( very , very , very , so deliciously spicy ) sauce and oh gosh the magical white sauce . please go . first time in new york and i enjoyed every last second of this delicious location . these guys wear the shirts ' we ' re different ' and are only there in the evenings ( apparently ) . in chicago i have to settle for taco bell for late night college food . if i had gone to school in new york this would be my joint , night in and night out . 
luzzo ' s is all around fantastic . it ' s simply and tastefully decorated , the service has been consistently wonderful , and the truffle pie is out of control . i dream about it . a nice place to go on a casual date . one of my favorite pizza spots in nyc . i used to live across the street and miss it terribly . 
my husband and i celebrated our Nth wedding anniversary at colicchio sons tap room . we had an amazing time . our table was intimate with a nice view . the food and service were excellent and exceeded our expectations . the restaurant included on the top or our menu " happy anniversary ann steven . " they gave us a special complimentary dessert and a special drink to celebrate as well . several people from the restaurant staff came to our table to wish us a happy anniversary . at the end of our meal , before we left , they gave us a copy of our special menu to take home , neatly folded in an envelope . they also included muffins for our next day ' s breakfast . they made us feel very special ! i highly recommend this restaurant especially for a special occasion . 
used to like their pizza . they delivered the wrong thing knowingly making substitutions i didn ' t want or to pay for . bad customer service to make up for their wrong doing and mistake . sent another pizza in ever worse condition , i ' m positive with vindictiveness for complaining about their mistake for the first . i refused both , shoved them back at the delivery person and told them not to charge my card . when i came to my front door later i found that the delivery person smashed the sloppy pizza all over my doorstep and welcome mat , ruining them both . people who operate in life like this have no business owning and running a business . filing with bbb and consumer affairs and taking them to small claims to get money back for pizza i didn ' t receive and the property they damaged . 
we were seated in the back and had a leisurely lovely N . N hour meal . goose martini was well chilled . the celery root soup appetizer and flounder entree were delicious . chocolate dessert was heavenly . wait staff were attentive without being intrusive . clean restaurant . 
the soba here is so delicious and authentic ! the interior decorations really make you feel like your in japan . i love sitting by the bar to interact with the cook . my favorite is definitely the duck soba . the broth is always deep with layers of flavor , and the soba is silky and soft . try pairing your meal with cold or hot soba tea , it has a very strong roasted flavor and pairs perfectly with your meal . 
this place reeks history nyc man ! don ' t ever visit nyc without stepping for a bite . i ' m an oldtime nyer but i still love to go to lombardi once in a while for their delicious pizza . pizza is made extremely well . the dough lives up to expectation where you have a thin crust but sturdy enough to carry all the moisture from the tomato sauce . not a big fan of their popular clam pizza . it ' s great if you like clam , but a bit on the dry-side for a pizza since it doesn ' t come with white sauce or red sauce . 
horrible experience . the food was okay , wasn ' t fresh at all , and the prices are low . sure great thing . but we went there and sat down to eat . N minutes later they turned on the damn vacuum and no one could really talk anymore . it switched from from a quiet place to now a place with a loud vacuum cleaner running non stop . they kept coming to our table to sweep and mop in between us eating our dinner . we were told to move our feet , while our mouths were ful , so they could clean under our table . not one single server was cheerful or pleasant . i am never going back . 
the early bird specials ( i think thats what these were ) are really good . the portions are pretty large and the broth is delicious . i ' m hungry just thinking about the sobas . 
after a couple not so great experiences , i finally realized that london is one of those really great neighborhood places-if you know what to order . went here with my hubby and another couple-the nachos for the app were great , and they brought us a little plate of mushrooms to sample . i had the mussels in red for my entree which were great-the mussels were big , the bowl filled generously , and the red sauce was great ! everyone else in my group was happy too with the food . the sangria wasn ' t so great . one of the big benefits , in my opinion , is that unlike a lot of restaurants , they ' ll let you order off the bar menu in the dining room , which has good prices . 
worst pizza of my life ! came here for my first night in nyc . my bf and i shared a mushroom , spinach , and red pepper pizza . i noticed they sell red peppers by the jar here so i figured it must be good ! its pretty expensive for every additional topping , like N or N . there was no wait but it was also Npm on a wednesday . the pizza was super soggy and didn ' t taste like anything special . we ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day before going to the met and it was the soggiest leftover pizza i ' ve ever had . it was like it was already digested or soaked in water or something . so gross . pizza is one of my favorite foods and this was the only place i had ny style pizza at so i ' m pretty disappointed ! 
needed a place to eat - close to the arena where i was going to a concert . i am born and raised in the city of trenton but it " ain ' t " what it used to be and it is hard to find a place in the city where you can feel safe anymore . trenton social was suggested to me and i and a few friends walked to it from the arena parking lot . wow - were we pleasantly surprised . the decor is beautifully done , casual and comfortable with sofas amongst the tables - very eclectic - loved it . and - on top of that , the food was outstanding . each of us ordered something different and each of us loved our food . considering how crowded it became , the service was good . we look fsorward to getting back there . hope this is a sign that trenton is on the move up . 
cute little place with simple yet tasty , perfectly executed food . the jawn sandwich was delicious . doesn ' t sound super special on paper , but this baby was perfectly executed . warm with melty cheese , all the flavours in the jawn melded just right . every bite was a pleasure . ( they were out of pretzel bread , but it still worked . ) truffled egg salad was great too . it ' s hard not to enjoy something with truffle oil drizzled on it , but the egg salad itself was also just really fresh and good . simple , good , fresh food . good service . just perfect . 
great food always great job
i went to vonda ' s for the first time on sunday march N at Npm . it was busy ! . it was hard to tell which people were for tables or for take out . i waited N minutes for a table . i ordered the crab cake breakfast . i waited and waited about N minutes later to be told that my order had to be made from scratch . it took N minutes to get my order ! my lady was grumpy as she was starving . the staff really didn ' tgive any compensation for my poor waiting experience . the food was good . i may go back for lunch . 
came here the night of N N N while i was in philly for a business trip . went there because it ' s supposed to be the oldest tavern in the city . it was a somewhat hidden bar down some alley off another alley . the clientele appeared to be mostly locals , but i could be wrong . i would describe it as slightly above a dive bar . it ' s two stories , which i discovered when going to the restroom . it was very crowded and noisy . apparently they serve food , but i didn ' t eat here . since it had a good selection of local microbrews , i decided to order the N local drafts sampler ( N . N ) . unfortunately , i can ' t recall which two were my favorite . they were very good sized servings , but i ' m disappointed to say they got lukewarm pretty fast . 
i ordered from here , i love bbq and for my birthday lunch me and my bf decided to order upon my request . my N dollar dinner involved on dry small portion meat . like a summer picnic scraps . my bfs sausage and pepper was mostly bun and peppers with maybe two sausages and full of grease , his lips looked like he had lipgloss , the only thing that was alright was the corn on the cob , yet served cold . after all that we had tummy twirls and led for my to stay home and miss my birthday dinner . very upset . 
such a great place . waitress samantha was amazing in relaying my dietary requests to the chef , who made a meal that could be bland into a satisfying tasteful meal . worth the cost in my eyes ! the atmosphere was unlike any other that i have been to , and made for a great evening- and was able to enjoy the beautiful sunset ! 
whenever i go to new york i always make a point to eat here . personally i don ' t think a trip to new york is successful without stopping by the halal guys . the line fluctuates from being really long to being short . for the food i like how much meat they give . i usually do a mixed platter of lamb and chicken . the rice is also super tasty and fluffy . then dab some red sauce and some white sauce on and you ' ll be golden . if people are hesitant about how clean it looks i tell them to not look at how they cook the stuff just eat it ! so bring cash and be ready to wait in line for a bit . i ' ll definitely go again next time i ' m in the big apple . 
this place was said to be very popular but i thought that the pizza was okay and pretty average . i did like that it had a lot of history behind he establishment and that we go to view the kitchen as we were on our way to our seats , but besides that i thought that the place was somewhat overrated . but i do recommend that you go in for yourself . 
i was looking forward to trying a babaganoush falafel sandwich . some of my friends from the office walked over N blocks to find the crisp truck - after walking in the smoldering hot weather and not finding the truck , they decided to go into the crisp rest . on Nth st . from what they told me , they encountered a very unpleasant , uncooperative and dismissive employee by the name of ian . he was offensive and completely lacking customer service skills . they ordered crisps and falafel sandwiches , but ian ended up giving them falafel burgers . when they brought it up to his attention , instead of apologizing for his mistake and rectifying the situation , he became very dismissive and argumentative . one of the workers there realized what was happening and wanted to re-do everything the right way , as initially ordered , however , ian jumped in and aggressively stopped the process . although shocked and very disappointed , my friends tried to calmly explain to him once again that it was his mistake and that he misunderstood the orders - he simply refused to listen to them . cumstomer satisfaction was clearly not on his priority list . . needless to say , my friends are very unhappy with today ' s experience and so am i . they brought me back something i did not order , but what ian decided to give me . . . a very small burger ( instead of a falafel sandwich ) . . it had very little babaganoush that one could barely even taste it and it was so small that i now have to go buy something else to eat - it was the size of a snack . . . way to go , ian ! ! ! we will never again come to crisp because of you . i hope you did your manager and crisp owners very proud today . . hungry and hugely disappointed
had a couple slices before a show . it was really good and really fresh . we stayed longer than we should have , before the show , and they were ok with that . 
pete ' s has brought me back a couple times because they have a really nice service staff that is always attentive . the owner has put right people in place to create a quite and fun little corner bar . 
i have visited chengdu for evening meals , the food and service have always been fine . i have camped out in the lounge and watched a couple baseball games as well . i did not realize they had a lunch special . i noticed that josh s . mentioned this in his review . i uploaded an image of the lunch special menu . the pricing here is lunch special pricing . that said , for N . more ( plus tax and tip ) you can have soup , great service and sit down dining . i was seated by a host , and almost immediately i placed order with a server . general tso ' s chicken with brown rice and won-ton soup . i was served complimentary water and fried noodles , while my order was being prepared . my soup was served ahead of the entree , after the entree was served , a waiter checked in to see if everything was ok . as i finished eating , i was offered tea . i was surprised to see this high level of service . there were N high school students there on a chinese new year class trip ! ! the staff still attended to me and a few other diners while this was going on . i took a picture of the general tso ' s chicken , i hope it is uploaded . it really was wonderful . a truly huge portion of well prepared delicious food . lots of broccoli and the rice was very good as well . all in all , i have to say . . . even though i was recently impressed by a local take out restaurant . this place is an exceptional value . i spent N . N including tax and tip . if i just wanted to order take out , the total would be N . N plus tax . look at the food ! ! ! wow . very nicely prepared , a great value and the service was really a nice change of pace for lunch . 
prices are decent enough , but the food is mediocre even by bar standards . plus , the lunchtime bartender was pretty obnoxious . 
not sure about N stars ! i was not so impressed ! maybe because service was not as good ? or because the chef was off ? 
um , if you go here you must get the coffee ice cream with the zeppoles ( fried dough thing ) holy cow , it was like the best dessert ever ! 
birthday reservations for my girlfriend . . . . restaurant rubbed me the wrong way from the start . we made reservations for june Nth N . we arrived a little early around N N so we expected a wait but not the wait we received . we were seated around N N-N N . you would think the place was packed out - not at all - about half full ! after being a little annoyed about the wait and the staff completely disregarding the notes on my reservation to be sat by the window - we tried to let it go . upon sitting i noticed a dirty place setting followed by a N minute wait for water . our appetizer empanadas came put relatively fast tho . they were pretty tasty . we placed entr e order at about N N or so - entrees didn ' t get to our table N N . . . to me that is unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! i ordered the skirt steak which would have been good if it was hot ! ! ! ! my girlfriend had a stuffed chicken dish which she enjoyed . . . . one highlight they remembered to bring the birthday dessert ( flan ) but by that point we were both fed up
burgers and shakes are excellent stuff . fries not so much unfortunately . 
best burgers and fries in the city . everything on the menu is good . great neighborhood bar with wide variety of beers that changes often . my only complaint is that the bartenders have a bit of an attitude , but the kitchen staff has always been great . 
i absolutely loved brunch here . i was there on a sunny sunday afternoon with some friends . we wanted outdoor seating and didn ' t have to wait long . i got the eggs blackstone special and a french N cocktail . i enjoyed everything on the plate . the organic eggs , potatoes , bacon , tomatoes , sauce and the bread ! our server took a little long to take our order but aside from that the service was good . i will be back . 
thai kitchen iii is really great ! ! the food is great ! the service is great ! the people are really nice ! i especially prefer the red curry , it ' s great ! plus , it ' s a really nice , cute , pretty , place and it ' s very enjoyable to eat there . 
my mouth salivates as i write this post , which is long overdue as it has been three years since i first tried their cuban sandwich and grilled corn . since that first encounter , i have been back to nyc two more times and each time , cafe habana is a must , if not the first stop ! i am not a big fan of ham nor cucumber , but somehow these ingredients sneak their way into my mouth with every bite of the cuban sandwich . the special sauce is what makes this sandwich--a blend of tangy and spicy--it totally complements the pork , ham , and cheese all stuffed inside a warm , toasty bread . the best partner to this sandwich is the grilled corn , topped with what seems to be mayo , cheese , and chili powder . i ' ve glanced at the other items on the menu , but not dare pass up a visit without having the " usual . " it ' s enough . more than enough that every time i go home , i spend my last day making a stop here to load up on at least two meals worth of the " usual " to fly back home to san jose . and yes , after N hours of travel , it ' s still that good once reheated toasted . 
i ' ve been here twice randomly . Nst , the day after new yearsN with a crew of friends and a stranger ( i was the stranger , but the rest were ladies ) ) . . . and recently when i was in nyc trying to find a parking spot mid day , and bahm , it was right next to penelopes . both times , i was incredibly satisfied with the home grown fresh warming food in this semi diner like space with a charasmatic staff and yummy brunch like menus . the people that come here seem to be the same . . . very chill , happy , love their warm hot coffee in a big mug , and great food with company . come here with a small crew ( N-N ) , bring a book , newspaper if by yourself . enjoy their homemade food , and chalkboard full of specials . i ' d come back for brunch any day ! come here wiht a few friends to catch up early in the morning or during the day . grab a cup of joe and chat away . 
weird decor for a lake side location . food was ok not good . staff was friendly . need to work out some kinks before i decide to ever go back . 
we found tavola by accident , but we are so glad that we did . we sampled several different pizzas and all were incredible . our waiter malik was very knowledgable and professional . our food out in a timely manner . make sure to save room for a few desserts they are all delicious . 
so the general rule of thumb here is they just do it right . so no need to ask for anything substituted , or any modifications from the menu - because N ) whatever you ' re ordering doesn ' t need it and N ) the chef wont do it for you anyways . so just go with that . tables piled intimately close - some spots are almost even pushing it ( with a big ass pole in between us but still nice corner spot with natural light shining in ) . i had the florentine - very good . side of bacon really good - cooked perfectly - big , hearty pieces . glasses of orange juice as we sat down . coffee was good - don ' t even think about asking for skim milk . cant wait to go back and try the croque monsieur . also want to look into what nights are bring-your-own-wine . 
a tourist trap near the brooklyn bridge . like some nyc restaurants , the chairs are small and so are the tables . is that the nature of nyc tourist traps or restaurants in general ? real estate in manhattan is prime so it is probably the latter--although , we are in brooklyn . . . we ordered a basic pizza--half pepperoni with the other half pepperoni mushrooms . i wanted it basic so that i could taste the essence of a ny pizza without having the flavors of the toppings confuse me . our table thought the pizza was bland . i arrived in ny for the first time under the impression that ny makes great pizza . that is proving to be a misconception on my part . ny pizza is a different style of pizza , but not necessarily a better pizza . i ' d take jj dolan ' s or cosmo ' s secret pizza . i have to recognize the staff as being very friendly and catering . this goes for owner manager , our waiter , and all other servers . . . our very friendly and engaging waiter who hails from rome talked us into splitting a connoli for dessert . i found the connoli a lot more satisfying than the pizza . on future trips to nyc , i doubt i will return . instead , i will try other pizzerias in search of pizzas that will wow me . . . ! 
it is an experience thing , and something fun to do . buy one at each place , cut them in half , or um , tear them in half , and share the halves with a significant other or friend , etc and compare them . by the way , its not racist to ask a person to order in a language that the person taking the order can understand . it is racist however , to insist someone learn the language you want to order in because you refuse to assimilate and learn the language of your adopted country . ive been to other countries , and i assure you , they expect you to learn their language if you want to live there . 
great place to eat . casual and very friendly . also , byob and shoprite liquors is right next store so it keeps your costs down . come in with some beer and order the burger . it ' s fantastic , the way burgers should be made big , juicy , and on the grill . a must if your a burger fan . also , my wife had the bbq chicken which i tried and it was delicious . very juicy and fresh and a generous portion . the sauce it was served with was excellent . it had just the right amount of heat . i recommend this place . 
was one of my favorites until they charged a N cancellation fee for a large party reservation . i called within N hours but they require N - totally absurd and total bs . really poor customer service
dude ! this was by far the best pizza i have ever had ! if you visit nyc you must go and visit this place . hands down the best ! 
one word . . . wow ! definitely , the best lobster roll i have ever had ! great addition to philadelphia . stopped in the other day , ordered N lobster rolls and enjoyed every succulent bite ! definitely could have eaten N more ! ! i suppose N ea is a bit pricey however , they load those buns with a lot of lobster ! 
went back here a few years later , and i think the quality has gone downhill . i order the lamb ragu , and it was so salty i could barely choke it down . shame . 
a meat lover ' s paradise , try the flank steak , lambshank , veal etc . all veritable bargains for the price . come early or you ' ll have a frustrating endless wait unless you have the patience of a golden retriever . 
it was amazing ! we had the sigara boregi , which were fried cheese rolls . we also had the chicken shish kebab . i definitely recommend this place . great for families , and great prices . attentive staff and delicious food ! ! ! 
this is a small place in chinatown , with not much seating . i had to wait for about N min before i was seated . i think its byob ? i saw people bring their own alcohol . also , you need to pay for water i think . i wasn ' t sure of what to order but i saw everyone order the big tray of chicken . so i did the same . it was spicy , and delicious . the meat was so tender ! i also had the handpulled noodles with fishballs . the fishballs had pork in them , those are the best kind . i wish i had more space to order the dumplings , and the pancakes . the prices are super reasonable too . can ' t wait to come back . 
i was really excited to finally get the chance to go to sahara grill this past weekend , and was not at all disappointed . i went with a group and everybody liked their order . my sister and one of my friends got the beef kabob , which they claim was top-notch ( i don ' t eat meat , so can ' t say myself ) , and the accompanying rice was made the traditional way with thin noodles and seasoning very tasty , if a bit heavy on the salt . i ordered the grape leaf platter , which was surprisingly good . it ' s generally hard to find restaurants that serve good grape leaves , but the ones at sahara are pretty decent . as other have said , the hummus is amazing , as is the baba ghannouj . two thumbs up for the tabbouleh , too . most places either get lazy and don ' t chop the parsley finely enough , or just don ' t add enough oil , lemon and salt , but this tabbouleh was really fantastic and extremely flavorful . a friend ordered the mjaddarah ( rice and lentils with sauteed onions ) , which was also quite well done and full of yummy spices . and then the falafel . my goodness was the falafel scrumptious ! and that brings me to the service . i ' m surprised to read that others had sub-par service experiences , because the gentleman who served us ( i ' m guessing the owner ) was incredibly nice . he made a middle eastern carbonated yogurt drink ( dukh ) for my two friends himself since what they wanted wasn ' t on the menu , and when our falafel orders got lost in the shuffle of trying to serve all the people trying to break fast ( this was the last day of ramadan ) , he gave us all a piece of ( excellent ) baklava for free to make up for the trouble . definitely going back ! 
its like a non-chain pietro ' s . if you have family in town and need an inexpensive but impressive place to have a casual meal after a day of touristing , this is a place i ' d recommend . someone else said ' reliable ' . to me , reliable means am likely to enjoy my entire meal with no great effort on my part . spasso fits that bill and i think that about sums it up . and bridgett at the bar is wonderful ! 
lovely place in williamsburg . have been here twice now , both times for dinner , and it really doesnt disappoint . feels very homey inside , but during the warmer days , id recommend trying to get a table outside - it may be a bit cramped , but it feels like your own little private courtyard . the food feels , while trying to be south american , more new american . from the regular menu , the octopus white bean cassoulet are probably one of the best things you will ever have . the filet mignon sandwich feels rustic , and is really comfort food at its finest . do dedicate an outing to w-burg to visit this bit of nirvana
i think yelp ' s rating of " meh , i ' ve experienced better " captures the experience at ts ma . customer services leaves much to be desired , and the staff members are rude to customers . some of their dishes are decent , but they use way too much sodium . i will go somewhere else for chinese food that isn ' t so salty and doesn ' t take forever for my order to be ready . 
cashier named megan was horribly rude . i first ordered food to eat in and she hesitantly allowed me to sit at " one of the small tables " . then my plans changed and i adjusted my order to a to-go one . i sat down at a table to wait for my ride to arrive and she came over and told me i could not have to-go food at a table . there was almost no one in the store , plenty of empty tables . i felt as if she then complained to the other cashiers about me and i felt so uncomfortable that i left . i will not be returning to atticus and i am disappointed with the threshold of disrespect towards customers that is tolerated there . 
an unassuming and unpretentious eatery , offering decent food and good service . prices are reasonable , and the broad street cafe is worth a try when passing through the area . 
delicious and made to order , the falafel and frys for N . N is a great deal . the service is friendly and the food is made with love which i appreciate . the making the food takes great care and pride in it . even a seemingly simple falafel has to be done right and they do . my sandwich was made to order , the falafel prepared when i ordered it and wasn ' t precooked and just sitting out ( like most other places ) the frys too were made to order . everything comes fresh and hot . they serve dipping sauce with their frys . . . really good , the frys are excellent . this is the only place i go now for falafels in my neighborhood ( and there are a bunch of them . ) 
went here for a date and it was actually quite a fun place with decently priced drinks - N for a jack and coke . not too crowded just the right amount of people . there ' s plenty to do with darts , pool , deer hunter , and a variety of board games , it provides a lot more fun than most bars . also pretty easy to meet new friends for the night and just hang out . definitely recommend it if you ' re in williamsburg . the hipster scene wasn ' t too overwhelming either which was a plus to me . 
fantastic pizza ! ! ! at the atlantic antic so much fun and the dj was awesome ! ! ! thank you for a great day ! ! ! 
we would love to make this a weekly regular but the prices are too high even though the location is great ! i would love to see some happy hour specials ! ! ! pros great addition to the neighborhood for locals eclectic menu - not just americana cons staff was very new when we went - we were ignored quite a bit - i chalk this up to a new staff though . my biggest cons were the prices . N of us went and each got a burger and N beers and spent N before tax and tip . 
great food and had a great time with my buddies ! 
i say let ' s all call the restaurant and let them know how we feel . call on a busy friday night so we can tie up their lines . or better yet , make reservations and order a glass of water for dinner . 
the sicilian pizza at spimoni gardens is crazyyyyyyyyyy goooooooooooood . their ices are really good too . i come here all the time with my wife and she loves it just as much as i do . 
cheese steak was ok . dont see what the big deal for this place is . very over priced and bland . better cheesesteaks in jersey . 
salads so fresh fish great ! steak great ! food is really good
so cheap for the amount of food you get ( N for lunch buffet ! ) . pizza is very decent and there ' s a wide selection , including buffalo chicken pizza and tomato basil . love the chocolate lava cake . salad bar is fresh and has a decent assortment of vegetables beyond lettuce and tomatoes . you ' ll feel a bit gross after you ' ve eaten here , but what did you expect eating at a pizza buffet ? 
been going to this sub shop for about N years since high school . always the best subs around , and even if they don ' t use all thumans meats their stuff is still very good quality . how many places can you get a N inch sub for under N a special that they run after N every day . 
not good . i ' ve been here a handful of times and have never had a ' great ' experience . we went on here on saturday night because it was the only place around that had no wait for dinner at N pm . we ordered drinks food . the drinks were served promptly ( N sodas and a beer ) but we waited N minutes for our food . ( i kept track because it was getting ridiculous . ) our food wasn ' t even that complicated -- N burgers and a place of macaroni and cheese . honestly , it wasn ' t even worth the wait . the food was so-so , and one of the burgers was cold . next time , i ' ll wait for dinner somewhere else instead . 
i love the vibe there ! such a positive air floating and the mussel crepe with cream sauce is the best ! 
this is our go-to for pizza night . the garden salad is generous and fresh , and the pizza is good . not my favorite pizza in new haven , but very enjoyable when you consider the added convenience of friendly service , fast delivery , and a great price . 
thanks for making my bday celebration incredibly special . the food was delicious , service was superb , atmosphere and ambiance was fantastic and belly dancing was awesome ! we will definitely be back ! 
take your money elsewhere for the real vietnamese banh mi , not the cambodian version , the sandwich here is tiny for banh mi standards and at a whopping N . N-N . N , it ' s definitely pricey . they are stingy with the ingredients and the bread overpowers the rest of the flavors . check out banh mi saigon , nicky ' s , or paris sandwich . . . . who all have much cheaper , bigger ( about twice the size ) , and tastier sandwiches . there ' s absolutely nothing special about this place and the only reason it might stay open is its strategic location . definitely not worth it . 
this is a great place to stop by before or after visting a loved one at arlington cementary . i stopped by on sunday and had a ball . 
this has to be the best pizza outside of italy . it is easily the best pizza in new york . i ' ve been coming here for almost five years and i wouldn ' t say i moved to boerum hill to be closer to it , but i don ' t want to move now that i ' m close to it . freshest ingredients , charming environment and the service makes you feel at home . the waits are never fun but worth it and all it takes is a little bit of planning to limit the hassle . i ' ve also gotten the chance to eat next to jay-z and beyonce on two occasions . can ' t beat that . 
we went on a wednesday night and there were only a few other couples . the waitress was very friendly and helpful . the decor was warm and comfortable . the restaurant specialty was gnocchi . best gnocchi i ever had , and i ' m glad we ordered it as an appetizer . next time i would get it as my main course . we ordered N dishes and they were all timed perfectly , not too close together . 
service i came in with a party of N , and the staff were super accommodating , even though two of our party were running late and slowed down the pace of the evening . even so , the waitstaff was incredibly attentive and responsive to our requests . our waitress had excellent pronunciation of the french items of the menu , and was ready to tailor menu recommendations according to the likes of each guest . the chef , cisse , was very friendly , and as a former chef myself , i could tell that he truly loved what he was doing , and that he was proud to be showcasing the unique flavors of his homeland . his passion really showed in his smile when i chatted with him about the food , and that means a lot to me . the food i ordered the niokolokoba and i must say that this was the best steak i ' ve ever had . to be clear , i do not say this lightly . i have had many a steak in my life , and this was the best . cooked a perfect medium-rare , it literally melted in my mouth . even the fat around the steak was tender and delicious . whatever traditional african spices cisse has paired with this steak are phenomenal an absolutely unique flavor that compliments the beef perfectly , and pairs surprisingly well with a traditional french style poivre ( black pepper ) sauce . honestly , if i never eat another steak again , i will be happy . i just want many many more of this one . the moules africana were delicious . the african-french fusion of ponty bistro really comes through on this dish the traditional french style of steamed mussels in a garlicy white wine sauce paired with pungent african spices was a very interesting and unique combination , but one that worked in perfect balance . most impressive was the serving size ! when seeing mussels on a relatively fine dining menu , i have come to expect a plate with N-N mussels , not a huge bowl literally overflowing with shellfish ! any of their variations on moules are an amazing value . if you like mussels , i highly recommend them . i also had the french onion soup , and it probably ranked among the best i ' ve had . the stock was just packed with flavor , and they didn ' t skimp on the caramelized onions , bread , or cheese , like many places do . i tasted the chicken tagine the pungent african flavors of the chicken and sauce were deliciously paired with a flavorful couscous . i also tasted the special of the evening . i forget what it was called , but it was a traditional senegalese lamb stew served with rice . i don ' t even like lamb , and that was delicious . atmosphere i enjoyed the atmosphere , though some may find that it gets a little too loud on a busy night . it didn ' t bother me , as to me that is a sign of a restaurant filled with happy , satisfied people , but some of the people in my party said they would have liked a quieter atmosphere . but , that just isn ' t the type of place that is ponty bistro . i would recommend making a reservation , regardless of what time or day you wish to go . better safe than sorry ! overall , i had a phenomenal meal in a wonderful little restaurant with an extremely friendly and attentive waitstaff and a chef who truly loves what he does . what more could i ask for ? i will certainly be back . oh , and if you like white wines , i highly recommend their N casal caeiro albari o . 
my secret favorite place is not a secret anymore . best food , service and now they have a bar . this place is family owned and you know it and feel it when you walk in . the owner family is always there and you can tell they care about their food and reputation . after going here for more than N years , i know the owner and his wife now . because they see me in there frequently they know me by name and always give me a warm welcome . this place is no joke ! signed , an honest customer non family member lol
i love the pickle backs here ! delicious , spicy , and i always get them when i am here . french fries are wonderful and i love how you get your own huge sea salt with it ! i just wish the man who checks your id ' s was nicer to sweet afton patrons , it is a neighborhood bar and not a club in the city , relax ! 
after reading the reviews on stacks we decided to give it a try . we later regretted that decision . the breakfast was tasty however our server missy totally neglected us during the meal . she never offered to refill our coffee . she never once came over to see how we were doing . however we noticed that she visited other tables and refilled thrir coffe cups . to make matters worse when my fork was accidentally taken i asked her for another fork . she asked the bus boy to replace it . after waiting more than N mins for a new one i asked another server for one . he gladly handed me one from a server station right behind me . our server was standing in the exact same spot when i asked her for a fork . all she had to do was reach up and hand it to me but neglected to do so . the manager was informed of our displeasure and he discounted the bill . we would return but if the server is missy again we will ask to be seated elsewhere . 
i dined here with one other person on a friday night in june . we had to wait about N minutes for a table , but were told we could grab a drink in the bar while waiting . the interior design is very impressive and they were pretty busy so we did not mind waiting . the bar had three bartenders and we did not have to wait long to give our drink order . we ordered a jw red on the rocks and an old fashioned - N minutes later we were given our drinks , right before we were told our table was ready . i thought the wait for our drinks was a little long , but i didn ' t complain . we ordered steak tartar , a caesar salad and N oz rib-eye to share . the food was great , presentation and taste were impressive . it took over N hours from the time we sat down to the time we finished our meal , so i thought the wait time was very long considering our steak was cooked rare and we were only sharing three things . our waitress was nice , but she was obviously busy and not very attentive . for the three dishes and two glasses of wine we paid about N dollars , not including the tip . 
this is my first visit . we had a department lunch and it was remarkable . ancora is the - old world ambience , friendly wait staff , creative dishes , outstandingly fresh cuisine . i had my favorite , chicken marsala , which was excellent . my coworkers had a varied assortment- ravioli , steak , scungilli , and snapper . everything met or exceeded expectations . while the service was impeccable , the wait between courses was exceedingly long , but that may be attributed to the holiday rush . it was a full house but worth the wait . looking forward to returning for dinner . 
i ' ve been here a few times and love it . highlights - cachapa - cafe con leche - brown sugar lemonade - either of those plastic bottles of sauces that you can squirt on your arepas i came again on sunday and brought some friends from out of town after taking them to a few other spots in queens . they said it was their favorite food of the weekend . it was mine too . 
i love caracas . the other day i realized i ' d probably been to caracas more than any other restaurant in the area . they ' ve never let me down thus far . the de guasacaca and la sure a arepas are excellent , so are the guasacaca chips . get the cocada for a drink or dessert . . . so delicious . i usually only need one arepa to be full , maybe get an appetizer and split it with another , you ' ll be set . recommend the outside garden seating ! 
grab a slice of artichoke pizza at two am after binge drinking . that ' s the real experience . 
recently moved from cali , i live in brooklyn but work at the west village , on my breaks i like to search for places to eat and i ' m so glad i found this place ! it ' s definitely a great place to go to ! ! my waitress was great , didn ' t get her name , she didn ' t need a check book to write my complicated order ( i was afraid she was going to get it wrong ) when i got my food it was perfect ! very delicious ! they have a variety of things and their drinks are a bit expensive but strong ! definitely recommend this place ! ! 
it ' s convenient that i live half a block away from cafe ghia because it is fantastic . the menu features a diverse selection of both vegan and non-vegan dishes . the small but cozy dining room is warm and inviting . the music was good too . i was hoping to try the stuffed peppers but unfortunately they were out by the time i got there . so i settled for grass-fed burger infused with bacon fat . enough said . perfectly cooked and topped with melting vermont cheddar with a tomato aioli on the side . for an appetizer i tried the tostones trio ( N ) which included N fried plantains with seasonal toppings . my favorite was the jalapeno and goat cheese . cafe ghia also has a great selection of cocktails . i am an avid gin and tonic drinker so i went with the brooklyn fizz ( brooklyn gin , earl grey simple syrup , fresh lemon , boker ' s bitters , soda ) . on point . the staff bartender was knowledgeable and friendly . will be back soon . 
it looks pretty sure , but don ' t look fools deceive you . we came here to eat dinner and it took about N minutes to receive our food . this restaurant was not worth the expensive price . N dishes for N ? outrageous , the quantities were terrible , the service was terrible . will never eat here again . the hostess was rude and tended to the only other customers in the room . she intentionally ignored us and our food came N minutes after the order . it was barely anything on the plate . he food was terrible and as apart of this culture , i could have cooked most of this food at home for under N . the quickest she came was to pick up the check , did not tip more than N . no good service , no good tip . 
dinic ' s was clearly the favorite at reading terminal because the line wrapped around and continued to form past neighboring stands -- and for good reason ! the pulled pork sandwich must ' ve been heaven sent -- tender , savory pork wonderfully cut by sharp provolone and garlicky broccoli rabe . i could not believe my tastebuds it was a bit of everything ( heavenly ) in each bite . 
took my mom here for a belated mother ' s day dinner . anthony ( the owner ) was very helpful and knowledgeable about gluten-free cuisine . i ordered the gf pizza and my mom had the di mare which was heavenly ! the bartender was great too . he gave us free glasses of wine and suggested i order the gluten free chocolate roll , mmmm so good . when the bill came , i noticed they didn ' t charge me for dessert and asked our waitress about it . she said it was also comped . i love this place . and yes , gorgeous waitstaff . my mom ( the cougar ) could not stop eyeing the cute waiters . 
the pulled pork is my favorite sandwich in the city . my girlfriend loves the coconut shrimp sandwich . our only thing is we wish they had some better options for sides , and more seating . but for what it is , a tiny amazing sandwich shop- it gets N stars . -cash only
i was there for a birthday party and food was excellent ! ! ! if you want southern cooking this is the place ! ! ! the mac and cheese-excellent ! greens-excellent ! ! the catfish nuggets , i fell in love with it ! the staff was friendly and drinks were good ! i will be back to dine and bring family and friends ! this place is a gem ! i hope you enjoy your dining at duke ' s ! ! 
i have been going to this deli since i was a kid ! they have by far the best hoagies in the area ! the bread is a perfect crunch without being too hard and is packed to the gills with meat ! they also have a delicious potato salad ! i love this place . . . . . won ' t go anywhere else ! ! ! ! 
love me some frankie ' s ! so good . love the faico ' s pork sausage and brown butter cavatelli
what a great place ! i am not a fan of sushi etc , but i have to say this is the first japanese restaurant i ' ve gone to where there are enough non sushi items on the menu that i had a hard time choosing . my choices were great . awesome tempura vegetables to start and then a ginger glaze short ribs ( had to take some home they gave me so much ) for entree . i went with N friends who are into sushi etc and they both loved what they ordered . it ' s a great place to go if there are suhshi fans and non fans in your group . everyone enjoyed
went to dinner here tonight . we sat in the back room which was nice . the salmon tartare was light and delicious . the arugula salad was so good ! i had the slow cooked salmon for entree and it was awesome . the rotisserie chicken entree was savory and tender . the dessert menu looked great but i didn ' t try anything this time . but i ' ll be back ! 
i just finished a family meal at cafe mulino . the meal was the best i ' ve had ! the owners made it a point to come to our table to welcome us and do did the chef ! i had a hard time selecting from the three specials , but finally decided on the lobster ravioli . it was delicious ! the fireplace was roaring , the wine was flowing , and the place was packed . i recommend cafe mulino for dates , families , and anyone looking for a good meal at a good price . 
not thinking of coming back again as a group . afterall there is one restaurant in st . marks that i can compare this restaurant to . i didn ' t think this place was that fabulous the reason i said that is N . the entrace is on the second floor and it is small . when me and my boyfriend got there already two people standing who we didn ' t know at first was part of our meetup group were trying to get a table . just too crowded at the entrance . after a second or two another couple came standing behind me and i stepped on her toes by mistake which i felt very sorry for . she was wearing open toes shoes and i was wearing nike sneakers . ouch ! the waiter waiteress should ' ve have let the two people in front of us to be seated inside the restaurant first . N . we were seated in a small booth that could accomodate N people . thanks to jeff ' s warning that we could possibly get the booth that says " watch your head " . even for me shorter than N ft . N in . needs to be sure that my head does bow down so i won ' t hit my head . only once i entered through that door and twice i just went in through the side which didn ' t have that odd entrance . N . we didn ' t get a waiter that likes us much and we haven ' t tipped him yet . i could understand being a waiter waitress is never that easy to begin with . i kind of notice that there are times when we order some things on the menu he didn ' t understand us . i didn ' t give N stars for N . N . the skewers that we ordered were not enough for six people . word of advice if you have a lot of people in your party just be sure order enough people . each skewer has N to N pieces depending what you are ordering . just plan on ordering more than N skewers . like -totto salad with shiso leaf dressing . -tori dango steamed rice dumplings . comes in N-N pieces . we ordered N of these and make sure order ahead of time because you need to give them some time to cook . maybe i would have experienced better if i came here with a friend and tried different dishes instead of mainly skewers . i felt full at the end not from the food but more from a glass of alcohol with caprico and i didn ' t like the atmosphere . 
today was our Nst time at the neighborhood sports bar . we frequent another bar on football sundays where the food is outstanding as well as the service drink specials . at sidebar , the drinks , no complaints there . there were no drink specials , the place had no identity , there were kids in the place and i do mean under N yr old kids , the chicken wings were rubbery still frozen in the middle and the woman ' s bathroom was freezing cold , where i could see my breath had dirty drink glasses left in it from the night before . the men ' s bathroom , well let ' s just say i hope no one farts because it ' s right next to the bar . the food service was a joke . when we mentioned that the wings were still frozen we expected for those in particular , to not be on the check . any respectable place would have done that , right . not this place . instead , we got a , " we ' ll let them know . " whoever them , may be . let ' s just say , we will not be spending another dime in that place again . being from w . h . , we ' re going to keep our usual sunday funday hangout and just make the drive to avon . 
not bad
the food is solid , but overpriced for what it offers . the waitstaff is a bit snotty and rude . excellent location , though , and a nice ambience inside . 
great service and liked the ambiance . food was very so-so ( at best ) . if you cook well , you can make it better--had the pasta primivera ( they may call it something else ) , beet salad and crab cakes . 
interesting vibe , small portions , decent but not amazing . 
as soon as i walked into the restaurant i fell in love with the decor . you feel like you invited to a tea party in a private garden . everything down to the colors of the plates were carefully thought out . but the food itself was quite underwhelming . the dinner menu choices are a bit unoriginal . and while everything was very tasty , for the prices- i felt that the presentation and variety of ingredients used in each dish were not quite up to par with other restaurants in the city . with that said , i think this could be the perfect spot for brunch . 
somebody , somewhere is going to hate me for not giving this place a N . maybe it was all the hype and building-up , but it was kind of a disappointment ! props to the menu - it looked fantastic . a ridiculously large selection of empanadas ( yummy ! ) , as well as other food ! we enjoyed bloody marys and plantain chips with guac while waiting for our food . everything was delicious . . . . . . . but when the empanadas came . . . they were just alright . i ' ve had much better empanadas at even places like cuba ( restaurant ) --these were a little dry , a little thrown-together , a little fast-food . we ordered eight empanadas between the three of us , and none were mind-blowing . service was okay , decor and seating was okay , but nothing was that impressive . i ' d come back because it ' s cheap , fast , and good for groups - you also don ' t have to " commit " to one main course , because you can build your own meal from a variety of different empanadas . but unbelievably delicious ? nah . 
love this place . rated number N for a reason . attention to detail . 
went here the other day with a friend around N N in the afternoon and although they close from about N-N and reopen at N pm they allowed us to order desert even though it had already been about N , and i must say i never felt rushed or got the impression the waitress had just wanted to leave which was defiantly a pleasure to find . now on to the delicious food , this place is defiantly " hangover comfort food " but either way the homeade , unique menu is like none other ! we had the captain crunch chicken fingers with this incredible red chili bacon caramel sauce that just complimented each other so perfectly , along with the disco tots , the atomic fire balls and their fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade ! this place is a must try , i ' ve also been told the brunch is awesome however my last attempt on a sunday afternoon- an hour wait . byob plus delicious homeade food-defiantly a great catch ! however cash only . 
a little diner located in the west end , they make pretty decent fruit pancakes . i ' d go there if i wanna be cheap
the best pizza i ' ve ever had was at grimaldi ' s . i ' m from the bay area and nothing i ' ve had really compares . the wait was short at just a bit after Npm . i had a large pizza with pepperoni ( delicious ) , garlic and roasted red peppers . everything just worked with this pizza , the cheese and sauce were light , and that balanced out with the richness of the dough . truly delicious , i ' d recommend this to anyone visiting nyc . 
the meatball is amazing ! beer selection is quite interesting . had the calamari as well and it was good ) good experience
a lot of hype but not a lot of deliciousness
the boil is a bayou-style seafood joint that opened in the les in early N to high acclaim . everything you ' ve come to expect from the big easy are here , from the brown paper lined tables , the bucket used to dispose of cracked shells , food served by the pound , and the garlic and butter sifting through the air . touches like the exposed brick and tech-friendly pos system remind you you ' re still in the city . however , this place smells like heaven , especially if you love seafood . eating with your hands isn ' t a new thing . . . as a patron of the boiling crab , and numerous crab shacks along maryland , which put this segment on the map for seafood lovers , i ' d been anxious to compare this place for many , many months , and i ' m glad to finally have that opportunity . one of the most obvious features is the blue gloves and the bib . things that urbanites love right off the bat . no need to wash your hands N million times to wash out the scent ! the appeal also lies within eating together as a group , like family , having a great time cracking shells and sharing the moment . when we were seated we were reminded of the N N time limit . interesting , but makes sense . . . they typically have crowds building up from N Npm straight on ' til closing , so arrive early or be prepared to wait an hour or more . i decided on one of their combos , a N . Nlb . lobster with half pound of shrimp ( crawfish were substituted out ) in " theboil ' s special sauce " . . . i have no fondness for crawfish so this was a welcome surprise . note that with the Nlbs of food ordered , this comes with corn and potatoes . win ! we also ordered cajun fries and oyster sliders . the fries come with a spicy remoulade sauce that goes well with the crunchy season fries . the sliders with the breaded oysters were fried to perfection . the goods were delivered soon ofter in an obligatory plastic bag of yumminess , opened up in front of us for us to dive in . ( here ' s a pro tip take your foodie pictures before you start digging in and then put your technology away ! you ' re welcome . ) you know when the food is fantastic when there ' s a distinct silence befallen at the table . ( this is a good thing , yes ? ) throughout service , the servers were attentive and stayed on top of everything , including water , swapping out buckets full of shells , and handing out towelettes wetnaps , which was just awesome . ( i ' m told that service may vary but it was not the case with our table . ) the boil deserves high marks , which compare favorably to the segment they represent . as a first-timer here , i am impressed and will likely be back for more . it ' s no wonder why countless new yorkers understandably wait patiently for a table here in the les . 
i don ' t drink so i can ' t comment on the bar , but i get food to-go from here quite often . i live right around the corner and industrial greenpoint is sorely lacking in quality food options . the kale salad is delicious . i wanted to like the squash salad but the roasted squash was overcooked to the point where it was black on one side . it ' s a new spot so it ' s easy to forgive some inconsistencies . i ' m not the biggest fan of their bbq sauce , but my boyfriend loves it . wings are solid , mac and cheese is delicious and the sunday brunch is a godsend for lazy days when enid ' s just seems too far . i do wish the tacos had higher quality tortillas . you can get better store-bought corn tortillas at key foods than the ones they serve , we live in a borough full of amazing tortilla factories , most of them distribute to neighborhood grocery stores . 
it took me N different trys before i was able to get a seat here but it was worth it . the food is amazing ! the daily specials are fresh and delightful . try the fig pudding for dessert . it is out of this world ! the beer and wine selection is also great . 
pizza here is definitely different ( cheese in middle and sauce on top ) . it ' s a nice quick bite and delicious as well ! definitely worth a try . 
honestly , this place should get N . N stars because the pros really out way the cons by a land slide . first of all the location couldn ' t get better as it is only a couple of feet off of times square . if anyone has eaten in this area you know that due to huge influx of tourist most restaurants charge an automatic N gratuity to your meal regardless of your party size . this high class establishment does not , impressive ! as you walk in you notice the decor , rustic modern but very much warm and welcoming . i must say though the hostess and waitresses aren ' t easy on the eyes ! my wife and i was seated fairly quickly for a busy saturday night , it seemed like they had endless sitting for them to be able to accommodate the revolving door of people walking in . even though the portions are family style the seating was not which is always a plus when you want to have romantic night out alone . the food was decadent and flavorful , you could actually taste the freshness in the seasoning . as i stated before the portions was plentyful so we ended up sharing a plate of chicken parm over penne ( three people could of eaten from this plate ) . if you order the meat over pasta it is only a N extra charge as opposed to paying N more for a side plate of pasta . the meal came out to under N with soft drinks , bread and tip . for a couple to eat for that amount of money in times square and have the quality and portions be what they were is the reason this place has now gained a loyal customer for years to come . 
i visited sabor peru ( byob ) on friday , nov . Nth , N , on the recommendation of a friend who ' s in the restaurant business . i must confess that i ' m literally crazy about peruvian cuisine , with which i ' m quite familiar from frequent visits to other peruvian restaurants in passaic , paterson , north bergen , west new york , union city and manhattan . however , nothing prepared me for the disaster that dining at sabor peru was . my friend and i ordered two dishes ( palta rellena and seafood paradise ) from a special menu ( where prices were not listed ) and another one ( fish ceviche ) from the regular menu . palta rellena , as the name suggests , consists of two halves of avocado , stuffed with chicken or shrimp salad with different garnitures . the palta we got served consisted of four slices of avocado over a mixture of iceberg lettuce , tiny dices of chicken and a huge amount of mayonnaise , garnished with a boiled egg and a single black olive . the dish was a complete departure from all the previous paltas i tasted and , at a whopping N . N , quite a rip-off . the second dish we shared was the fish ceviche , which was priced at N . N---not bad , except that the portion was about a third less than what a regular ceviche is at any other peruvian restaurant i ' ve been to . our ceviche failed miserably it was too acidic , the fish was a bit fishy , and the boiled potato , hard to the point of being inedible . the last dish sampled was the seafood paradise a mix of N fish filet , N shrimps , N mussels , N claims and several pieces of yucca . expecting the sort of mixed seafood grill described on the special menu , we got , instead , a shocking " paradise " reality check the filet was quite small and covered in sauce , the N shrimps were fried and cold , as it was the yucca , which we also found hard and of not a nice consistency . we ate very little of this dish and our indifference i ' m sure did not go unnoticed my biggest surprise came with the tab the seafood paradise was priced at N . N and the total tab for the N dishes ordered , N . the waiter who served us was also the restaurant owner . self-introduced as dave , he was friendly , but full of recommendations and praise for his peruvian food , something i found a bit patronizing and quite a turn-off . overall , my dinner at sabor peru was a disappointment . the food was not what i knew it was supposed to be , and on top of it , quite expensive . i left convinced that sabor peru aims to those for whom peruvian cuisine is only a curiosity and , unfortunately , that aim doesn ' t guarantee longevity in the tough restaurant business . if you ' re up for a truly nice experience in peruvian cuisine , skip sabor peru and go on a short drive to passaic and visit peruvian family restaurant , near the town hall . 
i have been to this p . f . chang ' s several times . i took a friend , ( who has never been there or to any p . f . chang ' s ) , to lunch today and boy , do i regret it ! ! ! ! the food was extremely salty . i had the pad thai noodle with shrimp which i have had twice in the past N months because i really liked it before . the manager informed me that they changed the recipe . it was so salty . as i can see from reading other reviews , that is not the only salty dish . the banana ' s foster with ice cream was also disappointing . it arrived mostly melted and the banana ' s were soggy and mushy as if microwaved . looked as if they tried to put in the freezer because our forks , yes forks , were ice cold . the waitress ( we started out with a waiter ) who took over our table for dessert never told us that she was taking over for our previous waiter . he just disappeared . we asked for spoons and she said they don ' t serve spoons anymore with dessert . what ? ? so here we are trying to eat this melted ice cream with a huge dinner fork . i knew i should have requested danielle . she was our waitress the past couple of times and we had no problems at all . she is friendly and outgoing . service aside , the food was so lousy and salty . everything salty ! ! ! never again ! ! ! ! i left totally embarassed by my choice to eat here ! 
average to below average sushi . the rice is a gamble whether it is appropriate or dry . fish quality is average . my real issue is the take-out packaging . flimsy containers guarenteed to smush all my rolls together into one big glob . containers also open during transportation ( from the counter to the door lol ) . the location is pleasant but don ' t expect to find parking . the inside of the restaurant is tiny ( like most sushi spots ) but clean and welcoming . 
i ' m venezuelan and i wouldn ' t be more happy to have a real " arepera " in my hood . one of the best " peluas " i ' d tasted ever . great service , clean and conceptual space . i loved it . 
i feel like i ve been had by a tourist trap . . . . my cheesesteak managed to be both dry and running with grease at the same time . i did not enjoy the experience . i should have taken an instagram of the cute retro stand and kept my ten bucks in my pocket . sidenote , cash only places piss me off . 
love this place ! probably my favorite out of all the nearby thai places i ' ve tried . i find the pad thai to be a fairly reliable indicator of a thai restaurants overall quality , and out of luscious , spice , and up thai , i find the pad thai here the best . generally the dishes here are also higher in quality and less expensive than luscious thai , and less sweet and more garlicky than spice thai . this place serves quite a nice variety of lunch specials for really cheap and it lasts all the way until N N pm , great if you ' re working long and erratic hours like me . the restaurant setting is quite nice , although inside is a little cramped and the number of tables is rather limited . probably my biggest complaint with this place is that many of the lunch specials don ' t come with rice so you have to make your own or eat without it . 
the chicken swarma sandwich is good . i like the service . 
this is my first yelp review , so here goes met up with a friend around union square , and she suggested we try ootoya . had never heard of it but apparently everyone else has because the hostess told us N - N minutes for N N thursday night ! we gave them our number anyway , not expecting anything , but sure enough the hostess called after N min and even left a courteous voicemail . happy to have waited because the food was damn good . never had japanese food sets , and seriously one of the best katsu and mackerel dishes i ' ve ever tried . and don ' t forget about the yakitori . try -chawanmushi ( who knew egg custard could be so good ? ) -tsukune ( just do it , trust me on this ) -buta aspara ( can ' t go wrong with pork belly ) -saba set ( mackerel ) server was polite , friendly , and helpful . mostly japanese staff , although the white tall guy and short asian girl ( typical nyc odd couple ) at the host ess stand didn ' t seem to speak any japanese . they still managed to keep their cool despite all the hungry people rushing their little host table . overall great service as to be expected , especially at japanese restaurants . our hostess even apologized and thanked us for waiting , not like she could control the popularity of this place . popularity and long wait time well justified
what a find ! ! this is a beautiful but out out of the way spot that gives you the impression you are dining in an international museum . it is located in the industrial part of lower east falls and germantown area . i went here for lunch with a friend , i have been to material culture many times , but but not since they added the cafe . baba olga ' s has a beautiful , cozy , dining room with artifacts for sale right you dine . . the menu is on a big board when you enter the cafe . you then place your order at the cashiers spot and have a seat and they deliver your food . the cuisine is a mixture of mediterranean , african , european and american foods . most of the food is eco friendly and very healthy . they proudly serve green friendly coffees and teas and the coffee is excellent . i had a beef short rib sandwich on a brioche bun with some sharp provolone cheese , a cup of african yam and peanut soup , and theyy rounded out my lunch with a delicious fruit salad , potato chips and pickles . my guess have a multigrain pita sandwich with hummus , roasted red peppers , roasted eggplant , and other vegetables . everything we had was excellent . before leaving i met alicia the chef . she was very warm and receptive and i enjoyed our conversation . it ' s the kind of place that you want to bring your friends to experience . i can ' t wait until i return . 
the food - great the decor - not . but the food makes up for it . there will most likely be a line if you go thursday - sunday . nothing severe however i have never waited more than N minutes . a word to the smell sensitive . do not wear clothes that you do not plan to wash before wearing again anything you wear here will smell like onions , peppers , and salsa after you leave . even with all that , i love jose tejas . 
delicious . fresh sushi . nice wait staff . some authentic bar food . i ' m glad this opened up in lic ! 
delicious ! the turkey burger is extremely juicy and all of the vegetable are local , making everything super fresh . my boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and biscuits a little too much . . . he still talks about them in a sexual way . the place tends to get busy , but go during the week and you can avoid a long wait . 
yet another yelp rating exaggeration . i had the akamaru ramen . look , here ' s the N it ' s good ramen . it is not great ramen . for N , your ramen should not only taste like no ramen you ' ve ever had , it should give you personalized dating advice for six minutes . here ' s the slurp on the ramen the flavors were good . the pork was the star . it was fatty , buttery , full of porky goodness . unfortunately , there were only two slices of it in my bowl . and truthfully , i feel like a ramen house should make a star out of the ramen , not the pork . if you name your establishment after a dish and over price the items , it should do justice to its namesake . next time , i ' m going to try rai rai ken . N for a bowl of ramen , well-reviewed , and a full house when i walked passed . 
great , fresh fish that is cooked very nicely . my big gripe is they are always out of red snapper . i ' ve tried to order it twice to no avail . they salad they provide are very good and they ' ll give the the whole , entire fish . like i said , it ' s fresh fish from the market . no sense is buying fish at the market and bringing it home to cook . just let wild edibles do the cooking . i ordered the seabass and it was great . 
delicious food , excellent service , spacious setting . i had the rack of lamb , the spread sampler for appetizer , and split rice pudding for dessert . everything was excellent ! ! would definitely come again and highly recommend . prices are fair for the quality of food and attentive but not overbearing service . 
i have been going to bove ' s since i was a young child and my father was going to college at uvm . . . it was a weekly stop for us and i still go there whenever i go to the burlington area because the food is awesome and it holds such a special place in my heart . my parents always ask to go there when we are even close to the area . 
amazing restaurant . reservations are a must unless you want to be waiting for hours . like brussel sprouts ? you ' ll love alta ' s . it ' s a brilliant dish . 
don ' t let the location ( small strip mall ) and outer appearance of this place fool you . the food is very good . i ' ve tried many dishes here and have rarely been disappointed . i always make sure to get the roti canai . it ' s not healthiest appetizer but it ' s very tasty and the dipping sauce is great . the ambiance is casual ( and pleasant ) , so i would not recommend this for a romantic dinner . but it is child friendly . 
had one of the best brunches ever here when my husband and i stumbled in by accident . i had a quiche with salad that was exactly what i wanted . good sunday place in old city . 
opening day as advertised online and around washington square park , they had N cent curry for the first N portions . the drawback was that you had to dine-in for the special . however , i ' d say the wait was completely justified because the curry was delicious , and for that price ? it reminded me of curry house back home , but less oily , which was awesome . the restaurant people were really nice , managing the crowd as best they could . i got the chicken katsu it was good not an obscene amount of breading , and the chicken was still tender . i thought my friend ' s pork katsu was a bit dry , but maybe that ' s just me . although today was promo pricing , i ' d say that the portion for the regular price is pretty good as well , considering we ' re in new york . downside for you vegetarians i think pork is used to make their curry ? or at least that ' s what i read somewhere . . . they have pretty limited seating , but i guess on regular days , it ' s a good idea to get take-out and eat it in the park since it ' s so close ( another plus ! d ) 
not worth a stop . we had a reservation but they couldn ' t find it . the venue is a bit run down , but ok . not much money being invested here . the service is slow and not very professional . the food is ok but everything else than outstanding . i had gnocchi with asparagus . there was about N N of asparagus in there . the rest was some sort of cheese . clearly not high value ingredients . all of that would have been fine if the price tag would be appropriate . ( hint it ' s too expensive ) 
went to go check out the newly remodeled tavern beer themed side . only person in the place was the owner who was sitting at bar eating . he muttered ' bartender will be here soon ' so we stood around for a few more minutes continued to be completely ignored so we left . seemed like he couldn ' t have cared any less . . . . can ' t imagine this is a good way to build a reputation . can ' t review what i never had the chance to try . won ' t be back
i enjoyed the spring rolls appetizer and learned that they are hand rolled right there . ( i just assumed they would be pre- rolled and or frozen . ) i also had the pesto fettuccine with chicken . the flavor was good , not overpowering , and the amount was very generous . i think the location is great and i am definitely going back to try something else . 
ok , for me the best bang for my buck was here at joes shanghai ! ! i found out this place was ridiculously good through a friend who frequents nyc often and loves to save money . if u can find this little hole in the wall shanghai style chinese restaurant you may have found the holy grail of dumpling spots in nyc ! first , let me just say they are famous for their dumplings with broth inside , you eat it with a spoon and chopsticks . you top it with some vinegar and soy ginger and you are set ! ! this place was absolutely packed on a wednesday and we ended up sitting at a table for six with another family of five . we didn ' t mind sharing a table because they had been here before and they drove N hours from d . c just for dumplings ! ! ! so we ordered one crab and one pork dumpling . they come N to an order and it ' s under N bucks ! ! ! we also ordered some shanghai noodles and a scallion pancake which were also out of this world good ! ! ! our total bill was under N bucks and we finished it all ! ! ! not only did the food come out really fast , they even got my gf water when she asked for it and refilled it without asking ! for me that was definitely a first in any crowded restaurant ! ! joes shanghai don ' t change a thing ! i ' m coming back soon , it ' s only a N hour flight and a jump on the N train ! ! ! 
had dinner here the other night and found it to be just a truly exceptional experience . it is a tough bill to please both carnivores and vegetarians in the same place but somehow this place just does it right . first the food we started with two apps . the cheese plate which was a choice of three different cheeses . one brie type , one bleu cheese type , and one hard type . they were all good . they came from local dairies and were unpasteurized ( really hard to find now adays ) . the three cheeses were served with wonderful sourdough points , cherry compote , and pickled veggies . . . . . truly wonderful . the second app was the chicken liver mousse . once again an amazing light very tasty dish served with different toast points , pickled veggies and a hard seed mustard . i could have ate a vat of this stuff . for our meals we went really really simple two of the burgers and one vegetarian burgers . this is perhaps the best burger i have ever eaten . the meat is locally sourced grass fed . they grind it themselves . the bun was a work of art . light fluffy with seeds and soaked up the juices of the medium rare burger . the toppings included were vermont white cheddar , maple smoked bacon , and pickled onions . this was the perfect burger in my opinion the flavors were just the bomb . my only gripe , small that it is , was that it was not a larger bun nor burger . the fries were also good and crisp and the right size . when serving the burgers they bring out N condiments their homemade ketchup , mayonnaise , hot sauce , and mustard . . . . each one was really good . the vegetarian burger was really really good as well . for dessert we shard the apple pie with vermont ice cream ( not ben and jerry ' s ) and the chocolate cake with aforementioned ice cream . only gripe from the gallery was too much frosting ' s . . . never too much frosting imho . this place is always busy and for good reason . amazing selection of beer . . . probably N on tap , and another N-N in cans or bottles . . . . . and really rare ones at that . some bottles were N-N dollars each . this place is not cheap but for what you get i would come back here over and over again for the quality of food and service . ambiance by the way is really great as well . young people , families , old people . . . . everyone just digging the drinks and food . come early or prepare to wait an hour ! ! ! ! ! check this place out ! ! ! 
good food but don ' t bother going if you only have an hour for lunch . five of us went there for lunch yesterday . although the restaurant was not crowded , we waited more than an hour just to get our food served . p . s . it ' s an italian restaurant yet they charge for bread to dip in olive oil ! we won ' t be going back there . 
another place to cross off the paypal foodie spree ! ( i had N credit to spend at that time ) --regular croissants - nice and toasted for me . it ' s hard to mess up a croissant anyways . --roast beef sandwich - surprisingly decent and large enough to be filling ! but would i pay N for it normally in midtown ? no . --white hot chocolate - avoid ! tastes just like warm vanilla milk . definitely should have gotten something else . or went to starbucks next door . while paying i found it quite odd that the person had turned their tablet around to me and on the screen was a tip option . i ' m all for tipping for excellent service when someone really goes out of their way , but just placing my orders in a bag to go ? i don ' t think so . 
i love this place for their loco tuesdays , which includes half-priced tapas plus strong and delicious happy hour drinks . they are not at all skimpy with the alcohol , and their tapas are nicely portioned - four items easily satisfied two of us . tapas i like shrimp taquitos crab cakes w mango jalapeno salsa and mixed greens platano relleno - crispy sweet plantain stuffed w slow roasted pork ( it ' s coma-inducing ) mahi mahi tacos total for food N . nice . thanks for not hurting my wallet . i ' ll see you again real soon . 
we have ordered from oregano joe ' s several times . pizza , grinders , wings . . . all exceptional ! can ' t miss here ! friendly on the phone , delivered on time , and the food was great ! as good as it gets ! 
ah , " the chicken ribs joint " . i ' ve been coming here either by myself or with my dad for about N years , mostly on tuesdays . if you think this place is a " hole in the wall " now , you should ' ve seen it N years ago . but for what it is , there ' s no better place in the area . the fried rice here is the best i ' ve ever had . it is fried and then left to steam in covered pots instead of sitting on the side somewhere or over a low light on the stove where it could dry out . so it retains its moisture while keeping some of its oily goodness . the chicken is amazing as well , especially with the green sauce . the green sauce can make anything taste great though , even mom ' s overcooked pot roast . . . that ' s saying something . what ' s great about the ribs is that they are very meaty and they use a dry rub spice , so it ' s cooked in its natural juices without the need of bbq sauce . this place also does not use msg to enchance its flavors like so many other places do . i came here with my girl and had N chicken and ribs combos , drinks , x-tra hot sauce and plaintains for N . that ' s recession proof , even with their recently inflated prices . people call me on tuesdays just to ask me if i ' m going here and can i pick them up something for them . . . . that ' s how good this place is . plus , the dvd lady comes around with all your movie needs . . . gives it a little extra charm . . . actually , that ' s why i usually order take out . . . . 
this place is utterly delicious . i ' ve been here several times , but recently i had the kani pizza which was such a burst of flavor and a much bigger plate than i had expected . if you haven ' t been here before its good to know that they only have three or four dishes that are entree sized and the rest come in small servings of three . i do not want to use the word tapas here because its not what i would refer to as a tapa . . . . but the sizing of the servings are like tapa style sizes with three of each item but moving on back to the food . . . we also had the korean bbq wraps which were also very deliciously wrapped in lettuce . . . the restaurant makes their own iced tea if you aren ' t in the mood for an alcoholic drink , but they do have an impressive list of micro brews and some really great wine choices . the only reason why i didn ' t give this place five stars is because of the fried chicken and the lychee panna cotta . . . my date and i had such a hankering for fried chicken and this was not a good fried chicken . the breading wasn ' t at all what i expected it to be and the flavors at least for me just weren ' t there . if the breading had been more crunchy this would have been a success , but the flavor and the juiciness was missing . the lychee panna cotta also was lacking the true texture of panna cotta . . . it should have been called lychee jello ( but all in all this food is awesome and well worth the visit . next time i ' ll stick to the assortment of sorbets ice creams . . those are delish
we gave this place a shot based not on the previous reviews , but on what the food looked like on diners ' plates sitting at the sidewalk dining area ! i should have trusted the reviews . . . . the food was actually ok . not spectacular and certainly not worth the money though ! service was a major miss . monday night and maybe N other tables seated inside , at least N servers and it still took N minutes for our server to acknowledge us and take our drink order . our appetizers came with our entrees , which was a huge mistake . the server checked back N minutes after we got all of our food and then i had to practically tackle her to get our drinks refilled . and then she cleared the plates before i was done eating ! there were only N other tables seated , did they really want to turn the table over that quickly ? food is typical italian fare . there is no " wow " factor to the menu - i dare say olive garden has a more authentic italian food offering - at half the cost . and olive garden has better tasting food ! the appetizer and entrees were mediocre at best , just nothing special about the food . three of us , no alcohol , no desert and over N . there are far better restaurants within walking distance , don ' t waste your money here . 
this was a gem of a restaurant we just discovered in montclair . food was excellent , moderately priced , attentive staff and owner present ( always a good sign . ) we found this by default , because the intended restaurant was closed and what a find . will return for sure , loving the food and ambience , byo a plus and just about the best we ' ve found in montclair
amazing food and friendly service . had the best gnocchi ever at this place and i frequent italian restaurants--loved this gem ! 
we stopped in hartford on our way from maine to dc . we wandered in looking for food to take back to our hotel . i cannot tell you how wonderful the staff was . we took a while to find something that our kids would want to eat ( N and N ) and the manager and hostess stood there and offered suggestions and offered to make anything they wanted . they decided on cheeseburgers from the lunch menu ( this was at dinnertime ) . they talked to us about everything from our trip to what we saw , where we live in dc , how old the kids are , etc . they told us it would be about N minutes for our food so they gave us complimentary water bottles so we could walk around hartford while we waited . when we got back , our food was ready and they threw in cheesy garlic bread and a huge bag of biscotti at no charge . the food was excellent and i cannot say enough about the staff . supremely awesome ! 
est N your host is pat custode . rated N pizza in the essex county area . sandwiches N star salads N star thin or thick crush pies . ( i like thick ) located on restaurant row in nutley , nj sorry no del service . 
if visiting philadelphia and you want to get the philadelphia local vibe , pat ' s ( and italian market ) is really a great place . as it is not categorized as a yelp tourist point of interest , but a restaurant , i will base the balance of my review on pat ' s as a place to eat . it ' s popularity and fame are based on the past . there are many places to get really great cheese steaks in philadelphia . different businesses will often have a specific reason theirs is best ( the meat , the bread , the cheeses , etc ) . pat ' s reason to visit is the history . once upon a time this was indeed the definitive place for a great steak sandwich . the competition is pretty tough in philly and pat ' s has not really kept pace . nothing wrong with sticking with the original or classic , but the sub you will actually eat from pat ' s will not live up to the great sub you hope you will get and could get elsewhere . they try to pawn off their abrupt and rude service as philly charming . no , it is just out of touch customer service . the serving size is lower end of average compared to what you get throughout the city . meat is pretty good , not phenomenal . the cheese is towards the bottom of the list . the roll is decent . overall , that adds up to a N star " meh , i ' ve experienced better " review . they make decent steak hoagies subs here . they just do not belong on a foodie ' s best of philadelphia lists . it is an old recipe that has not kept pace with changes in the market . depending on what you think most important in a steak sandwich , you will find better . if you have no single item that is most important and just want an overall great steak sandwich , you can do better in that way , too . pat ' s best is really the entry level steak sandwich standard nowadays . most every decent place serving steak sandwiches offer a quality comparable to , or better than , pat ' s . 
i waited N minutes for a seat here and was told it would be worth it . it was . just the best ramen i ' ve ever had . i ' m no connoisseur , but damn . . . so rich and flavorful ! i just wanted to put a straw in the broth and drown my worries in it . and i can ' t even begin to describe the pork buns . . . wow ! it would have been better to experience it with my fianc though . such greatness is best shared . 
kinda weird that i haven ' t reviewed this place yet considering i basically live there . any beer you ' re looking for , you can get at bottle bar . the bartenders are great , the food is great -- daily grilled cheese specials ! hell yeah ! the only thing is that it ' s going to run you upwards of N bucks to get a takeout six pack , and i wish there were more tables . 
whiskey is my drink of choice , and as you could guess village whiskey has them all . great atmosphere to go relax , sip a fine whiskey or scotch , and talk with the local crew . the burgers get all the attention they deserve , and yes , they are on the pricey side , but you knew that before you walked in . it ' s garces , you pay , he delivers . -john wiederman
what does a pissed off person who hasn ' t received their food at N pm . . . over an hour after they ordered get up to ? yelp that this place sucks . if the nachos aren ' t a slice of heaven i am going to effing lose it . . . . how does it take an hour to make nachos . at Npm . on a wednesday . you aren ' t that popular . here are all the places you should try before ordering from here la esquina tacombi taqueria diana . . . or any of the other N places on seamless that make mexican-style food . 
it ' s what you ' d expect . amazing location , ambience and d cor . solid food and service . 
first trip to ny and got a collection of recommendations to get " representative ny food " from a bunch of different ny expats . all of them said to hit grimaldis . no sh t sherlock ! ! ! one of the greatest pies i ' ve had to date . the crust was thin and it had like " islands " of stuff on it rather than a homogeneous mixture of toppings . i don ' t know how to describe it other than that . i ' ve had the best from chicago ( lou malanatis , unos due ' s , etc ) and although i think i still prefer the deep dish , this is an entirely different animal - clearly the best food i had in ny and i would return on any given day . note hit this place before it opens . we went by on a monday night about N and the line to get into this place was N N down the block ( no exaggerating there , i swear ! ) . we skipped it that night and hit the place for lunch on tuesday N N hour before they opened and we got right in when they opened their door . pizzas were out in like N-N minutes
pricey but good . . . keep in mind i ' m from oc la so cal so price is relative . but the flavors were good and the options are good . noodles cooked right . soup base tasty but not over powering or salty . service and atmosphere was good too . 
revolting . cold food , only resembling pizza in appearance . don ' t even think of trying a salad unless you have a particular desire for sand with your salad . god only knows if they even try to wash the veggies . generally filthy quarters and if you ' ve the trained eye ( and the stomach ) for it , you can watch the folks who make the pizza violate N-N sanitary rules within N-N minutes . awful . utterly , unbelievably awful . 
i came there mainly for the dessert which i really liked . d non alcoholic loosey goosey pomegranate-orange , ginger beer , jack rudy grenadine . as i don ' t drink alcohol , i am always pleased when a restaurant has some non alcoholic beverage on their menu . bread and butter the butter was so white and creamy , and i like that it was easy to spread . fennel barigoule confit walnuts , figs , arugula goat cheese . the fennel were cooked with a nice crunchy texture . summer vegetable tartine gruyere , mustard , garlic aioli served with pommes frites cornichons . this dish a lot heavier than i though with the melted gruyere and the grilled vegetables ( eggplant , fennel , red pepper , zucchini ) . the fries were good accompanied with the aioli . olive oil cake creme fraiche , peaches basil . i always love olive oil cake . it ' s not too sweet and it seemed to have a pleasant savory flavor . the peaches were refreshing . they have a nice outdoor space . 
i have eaten at delorenzo ' s since i was a kid before the cops patrolled at the hudson street location . very happy they opened this beautiful store . so worth the wait . for a family of N we eat two pizzas there and take two home everytime . we just can ' t get enough . sam is always friendly , and busy . we like to eat there as the pizza is so much better fresh out of the oven . love the old time pics that are hanging in the new store . this is not your average pizza place , this place is exceptional ! be prepared to wait - it ' s worth it ! 
we had a great time at dinner last . my girlfriends took me out for my birthday . we all enjoyed our meals and had leftovers to take home . the owner and staff were very attentive and friendly and brought out dessert ( the cappucino ice cream cake is amazing ) and sang to me . i will definitely go back . 
very friendly service ) 
as part of keith mcnally ' s empire , i prefer balthazar over pastis , they ' re both tourists hangouts , but in balthazar there ' s less sex and the city trash and they have an awesome raw bar . don ' t expect anything amazing , they have a formula and the formula works like a swiss watch . 
surfish was a relatively pleasant surprise . the size of their tapas is impressive - we had to cancel one of our entrees as a result . the ribs are served with an exotic peanut sauce that was delicious . we also ordered the pork sliders which were the highlight of the entire meal . brussel sprouts were overcooked unfortunately , and the rotisserie duck ( which was a special ) was on the dry side , but the rice that it was served with was out of the world . definitely going back to explore the menu further . 
we all loved it ! the service was excellent , and the food was delicious . my braised octopus appetizer was one of the best things i ever ate ! the pasta was perfect . my only complaints were the over-priced cocktails and the volume of the noise - the background music made conversation difficult . 
italian ristorante emporio was opened in april of this year . it ' s located on quiet mott street and surrounded by chic little boutiques for the hipster crowd . i went for lunch yesterday . loved the ambiance - warm lighting old , wooden tables skylight in the back room . the hostess was wonderful ( and italian , which makes the experience feel oh so much more authentic ! ) and everything we asked for came beautifully prepared , fresh , and quickly to our table . the antipasto salad of fava beans , pea shoots , mint , and pecorino cheese was a small , lush , green mountain of juicy crunchiness on a plate . the pecorino added a pleasant umph to the sweet melody of the pea shoots and fava beans that harmonized together on my tongue . the dark olive oil that came with the fresh bread was spicy and deeelish . la pizza margherita had wonderful flavor but not enough volume - too flat for my taste ! wonderful in its crunchiness , but pales in comparison to le pizze di spacca napoli . but still , for pizza servita in america , e ' buona . my fave was the pasta pictured above . the mozzarella di buffala fluffy , flavorful , fresh . the eggplant vellutato ( velvety ) , succoso ( juicy ) . the tomatoes and the homemade pesto deliziosi . . . all together with the tonnarello fatto in casa ( homemade ) , una bella cosa was created . un espresso poured over gelato vaniglia ( as they say in italy un affogato , which means " drowned " ) alla fine of the meal was perfect . i ' d go back any day . a presto ! for pictures and more , go to my foodgirl site ! spiritualityoffood . com
let ' s cut to the chase . let ' s call wolf and deer what it is -- a place named ( erroneously ) after the proprietors ' offspring . now . . . hear me out . . . i may have made that part about the name of the place up , and if so , i apologize . i ' m not very smart . what i do know is that wolf and deer is also a lovely place for small plates , fantastic cocktails , great wine selection ( from which we have yet to partake in our two visits ) , and perfect customer service -- with an emphasis on " perfect . " we ' ve been here twice during peak-ish times , and felt like welcome guests to this cozy space each time . i hope word doesn ' t get out too much about how great wd is , but i wish them great success . . . so i can keep coming back for the meat and cheese plates , pickles , and delicious libations . next stop is their sandwiches , which also look ridiculously good . 
our family loves this bakery for special occasions . they will make lactose free and gluten free pastries . they have made my beautiful lingerie bridal shower cupcakes . they are currently working on another masterpiece for me ( custom made ) for two birthdays . 
i don ' t know the exact number of restaurants the city has to offer , what i do know is that yerbabuena is one of those places where you always feel at home . we had our wedding in the city and decided to stop by and toast with a couple of " poquito picantes " that is their best drink and our favorite so do yourself a favor and try it ! ! don ' t be afraid if by reading the cocktail menu you think you are about to drink a salad , the flavor ' s that this drink have will blow your mind away . the food was an outstanding mix of traditional latin food with a gourmet twist , just the right amount of spices and even if you are not used to spicy food i promise you that the explotion of flavor ' s that your mouth will experience will take your mind back home wherever that may be . if you are in the mood for a latin american tour without living the city go ahead and try their whole menu as you will find a mix of cultures combined in a fantastic way from mexico ' s fish taco ' s to a succulent rib eye steak from argentina and do not miss a moqueca ( a brazilian paella ) the ceviche from peru will go perfect with a pisco sour that not even in peru you will be able to taste . the service was amazing as always , the super friendly will made us feel right at home so i am sure you will experience the same type of treatment thank you gio and mario for making our special day beyond anything we expected . it was soooo good we didn ' t want to leave , thanks again guys and we will see you soon . jfa
terrible service . worst dining experience ever . stay away . 
i took my family for an early dinner here . they enjoyed every morsel . i ordered the beet carapaccio , the roasted chicken entree and the chocolate pudding . it was solid . my brother was satisfied with his snapper and my date loved his shortribs . the staff was friendly and attentive , even though i wore flip flops and a tank top ( totally under dressed ) , but they put me at ease . highly recommend . 
culin ria tradicional americana . por es generosas , atendimento frio por m eficiente . excelente custo benef cio . recomendo o pastrami cheeseburger . 
to be honest i didn ' t find it memorable . it was good enough , but it didn ' t blow my mind either . sorry , faithfuls ! 
this place rocks one of the best pizzas in ct plus good service . nothing is better than sitting outside west hartford center in the summer eating good pizza . 
too long a queue for cue ( slower than fette sau actually ) . brisket was good . sausages are decent . ribs not so much . on a lazy slow saturday it ' s worth checking out . otherwise pass . 
i had the misfortune to visit this establishment with a friend to see the second half of the usa v belgium world cup match . the match was being shown on a big screen with spanish commentary . we ordered two bottles of heineken but had to make do with two smaller bottles of eefs , turkish beer . we had a further one beer each before heading for a real bar , the parlour on Nth st to watch the period of extra time . we were charged just under N . N for four bottles of eefs . exhorbitant ? i think so . rip off ? definitely ! i will not be back but i will enjoy telling this story . shame on you vino levantino . 
holy god damn shit jane , i am in love . i think this place could alone justify rent in soho . all you need to know is that every brunch entree comes with an awesome complementary cocktail and two people can feast and drink for under N after tip . need i say more ? okay i will , benedict johnny , take your standard eggs benedict and make it anything but with corn pancakes , roasted tomato hollandaise and house made maple chicken sausage . k , that should do . go . 
i paid N . N for an eggs florentine , fries and salad ! ! what a great deal-cash only , fyi ! ! the eggs were super filling and the fries were so nice and crispy ! ! my friend had the pancakes which were really fluffy yet crispy at the same time-delicious ! ! we sat outside on a lovely warm day . the tables are really close to others so be prepared to have people listen in on your convo , haha ( or the other way around ! ) . 
bill i come here often . bill says they have the best wings ! they ' re fresh -not frozen ! i love the pulled pork quesadillas ! the bud light is always so cold ! all good things ! and kaitlyn marla are an awesome team ! great service -always with a smile ! 
there is not much to review about amada when the food , service and ambiance of this place speaks for itself . it is amongst one of the best restaurants in philadelphia . if there was something more than a N star this place is the one which deserves it the most . their food portions are perfect , the salads are to die . most of the dishes are well thought n well presented . a must for every local and visitor to go n enjoy this amazing place . 
i have been going here as long as i was able to sit on the heating unit next to the pay phone , and it is still top notch . i have eaten cheese steaks all over the country ( not sure why i even bother , aside from always holding out hope that i won ' t be totally disappointed ) and by far the cheese steak w sauce and fried onions and the cheese steak hoagie w mayo are N of the most delicious sandwiches in the world , and yes i did say world . the way they mix the onions in w their delicious meat , cover the meat w the american cheese ( or whatever cheese you prefer ) then place the roll over top so the cheese is ooey gooey heaven , is what makes this the best cheese steak i have ever had the honor of devouring . i also love a good hot pepper and here they have choices , and i like choices . they have cherry peppers , banana peppers and dried hot peppers on the counter . 
the waitress at night is incredibly rude . she invites her friends for a drink even tonight the establishment has closed . she is against policy and morals . 
i ate here on my last trip to new york last month and i was pleasantly surprised . not only did they have my favorite belgian beer but also the matching glass with it . this was the first time i had ' hopus ' in new york ! the waitress served it perfectly and when she opened it , it popped like a champagne cork like it should . the crevettes where awesome and the mussels where great too ! everybody from the staff was really friendly and helpful with all our needs . i am definitely going back on my next trip so i can try some more of their eclectic beer selection . 
i love this place . mini cachapas is a great way to start your meal . 
terrible service . spilled beer on my friend , spilled coffee on me and then we overheard the waitstaff making fun of our reaction to this . they did bring N over to cover dry cleaning when they heard my friend complaining that her now beer soaked pants were dry clean only - but where in nyc can you dry clean pants for N . worst part was them talking about us like some little high school children . so unprofessional . waters were never filled . waitress had to be flagged down to even bring the check . oh and the food was not good ! the location in chelsea market is great but this location seems like a totally different restaurant . don ' t bother . 
arusuvai chettinad indian restaurant is an oasis in the north brunswick-south brunswick area . many other indian restaurants that start of serving good food to attract the diners soon deteriorate in food quality for the greed to increase their profits . but this is not the case with arusuvai . i love indian food and as a frequent diner at indian restaurants in the new york and new jersey areas i have experienced consistent food quality and choice at arusuvai . moreover their prices are reasonable giving good value for your money . arusuvai has kept its promise of home-style cuisine and they deliver it with a smile . at arusuvai you get a good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes including even fish curry or crab masala . and their sambar is done just like how my mother makes and is very delicious . i am not biased . i have taken my friends to arusuvai and they are very pleased with the food quality , service and reasonable prices . though , they may want to re-work their chicken briyani . except for this i enjoy all their other dishes . i was at arusuvai on mother ' s day and am i glad that i made the right choice . i heard of horror stories at one other indian restaurant in north brunswick ( the name i will not mention here ) where they raised their prices for mother ' s day buffet and cut back on the food choices . this was not case at arusuvai . even during the busy mother ' s day buffet , arusuvai was able to manage the diners ' palate . they refilled the food as quickly as the diners were consuming them . no one had to wait more than a few minutes . another important thing for me is the cleanliness of the dinnerware . arusuvai provides clean dinner plates , cutleries and drinking glasses . i would recommend arusuvai to anyone who wants to experience traditional and authentic indian cuisine . great food and service at reasonable prices and kids eat free ! indian food lover
great service and yummy pies ! i will definitely be returning . the sauces are also delish ! 
i ' m going to keep this short and sweet - the exact opposite of terroir ' s N page menu ! overall a solid N . N stars . i rounded up because of the great service . the wine selection was great . lebanese wine on the menu is always a plus in my book . the food was good ( get the meatballs ! ) , but the portions were small . we had to go through N rounds of ordering ( and several bottles of wine ) before we quit . anyway , besides the menu , this place is chill . a nice solid place if you ' re in the area but not worth a trip across town . . . 
this place was great . the wait was insane , the place was packed , we had to practically check people up against the walls to get a table and were breathing in thick black smoke the whole time we were there , but the pizza ( plain with abundant amounts of basil freshly snipped all over the top ) was delicious . but N for a regular sized , N-slice pie ? sorry , i don ' t care what ingredients you ' re using , that ' s way too much money for a pizza . regardless , it was real tasty , and despite the hefty price tag i would return . so i guess that says something ! 
came hoping for italian food , but the downstairs restaurants were packed . for some reason , the hosts could not give us an accurate wait time and instead told us to go upstairs to the bar . the bar had good beer but a very small selection of italian foods - no pizzas or pastas . the food was okay - nothing special . i ' d recommend shopping at eatily , and maybe having a glass of wine and cheese downstairs , but there are better , cozier italian restaurants all over the city . 
awesome food . in particular their pancakes and homefries are the best around . 
even if i don ' t have the best experience eating out , i ' m not the sort of person who feels inclined to pan a restaurant . i ' ve certainly never been moved to write a review , let alone post one online . until now . the dinner we had at catfish last night was underwhelming , unappetizing , and frankly , not that cheap . hence , the following review . we arrived at catfish around N N on a monday night . since it was on the late side for dinner , it was understandable that the restaurant had run out of some of its main dishes . but only being able to offer half the dishes on the menu was a surprise . i had hoped to try the roasted chicken with biscuits and green beans , the bbq pulled pork on brioche , the jambalaya , or the roast beef po ' boy . i even could have gone for the alligator bayou burger . but no dice . i ' m surprised we ' re still open , our server told us in a moment of candor . finally we both decided on the catfish po ' boy -- in part because we were told the fish was local-ish , from a virginia farm . but much to our disappointment , there was only one filet left . so it would be one catfish po ' boy then . i settled on an order of gumbo . though the dish seemed overpriced at N , it promised crab , andouille sausage , shrimp , vegetables , rice and a baguette . i also ordered a side of biscuits since no southern meal is truly complete without them . then we waited , sipping our very reasonably priced bourbon . we should have stuck to the spirits . because when the catfish po ' boy arrived , it was cold and lacked flavor . the fish -- which was grilled perhaps , certainly not fried -- was a little slimy in texture and stuffed in a giant baguette . a heavy , pungent smokiness pervaded the soupy gumbo , leading us to think this must have been the dregs of the pot . i could not find a single bit of crab in my bowl , just a few lonely pieces of shrimp and andouille sausage . the biscuits were hot but more like dinner rolls or scones -- as one earlier reviewer mentioned -- and had no lightness or flakiness to them . the sweet whipped butter that accompanied them seemed out of place . perhaps we had an especially bad experience . but to be on the safe side , i recommend ordering only from the bourbon list , which actually does include several good southern whiskeys . give the food a pass . 
wow ! excellent pastrami and brisket in bed-stuy ! not only is the food excellent , the prices make going to other parts of the N boroughs unnecessary to get your brisket on ! someone , somewhere posted about the neighborhood being " scary " -- be scared and stay away , more pastrami , brisket , etc . . for those of us in the know ! ! ! 
dammmmmmmn ! this place is hella good ( and cheap ) . my family and i ate a frenzy of dumplings for N . seriously , we had enough for one more person . the steamed pork pork and chives , shrimp and cabbage , and pan fried pork and chives dumplings were absolutely delicious ! it ' s particularly yummy when it comes to you steaming hot and full of juices when you bite into them . i could eat this every day ! ! ! 
a cozy environment with very nice food . the dessert was also amazing ! 
food is great ! customer service ? not so much . they didn ' t even have the decency of checking on my husband and me after they served food . wasn ' t asked for water once and not even if i wanted anything else . i would understand if it was busy , but it wasn ' t . meh . i ' ve experienced better . 
definitely a great place to have authentic viet food . spicy and hot noodle traditional made , great price also . 
i ' m going to have to come back to this review one day when i have a little more time but rat ' s is an overall fantastic restaurant ! the food is top notch and the decor is so fun and classy . the service was very , very leisurely which some people won ' t like , but if you aren ' t in a rush and truly want to enjoy a nice , relaxing meal this is the place to go . 
i stopped in for dinner with my husband one evening , dinner was great . i went back with a friend for lunch a few days later , and breakfast another few days after that . each time was better than the next . . . i was never disappointed . the food was tasty , and fresh . the presentation always appealing . this was a dining " experience " , more than just a meal . i found my new favorite restaurant . 
legitimate texas style bbq and cheaper than a trip to lockhart ( but just barely ) . i could be picky in a more detailed comparison but i won ' t because i ' m happy to have a place that reminds me of smitty ' s , only N minutes away from my home . i do have to take off N star for the slaw with the odd mix of mayo and sesame oil ( am i tasting it right ? ) , and the lack of raw onion and pickled jalapenos - which as every texas bbq lover knows , are required accompaniments . 
i tried this place for the first time . N for N hamburgers , N cheeseburgers , N bags of chips , and N sodas . the sign indicates that the burgers would be medium rare unless you request well done . the gimmick is that you can ' t use ketchup . we waited for N minutes for our food and the burgers were medium well and dry . further , the cheeseburgers had cheeze whiz , not cheese . that should be made clear . overall , in my opinion this place survives on its heritage and gimmick , certainly not by serving good food ! 
by far my favorite wine bar on the ues . the food is always amazing , the outdoor seating in the back is beautiful and the outdoor seating up front is nice for dinner as well . after trying the other neighborhood wine bar , i truly appreciate the food , service , and wine at uva . 
the only r reason this is not five stars is because every time i come here , the service is slower than those dsl turtles . expect to wait , but if you ' re sitting outside with your friends , enjoying a hoegardden in the sun , waiting is just fine . the food is pretty damn good . you can ' t go wrong munching on the hand-cut fries . and at lunch i recommend the " chicken salad sandwich grilled chicken , diced apricots red onion on raisin walnut bread served w a house salad , N " 
this may be my new favorite place in downtown . don ' t be fool this is not your average irish pub ! yeah sure you can get sheppard ' s pie and fish and chips but the chef uses ingredients that you would find in french , latin , italian and american dishes as well . braised short ribs , duck confit , rissotto sides dishes a pasta dish with chicken and a smoked gouda cream sauce . . . . . who would have thought ! ! i went with a steak special . N . N for a Noz steak smootherd with grilled onions and shallots and a sauce that i can ' t remember but it made my mouth water ! ! all in all i was so happy that we stopped in . we even splurged for dessert , the creme brulee . it was perfect ! ! nice and creamy with great orange flavor . all in all a great experience
the food , the beer . . . this place was fabulous ! and i had the hangover to prove it ! 
pretty good food and decent prices . overall , good experience until the host came over to tell us that we didnt leave enough tip- really ? ? was not that great of a place and we won ' t be returning ! 
love the mole , was just like being in puebla mexico , the guacamole as well . decor is nice and simple and the staff super friendly . 
my favorite restaurant and has been for years . i have never gotten anything less than excellence . we have used both this and he second location for large parties and all of our guests always rave about the food . highly recommend ! 
we chose to do the N course price fixe menu and it was wonderful . we walked out satisfied with the quantity of food , many times with price fixe menu we are not . the food was delicious especially the marrow bone with scallops , a very unique dish . the food is a blend of mainly italian with mediterranean influences . the service was impeccable . decor was simple but elegant . 
was great . showed up saturday afternoon and only waited N minutes . food was amazing and portions large . great food at a great prince and excellent waitstaff . 
i love this place ! it ' s always so packed and most tables are always reserved ! right before the gates open at around Npm , people are already waiting outside just eager to go in ! there are couple of drinks that are on happy hour and all the hh drinks are all N . i always go for the lychee martini . although i am allergic to the lychee , it ' s just still so flavorful , when you have about N , you ' ll start to feel it . i also had the hh bloody mary . whoah the bloody mary was one tough drink . i wasn ' t fancied by it much . the asian tapas are worth ordering ! delicious ! from the crispy calamari to the spring rolls . it ' s a very chill relaxing atmosphere . it can get quite loud with the music and dark in here ! 
i only eat here once in a long while but now probably won ' t go back . the last time i was there i noticed the person handling my food was using his bare hands . i stood there and watched him for a minute and then spoke up and alerted the guy behind the counter who then said something to the guy handling the food . instead of putting on gloves , he grabbed a fork ( implying to me that he was not going to put on gloves at all ) . this was all after i saw the food handler come up from the basement touching all kinds of dirty surfaces and not washing his hands before touching my food . 
while the beer selection is second to ( almost ) none and the decor is very much in line with my taste , the food is just a little too lackluster to keep me coming back for anything other than a quick beer . for instance , the last time i was at the restaurant the table ordered some friend calamari and a pizza to start . the calamari was just this side of rubbery and the pizza was just " ho hum " . in a city where some of the best pizza in the world is served , you might want to step up your game or just not offer it . for my dinner i ordered the sirloin steak medium rare . when it came out it was cooked between well done and hockey puck . i told my waiter and they brought me out another one . . . . ten minutes later . i understand that anyone can make mistakes and i would be more forgiving if the steak come out just a little overcooked but to go from medium rare to not a shred of pink in the whole thing , i am much less inclined to chalk it up to a simple error . and while this was one instance i am describing , it has happened more than once to me . but the beer selection and the knowledge about beer will definitely bring me back in . if you are into beer and can stomach just okay food , this is your place . 
i love italian food . it is , by far , my favorite kind of food . even more than filipino food ( but i hate most filipino food anyway since my mom says i ' m adopted ) . a few of us had made plans to come here this past week . by the time the evening came around , it was down to two . and you know what ? it was probably better that way , because we weren ' t crowded in , unlike alot of the other patrons . and most of all , lord knows i love dining with people who are much better looking than myself . i got here early , and the owner was nice enough to get me a chair from a table and allow me to sit by the front door . he even offered me a drink , but i said i ' d wait . another woman , whom i believe is also an owner , came by to check on me as well , which was nice . so finally my friend arrives and we order . i got the lasagna with meat sauce and my friend ordered the asparagus ravioli . we order , and within five minutes the food was on the table . it was hella quick . what i loved about the food was that it was real authentic italian food . it ' s not the type that you ' re going to get at olive garden . this is the kind that you ' re likely to find somewhere in little italy . and what i also loved is that whenever a dish came out of the kitchen , many patrons would stop talking to each other and look to see what dish it was . i know the table next to us kept looking at our food . for dessert i ordered the tiramisu . i even told the waiter that i didn ' t need the menu , just get me the tiramisu . and it was quite good , but apparently i ordered the regular tiramisu and not the amaretto tiramisu . oh well , there ' s always next week . i mean , what ? 
you must try the cheesesteak pizza . out of this world by far the best pizza ive ever had ! ! ! ! ! 
legit ! ! ! i ' m from ca and just visited this spot for one meal . loved it ! ! really cool spot , good ambiance , great drinks , flavorful food , and good music ! ! their pork bun appetizer is awesome , calamari is legit , but their pork belly entree is ridiculous ! ! great flavors and good fusion . i thought the ambiance is really cool and welcoming and it ' s a great spot to eat with friends before going out . good job ! 
f geno ' s , f pat ' s and f jim ' s ! seriously ! go to ishkabibbles ! they actually mix in the fixings you want in with the meat so each bites get a bit of everything . they also cook up the mushrooms and bell peppers with your meat so it ' s not cold out of a can ( yuck for jim ' s ) . they have good fries options too ! quality bread compared to other joints and you don ' t feel like you ' re walking through an assembly line . when back in philly , i ' ll get my cheesesteak fills here at ishkabibble ' s ! 
food so good it must be shared ! i was greatly surprised by this place . i had been going to nyc for years and never heard of it . they have several locations , but we went to the one in the theater district area . it ' s a big restaurant right on times square , near the hard rock cafe . it draws large crowds and you always have to wait to be seated , which is almost the rule in that area . there s a huge bar where you can order a bottle of house wine ( pinot grigio for us ) and they ll give you the bottle and the glasses you need while you wait to be seated . if you have a reservation you don ' t have to wait , but on weekends it gets packed . but , let me tell you it s worth the wait ! all the dished are for sharing and good for at least three or four people . ours was a party of five and we ordered the cold antipasto as appetizer . here came a big plate with an assortment of cold italian cuts ( prosciutto , salamis , coppa , smoked pork loin , etc . ) , caprese salad , mushrooms , olives , calamari , eggplant , and zucchini sott ' olio , rugula , peperonata , assorted italian cheeses grissini , and otherkind of bread . as an entr e , we ordered the mixed seafood pasta ( white sauce ) which was huge and delicious , and for dessert we had the strawberry shortcake . we left pretty full , portions are definitely big ! being of italian descent , we were so pleased with the food that we went back the next day . this time , we had the hot antipasto ( eggplant and zucchini parmigiana , mozzarella sticks , garlic mushrooms , etc ) , and the clam pasta ( also white ) . the seafood pasta was better than the clam pasta , but they were both worth ordering . the staff is attentive and helpful . i m sure i ' ll be back there pretty soon ! ! ! thebilingualtraveler . blo 
oh my how i love italian , and this was a standard northeast corridor italian joint with good food and real pasta . . . in other words , greatness ! i came here for a rehearsal dinner , and was pretty impressed with the service and the food . it ' s always tough to wait on people when a N top sits down ( even when you know they ' re coming ) , but all of us had everything we needed and in good time . there was plenty of vino on the table when we sat down , and i loved the homey atmosphere of the place . our prix fixe meal was a decent salad , a good pasta course with legit sauce , a choice of entree which begat me a pretty good chicken parmigana . . . and some unreal desserts . they brought us a tray of several of their offerings , and t the tiramisu was absolutely delicious . believe me , i shoved quite a few options down my already overfull gullet . i don ' t know if it ' s the water , or just the access to much better bakeries in this area . . . but the italian desserts when i come back to philly are always better than home . there ' s nothing about this place that ' ll jump out at you , but that doesn ' t mean it isn ' t delicious anyway . i ' m a big fan , and am glad to have found a place down by the water as a great jumpoff point for a night out either on south street or in penns landing . 
soondubu holds a special place in our hearts - always has and always will . aside from so kong dong in fort lee , bcd is one of the other korean places that makes a solid soondubu . we ordered the mushroom soondubu and the curry soondubu . they did not ask us about the preferred spiciness level , but managed to get it just right anyway with the mushroom soondubu . i would recommend this for meat lovers too , the mushrooms really lend such a great flavor and texture to this dish . i don ' t recommend the curry soondubu , it tasted as odd as it sounds . banchans are pretty good , but i would ' ve loved to see some fishcake mixed in there too . service is lickety-split quick and there is a slight language barrier if you are not korean . feeble pronunciation attempts , pointing and nodding made up the majority of our communications and interactions . 
i went to brunch here with N other ladies , and we really enjoyed our time here . we came here for brunch on a sunday , and it really wasn ' t crowded at all . there were probably only a couple other tables in there . the place itself isn ' t that big , but it has a nice feel to it ( not too overly themed out or anything ) . we each got an alcoholic beverage ( i got the smoky jalapeno margarita ) . it was ok . not spicy at all . i tried someones cucumber margarita ( that was recommended to her ) , and it tasted identical to mine . not sure why , but that gives you an idea of how the margarita was . i ordered the huevos mestizos , and it was quite delicious . it was a large portion size , and very flavorful . everybody seemed to really enjoy their food as well . throughout our meal , the service was good . he made good recommendations , and was on top of things . the food was good , the drinks subpar . i hear they have a good happy hour , so i may be interested in coming back to give them a chance to redeem themselves on our not so impressive drinks . but with the competition out there , we ' ll just have to see . 
first time here , based on the reviews i decided to check it out for a late night snack . pizza is a surprisingly big deal in ct , and jimmies lives up to the hype . i got the special , which was N slices of cheese soda for N . N , great deal ! the slices were a little smaller than i expected ( docked N star ) , but they were absolutely delicious and also filling ! high quality ingredients , deliciously crunchy crust , freshly made sauce and cheese , all around great ! service was excellent too , prompt and courteous . will be back ! 
a wonderful experience all around ! the restaurant has an amazing atmosphere and the food is beyond delicious . i especially recommend the oysters ! loved going for drinks after dinner in the neighborhood but could have stayed at county all night . it is the kind of place where you want to spend your entire evening , taking your time enjoying each dish and the company of the ones you are with . 
great selection of beer at good prices and nice looking restaurant with decent ambiance . that said , after three dining experiences , i ' ll simply direct the reader to the first sentence of this review . . 
what an experience ! took my family here when they came to visit from long island . great choices on the menu , authentic and delicious . the happy hour options are unbeatable for the area too . johanna was the perfect server , explained everything with a great smile and made sure we had a wonderful time . definitely a needed change of pace and somewhere i will be coming back to . 
i just saw that i was contacted by this restaurant , asking me to change my rating . i have not reviewed often but that was a first for me . the restaurant informed me that tuna nicoise neither has hericot vert nor potato . . . ( that it is made that way just for tourists . . . not been my experience , even in the small village in south of france where i had it first ) . as i said , the place was packed with folks eating crepes , and the service ( otherwise ) lovely , so i would say to check it out . . . 
loved it ! excellent tender crust , fresh toppings , really great taste . a little pricier than we expected - N for a N inch pie - but i guess you ' re paying for the imported ingredients and that amazing oven . salads also really good . tiramisu fresh and wonderful . great , efficient , friendly service too . we drive anywhere for great pizza and this didn ' t disappoint . next time we ' ll each order our own pies though . . . N slices of such goodness is too good to be shared . size and price is really what made me consider N stars instead of N . . . on taste alone , totally a N . we ' ll be back . 
can i get a cheese wiz with pleaseeeee ! ! i ' ve never been to philly and was lucky enough to go for a weekend . my boyfriend was raving about pats and said we must go . we ordered cheese fries and two steaks with cheese wiz and onions . let ' s just say that i ' m super glad that i got to try it out and will definitely go back for another one ! five stars ! ) 
came off the train hungry and thirsty at N N pm me and two other customers in the place on a tuesday afternoon . i ordered a beer and asked for a menu N minutes later with N staff members bullshitting behind the bar no one asked for my order just bullshitting . i took a twenty out of my pocket then the girl asked if i wanted another beer i said no paid for my beer and left hungry went to wendy ' s . good job waiting room . 
waited and wondered what would take over the old oliva space . . . thrilled to have a mediterranean option in the lower east side . a versatile spot for a date , people-watching , group of friends , or solo at the bar . cocktail list - innovative well-executed . try the cocktail with arak ! or the moroccan tea . bartender is spot on with descriptions and recommendations . try all the meze plates ! fresh ingredients flavorful ! favorites include spicy amba pickeled vegetables , eggplant cavier , falafel buns , lamb meatballs , and charred octopus salad ( which was not overpriced and cooked to perfection ! ) they are generous with the bread , and service is attentive but not looming . save room for dessert - the halva dessert is amazing ! a plus open til midnight weekdays and Nam on weekends . 
attended a private party at lunello ' s for a N yr old ' s birthday . it was quite the experience . we were in the ' wine cellar ' down stairs . the room had a comfortable feel , as if you were in someone ' s home . started off with cocktails , then had a few wine bottles brought out . i started with thier roasted beet salad , and for my entree i had the chicken alla taverna . roasted chicken breast with brocolli and some amazing mashed potatoes . everyone in the group of N enjoyed their meals . one person raved about the mushroom soup she started with . service was outstanding . everyone had a great time . they have a private parking lot , valet parking . i didn ' t get to check out the rest of the restaurant or bar
if you have the patience to tolerate the long prospect heights hipster yuppie queue ( who undoubtedly love the ' irony ' of the place ) to get into tom ' s , then you will be happily surprised to find the best breakfast diner you could ever ask for . all you really need to know about tom ' s is that the owner is a super-kind man , and the workingclass breakfast offerings are superb . top that off with the fact that this is probably the last place within light years of park slope that still knows how to make a real brooklyn egg cream ( cue nasal yuppie voice " what ' s even in those ? " ) , and you ' ve got a sleepy hangover heaven . 
i somehow missed the fact that burger box is at washington park once a week . it ' s really sad to think of all of those wednesdays that were wasted on less interesting lunches ! now that it ' s nice out , i will definitely have burger box on the brain . the menu isn ' t gigantic , but the food is clearly fresh and prepared with care . they actually listen to and execute your requested burger temperature ! the prices absolutely cannot be beat . N . N for a huge , real hamburger ? you can pay more than that at mcdonalds for a big mac . i love the offering of spicy cajun fries . they are quite addictive , but i still suggest sharing with a friend given the size of the order . burger box is a great addition to newark , and i ' m glad to see that others love it , too . now if only they could find some way to make those burger calories not count ! 
i took my sister to this restaurant for her birthday on a saturday night at N pm and was immediately seated at the bar . let me just say wow wow wow . i ' ve had some great sushi living in seattle , but this was one of the best i ' ve had . every morsel of sashimi sushi melted in our mouths . . . and i heard this echoed among some of the other patrons . my sister is a roll only type of person and when we found out this place didn " t have any ( dragon , spider , philly , rainbow rolls etc . ) she was a little bit disappointed , but by the end of the sushi and sashimi dinner , this restaurant converted a " california roll only " type into a sushi and sashimi fan . the staff were all japanese and extremely attentive , replacing dirty plates and pouring our beers at just the right time . we got hot towels in the beginning of the meal as well as the end . the decor was all bamboo wood interior . . . very minimalistic and elegant . the quality of the fish is really the star at this restaurant . besides the sushi , the best surpise of the night were the prices . . . . . i was expecting manhattan expensive sushi given it ' s location and was pleasantly suprised at how reasonable it was . i had the prix fixed sushi and sashima dinner ( N sashimi and N sushi N roll ) for N which came w soup or salad . she ordered about N-N different rolls and both had saporro ' s all for N . we both left full and throughly impressed at the quality and the service . definately a place to come again and again . 
what a gem ! ! ! as a transplant from nyc , i just figured i ' d never find another great restaurant like westville in manhattan in this area . this is better . we came in on labor day and they had a limited menu of holiday bbq items but we were not disappointed at all . i had the bbq tofu and it was a huge portion . i had to bring half of it home . N slabs of crispy on the edges and well sauced tofu served on N slices of white bread to soak up the sauce . the cole slaw was crunchy and vinegary which cut the sweetness of the bbq sauce and the pickles and little salad served atop the tofu really elevated this simple protein . i washed it down with a home made peach and raspberry unsweetened iced tea that was so refreshing on the N degree day . my husband had the baby back ribs and although he thought that N ribs was a small portion , he later amended his opinion . the ribs were huge and looked extremely tender . he left the table " omg " full . we also got the basket of corn bread madelines and mini biscuits which were a nice addition but we really didn ' t need it since we had the bread under our bbq . the waiter was extremely accommodating and answered all of our questions . he even threw a few extra biscuits in my to go container . i can not wait to go back to escape . i am so glad to have found this place on yelp . thank you yelp , and thank you escape ! 
love this place ! great decor , awesome staff , amazing food . . . big fan of the spicy basil noodles ! yum ! 
unreal lunch today ! i have to say this is the coolest place i have been to on the west side . unreal bowl of fries . go there highly recommended ! ! 
i wish i could give this review a N N N . this restaurant has amazing sushi , soup , salad , bubble teas , and all kinds of delicious japanese food . but on a saturday night , service takes about N minutes- N hour to get your food . but sometimes it ' s worth it and sometimes it ' s not . but i go here regularly , and i don ' t think that i have ever met someone mean who works their . the people who work there do tend to bring their kids in to watch t . v . in the back , but i think that makes it more of a family atmosphere . overall , i would give it N stars on yelp . 
hello , brunch . the food was good . the wait wasn ' t terrible in the least - the guy said N minutes and it was , indeed , about N minutes . i wish i could give this place N . N stars , actually , i think it deserves many points for food-goodness and the fact that they were playing mf doom , which always pairs well with brunch . the waitstaff was friendly and the service was fast . food i had the sage eggs on a roll thing . it was good . cheese was involved somehow . it was like someone very fancy spent a lot of time considering how to make the best " eggs on a roll " from a deli and then executed that concept with sage . good job ! i also had the hashbrowns , which the waitress said were " kind of like croquettes , " and they were . . . sort of delicately spicy . kind of mushier than i would have loved , but they were pretty damn good with maple syrup if you live like that . my man had the ricotta pancakes with fruit , he felt like it was a lot of pancake . they were light , which was exceptional news , because pancakes are hard to make beautifully , man . whining i have never sat on a less comfortable half-broken wooden beach chair . i felt like it was some kind of weird joke . ironic seating ! also , when it ' s N degrees , shut the fucking door , i don ' t care , it ' s cold and you ' re a dick -that ' s actually a complaint about the patrons because please stop wandering in on a gust of cold air and standing there slack-jawed while napkins blow off tables . when you are seated at the unfortunate table next to the coffee area , you will have butts right next to your face , and flying arms , and falling silverware and shit , and i am too old to be on alert for someone almost sitting in my eggs because she ' s not used to wearing massive palazzo pants while waiting for a table even though the very friendly waitstaff is asking people to wait outside to avoid stuff like sitting in eggs . we have such a wealth of decent food options all up in this piece that i don ' t need to sit in a silly torture chair with someone ' s ass in my face for good eggs because i could sit somewhere that isn ' t N degrees and i could have some decent eggs just fine . i like stumptown coffee with cute pictures in the froth as much as you do , pal , but i don ' t want an ass in my eggs and i don ' t want to have to duck because i ' m almost getting brained by people making coffee directly over my head . i ' d go back but not for brunchy butt eggs because i want to believe . also , mf doom . 
worst place ever . discrimination to chinese group . use " " chi-na " on the menu . that is a horrible discription . it ruins the " friendship " between china and japan . japan used this during wwii . it shows the " nazi " . the waitress only deliver the water and ask for the tip like a beggar . the food tastes just fine . finally parents felt unhappy about the experience . finally the charge is N . N . . based on the review and experience , we gave Nin total . very bad experience . save the Ncents for their bad service . 
we went to junior ' s on a chilly thursday evening . upon sitting we instantly settled on cheesecake and milkshakes . . . both came promptly and were de-li-cious ! if you want cheesecake . . . this is the place to go ! 
why oh why did i not discover this place when i lived in the neighborhood ? who would ' ve thought that there was something worthwhile in that horrible wasteland under the jmz . . this place looks like it ha been open for N years , but it turns out it ' s only been there for N years -- it was previously an office building . the designer deserves some sort of award for the decor - i wouldn ' t think you could fake " age " like that . ( think mcsorleys without the dust but done intentionally rather than by accident over the centuries ) great food , wine , and beer , too . 
it ' s really a shame , i was devil alley fan from the time it opened but the last couple visits there were a big disappointment . so i thought since smokin ' betty was the latest offering perhaps it would be better . my experience it was not . i was seated next to a big open window that was nice until the sirens going to jefferson started . i tried the wings with the dry rub , my server said it was pretty much the same as devil ' s alley . the wings were served at a tepid temperature . and the quality of the wings were not good . they were kind of rubbery and dry . they were not too fresh . the food runner was in drop and run mode . i had to ask for a set up which was not her fault . she did bring me back a complete set up which was more then my server did . i had the lamb burger which was good but nothing more . my server came to the table with check in before i was offered dessert . that ' s kind of rude . i felt rushed by that . the restrooms were a mess so at least i know one tradition fron devil ' s alley carried over . i won ' t be going back to either . 
so , i ' ve been to otto , really not impressed , but figure , let ' s give lupa a try . it has good reviews . to preface , the food here was fine . not great , certainly not spectacular , but not awful , just fine . perhaps though , i would have enjoyed it more had the manager on duty today not been so rude to our table . a woman in black came over to bring a fork to one of the guests in my lunch party and we were looking at the wine list . i asked the woman if she could please tell us about some of the wine choices and in the snottiest tone she replies " i don ' t know . i ' m not the som , i ' m the manager . " um , ok , i am sooooo sorry that i mistook you as someone having any knowledge about what ' s served in your restaurant ? why would the manager know that ? and ok , that ' s fine if she doesn ' t but there are about a dozen different nice ways she could have replied to my request if she didn ' t know the answer . also , a very good friend of mine has managed several high end restaurants through out the city and i have seen him at work and never in a million years would he condescend to a customer asking for a wine recommendation . N times out of N he would know what his restaurant was serving and if he didn ' t , he would happily find the answer . i ' m officially done with the batali properties . so just be warned people , don ' t get all gaga just because it ' s a batali . i think these places are given too much credit for the association with the name . 
pretty cool space . some really good spots . 
we seldom get a day off together without any obligations . . so we had yesterday off and decided to plan a date together . . oh , peaches you were soooooooo disappointing . we were seated right away and the hostess poured us some water , we waited a little while and our server came by to get us drinks . we ordered and were fine for a while just talking , until we realized it had been almost an hour and we hadn ' t even gotten our salad . when our server finally came back , she apologized and said our food would be right out . . around fifteen minutes later our food came , not our first course or any of the sides we ordered . . just two sad mistakes for entrees . oh my god it was bad . i see why we waited so long , they were busy overcooking our food . we ate about three bites each , asked for the check , waited another twenty minutes to pay and went somewhere else for food . . . don ' t waste your time here . . go somewhere else ! 
we where excited to try this new spot for our wedding aniversary . we arrived and where told there would be a N minute wait . this was not a problem , however we waitedvanotherbten to be approached by the bartender . one we received our drinks we waited and watched several other groups get seated that where there before us . still there was no problem , we watched as a table for N was cleared we believed this would be our table , since there was no one else waiting to be seated . at this point za couple walked in and began talking to the hostess and another staff member , another patron came out they apparently knew this couple . surprisingly they where . brought right over to the table that we thought was ours . not two minutes later the hostes walked over to explain that our table would be ready soon . i have never witnessed such poor professionalism in a resteraunt , when we confronted her she couldn ' t even deny what had happened . we got up and left . i will never return , it ' s a shame because i heard good things . 
this place was amazing . fantastic , knowledgable server , outstanding food and great ambiance . the hanger steak , ricotta cheese plate , cappellacci and escolar were all amazing ! ! the olive oil cake was the perfect most delicious finish . loved this place ! 
maharlika isn ' t just a restaurant , it ' s an experience . they don ' t market themselves as such , but they should . it ' s a very tiny space that you need a reservation at on weekends ( unless sit at the bar ) filled with a mix of older filipinos and swanky looking non-new yorkers ( former nyu students , i suspect ) . the menu is overwhelming for people who haven ' t had this kind of food before because the combinations and even some of the ingredients are completely foreign . we decided on a few things in order to explore the menu a little better and decided on their signature sisig ( everything from a pig that you normally wouldn ' t eat with chili , egg and onions served with garlic rice , N ) , pork belly with sauteed market greens ( N ) , eggplant ( N ) and the baby milkfish ( N ) . after we ordered , our server brought over a bunch of different sauces and explained what they should be eaten with and how we should use our utensils because they don ' t provide knives . all of the food was good , but my favorites were the pork belly and the garlic rice . the sisig was a little too tough for me and i thought the milkfish was pretty bland . the eggplant was interesting and as a side next time i ' d go with the market greens depending what they were . we also did dessert , the mango cheesecake and bourbon bread pudding ( N each ) . the bread pudding was good but the cheesecake was much better . i would love to come back here to try some more food but the most impressive part of the evening was the service . our server was excellent she was incredibly nice and provided useful suggestions without being intrusive . the only downside was that it ' s cash only , which is a little ridiculous considering the price of each dish . 
holy moly , amada is delicious . coming from chicago and la , my standards are extremely high for good food . i searched out a great spot for our weekend away in philly well in advance and made a reservation at amada after the amazing reviews . well yelpers , you did not disappoint ! must haves garrotxa garlic dulce de leche , piquillos rillenos ( and i don ' t even eat crab ) and the lechon flatbread . they also have a very cool bar that we hung out at while waiting for our table . they are great mixologists and make some delicious cocktails . our favorite , hands down , was broken hugs . go here , seriously . 
this is already a third time i ' m using your services , i ' m truly pleased with the accuracy and reliability you do your work . many thanks for your kind support and good luck with your business . 
terrible . gave our seat to four parties that came in after us . they added a third chair in the corner next to a drafty window to a table for two . talked back without apologizing for incorrect orders . didn ' t tell us about a menu change until it was past time to order . food was definitely frozen first . 
good vegan food ok for kosher big portions great taste
the ramen here is not good . noodles were whatever , broth insipid , the egg tasteless . only good part of the bowl i had today was the pork . it ' s unbelievable that it ' s so favorably reviewed . only in new york . everything else about the place is great . 
good pizza with a real neighborhood feel . old school brookyn all the way , love their squares and hope this place never goes away . an institution ! 
the food fantastic . best mussels i ' ve had in brooklyn , everything came out pretty quick , and tasted amazing . the drinks cocktail , yay , get the old fashioned . the service even more fantastic . there was a wait , but the host ( danny ) was so lovely . he kept checking on us to let us know how far along we were , asked us to wait a little longer so he could sit us inside b c he felt the rain was coming ( it did ) . when it ' s nice out , the garden is great . throughout the meal made sure we were satisfied and oh boy were we . especially in williamsburg , where most of the time the servers act too cool for school and aren ' t the most pleasant of people ( i ' ve waited tables , but can i get a smile ? ) . . anyway , we ' ll surely be back . over and over again . truly fantastic in every aspect . 
i have to give it N stars , but there are some caveats . it ' s N stars because the outdoor beer garden is a great way to hang out , period . amazing more people haven ' t thought of this . ( steven starr clearly deserves his successes ! ) that said , it is fairly pricey the food options are limited . but it ' s a lot of fun . and some of the german menu items ( schnitzel anyone ? ) are a nice change of pace . 
best brunch place in park slope- ) coming back real soon ! 
terrible service . i got the sense that they couldn ' t be bothered . it took a long time for anything to come out , then we were given the wrong food , then N starter came out and had to wait N minutes for the other . they tried to give me a completely different entree to what i had ordered because , by there own admission they put in the wrong order . no apology , and it will be a bit longer . no there attitude was just ' here eat this ' . they made a substitution in my partners dish without even telling him , much less asking whether this was ok . they never checked in with us , never brought a desert menu , and i had to walk into the waiters pantry area to get someone to take my payment . could not have been worse . 
a total favorite ! i love the duck meatloaf , i love the warm lamb salad , i love the strangers i find myself chatting with at the bar when i take myself on a solo date there . i ' m giving this N s because you owe it to yourself to enjoy more than one course , though you will be really full ! 
biked here on the first really hot spring day in N and was slightly disappointed with the service , but still had generally tasty food . my roommate and i came after we randomly tried los caballitos in south philly ( dos segundos ' sister restaurant ) and had a great dining experience there . we expected dos segundos to be better due to the higher yelp ratings , but our personal experience didn ' t reflect that . it took a long time for anyone to come over and acknowledge us after we had already been seated by a waiter , and when the chips arrived , they were oddly stale . still , love that green salsa and would probably have an iv of that hooked up to me if i could . they also did not refill our chips , and we had to ask for more ( at los caballitos our waiter brought us new ones without us saying anything ) . the rest of the food itself was pretty good . my roommate ordered a bean fried plantains torta ( N ) and was very pleased at its size ( huge-- good leftovers ) . i ordered the shrimp ceviche ( N ) , which is always a smaller serving , but still filled me up ( thanks to the ongoing chips and salsa as well ) and tasty , except that it was a bit overwhelmed with too many red onions . i got a mojito ( N ) that was perfect for the super hot day and for dining outside . my overall experience was positive , and it was great for a hot day , but the docked stars are due to the lesser service we received and the stale chips . my roomie also pointed out that they charge extra for things that usually come standard on mexican food ( salsa , cheese , sour cream ) . i would still try it again since it ' s much closer to me than los caballitos and the food is still generally very good . the music they have playing is also usually good and i like their atmosphere . 
best pizza in philly that i have had so far ! ! ! ! i would not reccomend their boneless buffalo wings . . . . they are big thick chunks of chicken ! otherwise , their stromboli rolls and pizza are the best ! 
i rarely get around to writing reviews due to my own forgetfulness , but had to make extra effort to express my opinion of this place . we ordered the brussels , shrimp bun and miso soup with pork . all i can really say is that the richness of flavor blew my mind . never had anything like it . absolutely delicious and will make you seriously consider ordering seconds . whether you ' re into this genre of food or not , you owe it to yourself to check this place out . the space itself was intimate , friendly and attentive staff . we were seated right away and were in and out in about N min . this was lunchtime on a monday . 
came here w my boyfriend last weekend , the atmosphere was great so was the service . i ordered the " pig mac " he ordered chicken waffles . the food was ok not great the main thing i had a problem with was the seat were soooo close together being that my boyfriend is N ' N he looked really uncomfortable . . experience was ok but don ' t think i will be back going again
i saw emma stone at cookshop this afternoon for brunch . her hair was blonde ( for the new spiderman movie ) and she was gorgeous . whoo ! now that i ' ve gotten that exciting announcement out of the way . . . the place was pretty crowded because it ' s a popular spot and the tables were a bit close together . the layout didn ' t detract from the quality of their food or service though . - beignets N crispy fried balls of fluffy , eggy dough . delicious with the orange marmalade they sat atop - carolina white shrimp salad this was just good , not great . it had a lot of interesting ingredients and sounded very promising ( blood orange , fennel , radish , etc ) but i found the actual salad to be a bit dull . the shrimp would have benefitted from some grilling or crispening up . - huevos rancheros i only got a taste of this dish but from what i tried , it was delicious . i love black beans and eggs with tomato-salsa type sauces . yum bright brunch spot with solid food . i ' ll definitely be back ! 
this is a wonderful little spot tucked away from center city . in our neck of the woods , decent places to eat are few and far between ( not counting you memphis tap ) . ever since we moved into our house a few years ago this place was on my radar to try . i am totally not sure why it took us a while to get our bumms here but i am glad we did . we first did a family brunch ( maybe for mom ' s birthday ? ) . the brunch menu has something for everyone and we all love our meal . we started with a breakfast bruchetta to all share , which was plenty for the N of us . on the menu there were plenty of creative and plenty of " safe " offerings - both sweet and savory choices . but the menu was not overwhelming . the coffee was excellent and since we byo ' d it ( champagne ) they brought out a carafe of oj for us - maybe two ( hey , we like to drink ) the hubby and i returned a while later for dinner , which was also very enjoyable . and we have been back a few times since and have yet to be disappointed ! a few tips breakfast is available for takeout too . can we say fireplace ( working ! ) nice staff . cozy , warm atmosphere . parking can be tricky , but its not too bad . local art is displayed proudly . i found the portions to be huge . 
N . N stars samba offers very enjoyable food but falls short of an exceptional overall experience . the small , cozy eatery is ill-equipped to handle groups . our party of five was initially refused seating when the restaurant was half empty , a head-scratcher if there ever was one . pushing two tables together solved this problem though it made for somewhat snug accommodations . following that misstep , servers proved to be polite and knowledgeable . food arrived from the kitchen relatively promptly , a relief given our appetites . our group had a chance to try everything from steak to seafood to chicken , and nary a dish struck out . a garlic shrimp appetizer was bursting with flavor and an order of mussels came liberally bathed in tasty tomato . my entr e of choice included a steak topped with a fried egg paired with collards and a fried banana . the steak was cooked well , the collards thankfully lacked bitterness , and the banana provided a sweet , crunchy bite . portions were quite generous and were made larger by rice and beans for the table , which , admittedly , could have used more flavor . given both the quality and the quantity of the food , samba ' s prices are not altogether unreasonable . but with entrees starting in the high teens , be prepared to spend . with handsome dark wood that recalls an old tavern , samba offers an inviting ambiance for couples seeking a special meal . for larger groups , however , the limited space seriously undermines the appeal . the food is satisfying in either scenario , but the tradeoff inherent in the latter keeps this from being an automatic " sim ! " 
love the mushroom tacos , with mass fries on the side . 
stay away . paid N for two entrees that took forever , and when they arrived they were cold . try ponte romano instead . 
so i decided to seek yelp ' s opinion on the best burger in the east village and this place was ranked highest . i went on a thursday evening around N . there were a few people there but it wasn ' t crowded . i went up to the bar to place my order N regular and N bacon slider with a bowl of fries . after about N minutes i approached the bar to get an estimate on the time as it was taking a little while . then i was told that i actually had a server who would bring the order to me . hmmm . how is it that i hadn ' t seen a server in N min . the food was ok but i wouldn ' t go out of my way to return . the burgers were , in fact , dripping with grease and tasted so-so . the taste came from the onions and cheese - less so the beef . the sauces were ok at best . the fries were served hot and seasoned well . glad i tried it but as there are so many spots around that serves burgers , i ' ll shop around more before returning . 
my opinion- i believe the staff is prejudice ! my child tried to purchase food here and he was treated as if he was beneath and turned away . some adults should show more respect to children and set a far better example regardless of the situation- especially when running an establishment . i was at the hair salon down the street and i was unable to go with him to purchase his food therefore i gave him my debit card and he was turned away . ( second attempt ) i sent a note including my signature stating that he had my permission to purchase the food via my debit card . ( third attempt ) one of the workers at the salon offered to go as evidence that i was a current customer of their establishment and i could not walk down to pick up the food . ( fourth and final attempt ) i then placed the order over the phone and advised the cashier of the situation and that he will be picking up the food and i even suggested paying over the phone and she advised me that it was not a problem for him to use my card since i was placing the order . when my son arrived and the owner noticed him leaving with his order , the owner came around the counter and began banging on the counter and told my son to put the food down and felt the need to yell at him . my son is a very intelligent kid and he was extremely bothered by the way this adult handled the situation over a N . N meal . my son was simply doing what his mother advised him to do and it was shown that he was indeed the bigger person in the situation . i am proud that he handled it very well and i will continue to teach my children the right and wrong way to act in this society regardless of others shortcomings and ill mannered ways . knowledge will forever govern ignorance and people who mean to be their own governors , must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives ! 
i made a reservation for N N and was running late and they were totally okay with moving the reservation and holding my table on a busy wednesday night . we ordered the cazuela marinara , the salmon , maduros , and a pitcher of sangria . the food was in very small portions which i did not expect , and the flavors weren ' t anything outstanding . the restaurant was extremely loud , even though there was not a live band at this point . i had to get used to shouting across the table , and chuckling every time i overheard the table next to me ' s conversation . ( older man name dropped N cities he had been to in europe to his date as she swooned , hilarious ) . the restaurant had a homey feel , and the waiters were pleasant however the service was a little slow . if you are looking for a night out and you arent trying to get to know the person across the table , this is a nice destination . 
wow , i really enjoyed the ramen here . the pork gyoza was very fresh but burned . i ordered the basic with thick noodle and it was very good . however , my friends ordered the minca sio with thin noodle and oh . mi . goodness . the broths are thick and delicious , the sio with a more garlic flavor . i want to go back . right now . i don ' t know much about ramen or other places like ipuddo but i know my mouth enjoyed the food here . the place is small but a fun experience and we waited maybe N minutes at Npm on a monday . 
just randomly yelped a breakfast place as soon as we got to ny . found this cute little quaint restaurant . place was filled even on a lazy thursday morning . had their abuelos egg sandwich . never had a egg sandwich like this . everything was cooked perfectly and complimented each other from the cheese , to the ham , to the egg to the bread . saw their lunch menu and wanted to stay but so full afterwards . sounded like super comfort food . just what you need a cold day right ? def want to come back again ! 
sat upstairs at the rooftop bar to enjoy brunch with some friends . such good food , the banana foster waffles were delicious . the bartender anna was such a sweetheart and made some fantastic drinks . i would recommend the " london iced tea " , so refreshing ! overall a fantastic experience and i will definitely be back ! 
recently sat on the patio on a beautiful afternoon for a late lunch . unfortunately , the service was poor . we ordered our lunches and waited patiently with no water for N minutes . a manager came over and asked how everything was . really ? we are sitting at an empty table with empty water glasses . he brought out water and our waitress who asked if wanted bread . N minutes later she came out with our order but no bread . she seemed surprised when we asked for that again . the chicken and brie panini i ordered had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp - it was dry and crumbly . not very much chicken and no pizzazz . the waitress never came over to check on us , or to refill our water . we just sat there with a table full of dirty dishes . finally , after waiting for quite some time , we had to ask the hostess for our check . a busboy brought us the check and the waitress came back for payment . interestingly , there was a manager on the patio most of the time but he didn ' t seem to be interested in attending to his guests . there are so many great places on palmer square , don ' t pick this one . 
the sicilian slice at l b is ridiculously good . the traditional pie is mediocre . definitely worth a trip to experience the ultimate sicilian slice . 
i can ' t tell you how many times we ' ve been here . why ? because we go that frequently . because the food is always consistently good as is the service . and we have to drive to get there each time ! we love you henri . 
came here with a group of N . service was great and very responsive . food was good and waiters were willing to make modifications to what was on the menu . not overly pushy which i like and is hard to find in little italy . we were all happy and stuffed by the time that we left . would definitely come back if i were in the area . 
what ' s up with all my pizza reviews on yelp ? they seemed to have all disappear . damn . . . must ' ve been too . . . cheesy ? ha ! anyway - this is the top pizza place i ' ve been to in nyc . take the subway to brooklyn . . . grab some pizza here . . . and walk back to manhattan across the bridge . overall - pizza is delicious , fresh cheese , light thin crust , and awesome meat ! highly recommended . . . 
amazing food ! tasty and real , i love it ! 
after trying out ippudo west ' s grand opening just the day before , i wanted to compare the two after reading so many great reviews for zutto . after having dinner at zutto , the two cannot even compare . i much prefer the ramen at zutto as it isn ' t as salty . i love the chill , laid back atmosphere and the wooden tables . where else can you find a pub that serves comforting japanese american food . they have a good selection of steamed buns . i tried their portabella and short rib buns which were great . who knew that parmesan went well in a steamed bun . as for their ramen , i had to try their one of a kind parma-karma ramen ( what a name ! ) . the hint of parmesan was subtle yet it worked well with the ramen . also , the staff was extremely kind . 
came here again tonight to celebrate a friend ' s b-day . i had to up this to N stars . last time i went there were more of us and a little bit crazy busy . going after work on a wkday is perfect . everything was so good ! papaya salad - so fresh , spicy spicy ginger mussels appetizer - flavorful and meaty prah-hok kahteeh - caramelized pork perfect with the fresh veggies sah-law kah-rhee mohn - curry chicken was delicious ! my only regret is that we couldn ' t try more of the dishes
this place has ruined cheesecake for me forever ! they use a thin angel cake crust instead of graham cracker so the crust doesn ' t take away from the cheesecake . it was so creamy ! ! ! ! and with just enough crust to make a texture difference . oh yeah , and there ' s the food . . . . . i had the fish chips . the fish was so fresh it melted in my mouth . my husband had the N oz . steak burger and it was sooooooo good ! a must stop if you ' re in times square . 
we ' ve lived in woodbridge for N years and this is the best place we ' ve found for pizza . the regular and the sicilian are both terrific . i think the secret is in the sauce . it took awhile but i finally figured out the non-traditional herb they use simmering it . i immediately adapted my own home recipe to include it . the pie crust is nice and crispy , which is the way we love it
my family has been holding events here since i was kid . i attended my cousin ' s wedding reception here last night and remembered to write a review . the manor screams classiness . it ' s an upscale venue where you should dress your best . the gardens are well kept and the halls are tastefully furnished great for photos . the night began with cocktail hour on the patio . two open bars along with a selection of appetizers chosen by the hosts . calamari , seafood salad , oysters , shrimp cocktail , roast duck , roast pig , broiled lamb , and other not animal related items were featured . they were good , but nothing really " wowed " me . the bartenders were decently skilled . i didn ' t need to tell them how to make a long island ( i ' ve had to do that before ) . not sure what it was but i simply could not get drunk that night . liquor wasn ' t watered down either since i picked up a few trays of shots . moving on to dinner , we were seated in the main area as servers took our dinner entree orders . first course was lobster bisque . it wasn ' t bad but found it lackluster . comparable to the lobster bisque i had a wawa the day before . next was salad . salad is salad . ordered prime rib as my entree . came with string beans and carrots and what looked like a block of mashed potatoes . the browning on top makes me believe the mashed potatoes were baked in some sort of dish and cut into pieces . beans and carrots were slightly undercooked . prime rib was bland . overall , the manor is a very nice venue with good service . but the food is , for the most part , average . N . N overall . 
overpriced . food was not good . owner was arrogant and rude . felt bad for the staff . 
it is ok . used to take the nieces there and get a salad , most of which are quite good , and a burger . good place to go with kids both for the menu and the staff both of which are kid friendly . now that they ' ve grown don ' t go there very often . 
i just got into sushi , so i am trying a bunch of different places . by far , this one was great ! great service and food and not bad on the price at all ! 
great brunch place with reasonable prices . definitely try eggs norwegian - brunch special that comes with two beverages . 
beware ! my wife and i recently went to the amish market in princeton . we loved the people who worked there and the quality of food was excellent . we went to the fresh vegetables and bought N lbs of red potatoes , N lbs of carrots and N pound of fresh strings bean which came to over N . my wife questioned the price and the cute little amish girl smiled and repeated the price . we were rushed out by an impatient woman behind us who apparently had to have N tomatoes as soon as possible and felt the need to reach over my wife ' s shoulder while she questioned the price . they apparently don ' t like to give receipts to customers unless they ask . why ? i recommend buying products that are exclusively theirs and passing on the products which can be bought anywhere else . beware ! 
the spicy bowl and soup dumplings were amazing ! ! i have never had anything like it before . it is a must try if you are visiting . 
update went back twice and i ' ve since got the pulled pork sandwich and the ribs and damn ! ! seriously some of the best bbq i ' ve ever had . soooooo gooooood . . . . 
if i could give this place less than one star , i would . i created a yelp account for the sole purpose of telling you all how awful my experience was at founding fathers . four of us hoped to dine here on new year ' s day , late afternoon . the service was nothing less than atrocious . this was not the fault of our server , a friendly woman who did her best to help us . the source of the problem came from the " manager " on duty , who was awful for the job . to start , there was not a hostess in site . we sat ourselves after a N-N minute period . the staff consisted of the " manager , " two waitresses , and a single bartender . given that this is a busy day for late lunches and drinks , they were severely understaffed . everyone else who entered did the same thing , leaving the two waitresses with a packed house to serve . the so-called manager was doing very little to help , and should have been telling people that there would be a wait , rather than letting everyone enter and sit . it took about N minutes to get water and menus , and another N before we got sodas and ordered food . it was an hour wait before we got our food , and the appetizer we ordered came out last . however , in that time , a group of N who knew the manager personally was seated , received N rounds of drinks , multiple apps , and their meals . it was disgusting to see him play favorites . meanwhile , every other table that had arrived prior to them was waiting on food . one table cheered aloud when they got their drinks after a half hour wait . while waiting for our food , we asked if we could have something comped , given the awful service . we almost left before the food arrived , but stayed when we saw the waitress bringing it out . as she got us to-go boxes , she said she would ask the manager about having a pizza taken off of the bill . in addition to not helping her and the other waitress with the abundance of customers , he offered no compensation . needless to say , i will never be going back here . i will also be telling everyone i know not to attend this place . i ' m just glad that i got to deter some people from eating there , as we were sitting right by the entrance , and told them they ' d have better luck elsewhere . 
i wanted to like this place ! ( but the staff is so rude ( i had been warned about this and should have listened ! ) . my husband and i came here before the theater and we asked very politely if they could check our food , since we had a show to catch ( after waiting for our food for over N minutes , so i think it was a reasonable question at that point ) . the waitress and even the ( manger ? hostess ? the woman with dark hair ) both of them became defensive . ugh . . . we just wanted to leave so we skipped dessert and just asked for the check . bummer . hatrford needs a good wine bar . 
this place used to be good . now , expect to wait around for a good N minutes before a server can even take your drink order . its a great atmosphere , especially when they open the outdoor patio . but the service just got horrendousfood was delicious , now its mediocre . no one wants to wait around for an hour to eat a burger , and that is exactly what your going to get at opcao . 
definitely not impressed with this place . i heard a lot of good things online , and my husband and i are both gluten free and i saw there were great gluten free options , but we were disappointed . after viewing the gluten free menu ( maybe N app options , N salad options , and N-N main course options ) we ordered lobster fried rice - which was super dry , barely any lobster , and overwhelming saffron taste , and cashew chicken - which was pretty good , mainly because it was drenched in sauce . my husband ordered a drink from the bar that was highly overpriced for what it ended up being . would not go back . points for ambiance decor though . 
the best pizza and hotdogs around ! i ' ve been coming here since i was a kid . the pizza its great ! nicely cooked well done crust . it delicious . the single dogs double dogs are superb ! they cook it right there in front of you ( if the line isn ' t to long , if not you have to sit and wait ) they load ' em with whatever you like , onions , peppers , the works ! but the potato ' s are the best . the hot dog is topped of with the yummy potato ' s . i sometimes order a potato plate on the side ) 
loved it ! ! such a great variety of food and beer . it ' s worth going back just for the parmesan truffle fries ! 
great food , friendly service . love this place ! have had several meals there and always try something different . the staff is great with suggestions and explaining what things are if i ' m i sure . 
nice place for drinks . cool and relaxed atmosphere . the area by the bar is crowded , but there ' s another room with table seating . i tried their beer ( which came in a cool jar ) and it was good . they had a nice variety of drinks . only thing we ate here was their fries and they were pretty awesome . 
when i came to balthazar for a late dinner with friends , i wasn ' t even really hungry . two and a half hours , three courses , and two bottles of wine later . . . i didn ' t want to stop eating . we started with , of course , fries and mayo . delicious . seriously , i dream about these fries . i ordered the seared organic salmon for my main dish and it was absolutely fantastic . . . finished the entire thing . we ended with creme brulee , which didn ' t disappoint . the service and the atmosphere were top-notch . it ' s unpretentious , yet upscale . . . . and totally the type of place you can go to really relax and enjoy yourself with great friends . can ' t wait to go back . 
i am soooo happy this spot opened up ! ! ! ! an authentic japanese ramen house that is close to home and reasonably priced ? ! ? love it ! for apps i ' ve had the gyoza , edamame , chicken wings , and pork buns . each dish has its unique flare to it and tastes so good ! i had the ani ramen and spicy miso ramen dishes and they were absolutely delish ! don ' t forget to get the flavored oils and add extras ( soft boiled egg , mushrooms , etc ) to customize ur bowl of ramen ! the staff are all very friendly even in a packed setting ( i have yet to see this place in " slow " mode ) . i love the smart marketing and simple menu , the decor , and the little black book they give u with the check so u can write your thank u ' s and any other silly notes u wanna leave ! the best thing to do if ur waiting for a table is the read the instructions about eating ramen on the wall when u first walk in ! slurp . sip . repeat ! ! ! ! 
wow , wow , wow ! i had gone to hawthornes to pick up a six pack of efes , which i hadn ' t had since i was in turkey last october . imagine my suprise when i found an incredible , small , almost gourmet restaurant right smack dab in the middle of this beer heaven . i hung out for an hour until the kitchen opened for dinner service and it was well worth the wait . while waiting i sat by the fireplace and savored to glasses of over ale by the half acre beer company . the beer had a russet red brown color to it , with medium bodied fullness and held a good head . once the kitchen opened , i ordered a mediterranean plate which was well prepared and fresh brought back memories of my visit to turkey . next up was braised short ribs over a potato pancake with asparagus . the short ribs were fork tender , juicy and full of flavor . the potato pancake was crispy on the outside and soft full of flavor on the inside . just as it should have been . finally , the asparagus was mouth watering ! roasted in a simple garlic salt olive oil combo it was cooked perfectly and full of flavor . the service was excellent and very accommodating without being overbearing . the price more than reasonable . i will definitely be back . hawthorne ' s you have found a new customer ! 
been here N times and the food never disappoints ! the burger is to die for . so perfect ! and the beer selection is absolutely incredible ! last night had the reuben rolls for the first time and they were great too . big improvement from it ' s predecessor pbr ( food wise anyway ) . so glad this spot stayed open and got Nx better . definitely recommended ! 
went for a sunday dinner here . overall , good service but echo some prior comments that it ' s underwhelming . tried my friends ribs , they were phenomenal . small though for an entreee . . . N for a N ribs ? ambiance was cozy totally east village nyc foodie spot good craft beer selection pig ear appetizer was unique ( small tho ) and yummy - ' rice n beans ' dish truly rice beans plus a few pieces of lamb . seriously for a place which has such good meat , they really skimp on the good stuff . . . -space is very tight . not a large group spot at all . for example , my jacket kept getting knocked down off my chair in sum a place i ' d take one or two foodie friends to try something new , but definitely not a place for regulars . . . 
the penne vodka could be better than some italian restaurants . . . . they know what they are doing here . the family that owns this place also owns brookside diner ( which is also outstanding ) . i would give this place your business before going anywhere else . seriously never had better tasting food and service . . . like . . . at any diner . and this place is cleaner than any diner i ' ve ever seen . just phenomenal . flat out phenomenal . if i could give more than N stars i would
best restaurant ever . loved the service had a great night . i come very often . the owner is even a great entertainer . 
yay ! ! ! they serve veggie hot dogs now - tried the seattle dog and it was delicious ! ! ! great beer , awesome backyard , friendly staff patrons . . . . and now vegetarian friendly food ! ! ! i couldn ' t be happier . 
great mexican cuisine
good time , good food and a good selection of beers , wait staff very friendly , we had very good time last friday , the croquettes were delicious , the falafel burger a whole new experience , train wreck fries a must , and the ambiance was great . 
lets start with the good well let me start off by saying the place looks very nice the atmosphere is great i love the look . it is also is a good thing because it is open Nhrs so no matter what time you can get service , unfortunetlly its not great service at all if you come with a group of more than N , they will deny you entry , even if its two groups one of N and another of N they willnot accept you . we asked to speak to a manger because we had a group of N and came in seperate cars and the first group of N entered first and we were denied a table even if the rest of the party werent present , . we told the so called security or wanna be bouncer that we would have seperate tables and he said no i am not gonna seat you guys . no i feel he was profiling us not saying racially but it may be from something else why he did that his name was bert by the way tall fat bald guy . we then asked to speak to the manager and was told no we asked why and he said as long as you guys are in here i will not get the manager , we decided as young women that we came very respectable to this place and should not be treated in this way and told bert we will not move until he gets the manager which he didnt and said it not about racial profilling or about black and white but this is our policy we just have the right to deny anyone we feel like and also allowed to kick you out if we choose . we went and got the manager ourselves and was even more surprised at what the manager told us after he seat only N of us and said the others cannot be seated , he said that bert and there staff is trained to act in that manner to guest that are like that . very shocked at the treatment and felt that i should share this with everyone . restaurantso was outside at time when we decided not for just N people out of N to eat there and bert was smoking and decided to blow the smoke in one of our faces as we were leaving the resturant , which was totally disrespectful and rude eat here only if you can be profiled and judge without a problem and be disrespected by so called security and manager then this is the best place for you enjoy
they are good , but i had better . a little pricy and overrated . 
this was my first visit to the restaurant and i can ' t wait to visit again . the hospitality made me feel like i was in taverna in greece . the staff were friendly , professional and down to earth . the atmosphere is warm and inviting . great for hanging out with friends and it also has a romantic side so you can come on a date . everything i ate tasted fresh and amazing . the complimentary dips were fresh , homemade and fantastic . the lemon potatoes and grilled octopus with bacon were to die for . i also really appreciated the extensive greek wine list . two of my favorites were on the list . and lastly i loved the greek spin on the halva . it was served to perfection with the greek coffee . 
go get a bronte sandwich ! go get a bluey sandwich ! heck . . go get any of the damn sandwiches that come with an inclusive side salad dressed with one of the best salad dressings i ' ve ever tasted ! run . . don ' t walk ! their sandwiches are fantastic . juicy , flavorful served on crusty moist toasted ciabatta bread ! this place is as small as a large closet but soooo worth it . i crave this place ! 
came here for takeout because i didn ' t feel like cooking . i ' ve eaten in before , but this time i ordered online , which i ' m usually all about because you can double check what you ' re ordering without going " huh ? " N times over the phone . i ordered a bacon burger and paid extra for cheddar cheese instead of american because american cheese is freaking gross . a few minutes later , i picked up my order , brought it home , and was seriously disappointed to find basically liquid american cheese on it . not to mention that the burger was flopped together and overcooked . fortunately , the fries were delicious . 
i ' m giving this location four stars because it is simply among the very best at what they serve and that is falafel . incredible falafel at that . you walk in and tell them what you want , what kind of topping , and within a minute or so they would make a fresh one made to your order . the falafel balls are fried till it ' s nicely crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside . the bread that they use is off the shelf not home made , but you could taste the freshness of the chickpeas , lettuce , and the sauce . for those of you that loves spicy stuff , they have a spicy sauce in a squeeze bottle either by the counter or tables . it ' s truly spicy though so for those that can ' t take the heat , avoid . at a price of N . N each there is almost no better bargain for this quality in the rest of manhattan . the one at st . marks also makes their own drinks . i highly recommend the tamarind drink or better yet , the freshly made mango juice . can ' t go wrong for a dollar for a small cup and they are simply delicious . sadly , the mamoun ' s at greenwich village don ' t carry the drinks . the guy behind the counter told me there was simply no space for it in the greenwich location since it ' s smaller . because the one at st . marks carry the mango juice which i simply can ' t get enough of , i give that one one more star then the one at greenwich village . 
this place is starting to grow on me . came here a second time and the service was just as good if not slightly better . food was presented well as usually but i what i did notice is that this place does more filling than rice in their sushi , so you know they ' re definitely not trying to cheat you out of your money . and any place that wants play westlife on repeat is thumbs up to me ! 
i brought my brother here when he was visiting new york . he was skeptical that the pizza here could really be better than your typical ny-slice . but now he ' s a convert ! the dough is perfect , and the cheese just melts right off . the touristy vibe is a bit too much if you live here , but it ' s worth it for the awesome pizza . 
went for lunch . very small quick place . . . lobster roll is delicious but should come with more lobster in it for N . . fish and chips-- fish was fresh but batter had no flavor and would come off the fish . fries weren ' t all that . . . . i need go back to really get a better experience . i just know it was way too expensive for the lobster roll with not enough lobster in it . 
nice ramen but such an annoying scene to have to wait for N hours to eat casual food . . 
i was looking forward to dinner here as i ' d heard good things , but it was sort of all over the map . the spanish octopus was pretty tasty , and the cilantro jalape o sauce was really good , but it was this one piece of a tentacle for fifteen bucks . broccoli cauliflower was roasted and good , but nothing really special . nice to have on a cold day . i was really excited for the bone marrow tacos , but they just didn ' t work . which sucks because i love bone marrow and i love tacos . made me sad . the fries were fine , but nothing special . hands down , the best thing on the menu was the chicken liver pancetta p t . rich , creamy , smooth , awesome . i wish everything were this good . my large plate was the pork chop . it was good , if a bit over cooked . plenty of juice , but a lot of the flavor came from the chutney . to drink , i had an old fashioned , which was a little too syrup-ey for my taste . not my favorite . the beer menu was also disappointingly small . service was also spotty . it started out really well , but slowed as the evening progressed . a bit pricey for what it is too . i ' d come back on occasion if it were in my hood , but probably not go out of my way for it . 
great little place we stumbled upon by accident on a saturday night . i had the grilled chicken sandwich , which was amazing - i substituted aged provolone for the goat cheese and i loved it . the fries were awesome , piping hot and seasoned well - not a single one went uneaten . i had the chardonnay , which was a healthy pour in a large glass . my date had the hangar steak with roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts and said it was delicious . he started out with the manhattan clam chowder , which was full of shrimp and had whole clams on the side . the atmosphere was very cozy - i could actually talk to my date without screaming over obnoxious bar music . we ' ll be back . 
the redhead is great-- my friend and i ended up there after a brunch and had some great drinks . fun and super nice bartenders . really neighborhood-ish , we talked with the other people at the bar all afternoon and had a great time . we didn ' t eat but i hear the food is really good . 
good turkey burger ( with actual real cheddar on it ) , but sadly you have to buy fries separately . ice cream is pretty standard but a bit pricey . what really makes it here is the view of the lake . absolutely gorgeous . 
one of my favourite chinese restaurants in new york chinatown , whether for a full meal or just a snack . had dined here several times and enjoyed the roasted duck and pork , lobster fried noddles and a variety of congees . they are about as close to what you can find as in asia though not as refined . 
if you want a philly cheesesteak come to this place ! this is usually where i eat when i go to philadelphia because their cheesesteaks are so delicious . the people making the food don ' t exactly have smiling faces , but god it ' s so worth it to eat here . 
the original on carmine st has closed , but the branches on university place and west Nth are like familiar club houses . the food is a sort of woody alan essence of holistic organic with everything . i had a turkey burger with spinach salad the last time i was there , service is unhurried even on a saturday afternoon or sunday morning , coffee is excellent . atmosphere is abundant . 
i got a cheese omelet with bacon and homefries . the eggs were not scrambled well at all and the cheese was not melted in the omelet . the homefries tasted like grease . it was terrible , but the waitress was nice . 
quality cheap restaurant . 
your mama can ' t make fried chicken like this . your mama can ' t make donuts like these - unless she works here
drinks were awesome , loved the fresh ingredients in my mojito . interesting selection of tacos , but was dissapointed as the fillings were only luke-warm on arrival to our table and the totillas were cold and doughy . our sides ( coleslaw , spicy cucumber salad , and corn on the cob ) were absolutely amazing . arestaurant was clean and decor was nice . it was very busy at N for dinner , walked by a few days later on the weekend and there was huge crowd there later ( around N or N ) with a dj . will definately return- hope that once thigns are up and running food will be a bit better . 
this is not authentic indian food . i have been to just about all of the indian restaurants in the area and the food at krishna does not even compare . i somewhat enjoyed the samosa appetizer , but the naan was doughy and undercooked and my chicken tikka masala tasted like it was bathed in chili sauce . the food is completely lacking traditional indian spices , especially curry . when we spoke to the waiter and politely told him the food was bland , he admitted that this is " indian for americas " with very little spice . i will not return . 
we went out of our way to come here , it was a weekday and a beautiful , warm october day , N minute wait at most . once we got seated , we scanned the menu and were excited to order and finally try this place out . since my two friends and i were all ordering the same ramen , with one variation- one bowl without pork belly , it would be easier to just have one person order , simple enough right ? wrong . as i was ordering , in the middle of my sentence , the server cut me off , held her hand up at me , looked at my friends and said- " wait , let me ask them what they want . " whoa . speechless . not sure how to react to that one except it killed my entire once-excited-feeling . she gets the title for being the rudest person to ever take my order . she made me feel extremely incompetent . i was speaking in plain english , lady , not sure what her problem was . i couldn ' t help but think- did i stutter , was i talking too slow , too fast ? in tongue ? she rarely came to our table to check up on us . and in our small interactions with her , like - ' hi , can we please have some more water ? ' she didn ' t say a word , just really cold . really bizarre . we observed her at other tables , she was smiling and jolly with the other male patrons , even kneeled down to explain the menu offerings . the ramen came and it was unmemorable , in all honesty , i ' ve had better . sure the bowls are big but it doesn ' t mean the raman was filled to the brim , the taste wasn ' t there and its really too expensive for such a mediocre meal . so the experience was terrible and off putting . i decided not to tip on my share . . . there ' s a first for everything . my friends were free to do what they wished since the rudeness wasn ' t directed toward them . we head down to use the bathroom before heading out . as i was using the lady ' s room , i hear the server interrogate my friends outside the door , saying its customary to tip N in nyc . my gfs explained the situation and how she was being rude . i come out , asked if there is a problem but she just walked away . N - i understand how tipping works . N - i understand what customary means . N customary is not mandatory . trust me lady , i worked in a japanese restaurant in college , when someone doesn ' t tip N , heck i ' ve had people tip my colleagues N , you just move on . get over it . people have reasons for tipping , its a personal preference . to chase people down and question why we didn ' t tip N , on top of the ridiculously poor service , is really something else . we spoke with the manager and he said he ' ll have a meeting with her . i wish i knew her name , it was a japanese name . the hype was overrated . to say she was unprofessional is an understatement . never coming back . try totto ramen instead , they are Nx better on every level imaginable . and that ' s all i have to say about that -forest gump . 
best mexican on the east coast
this is a new restaurant in newark international airport gate c N . it has ipads to order from which is nice but when you order you must pay with a credit card and include tip . now wait for the surprise . . . . the food is inedible ! they do fine with bringing you a bottle of beer or a glass of wine but don ' t get the food ! run fast as you can ! the pictures on the ipad make it look like it ' s great what you get is disgusting . good luck . 
the food was so abominable , we had to write this review at the restaurant . we ordered the calamari and an everything pizza . i ' ve licked a bag of flour with more flavor the breading on the calamari . and for the pizza , after the first bite , it felt as if i had taken a N oz shot of grease . the crust was like the cardboard cerial box that fell into your milk thin , mushy , and limp . pepperoni has seen better days in my dog ' s chow . the only thing more depressing than the food were the two anchors attached to the corners of each waiters ' mouth . how on this earth does this restaurant have a wall of awards for their pizza ? 
i have quite the love affair with risotto . chances are if i ' m at an italian restaurant and they have only one risotto dish amongst all the pasta and entree dishes , i will go for the risotto . so needless to say that i am all about a place that specializes in risotto . i don ' t have a gluten allergy so that ' s not a factor for me but it is convenient if i am dining with someone who can ' t eat gluten . their menu is so extensive i always get overwhelmed by all the options of risotto . i wish they had a risotto sampling option . i ' ve tried so man kinds , many of their daily specials and also a lot from the regular menu and they ' ve all been amazing . the rice is perfectly cooked and creamy and served in very generous portions with a great amount of flavor and seasoning . i can ' t recommend just one single one , just go and pick whatever calls your name in at moment . and then steal off your company ' s plates too . that ' s what my plan of action usually is . their thin breadstick appetizers are also a great complimentary start and they have a decent wine list as well . i ' ve never tried the pizza cause risotto will always win my favor but they look quite good as well . go early , they don ' t take reservations and theres usually a wait during peak hours
like many other bbq lovers who have traveled throughout the country , i was sure i knew what great brisket was . but my first visit to delaney bbq gave me a new perspective on the experience . descriptions like " succulent " or " melt in your mouth " sort of fit here , but cannot really convey just how delicious and rewarding my meal was . i choose equal portions of fatty and lean cuts , a half pound in total . as i watched the carving of one beautiful steaming brisket , with perfect smoke ring and pepper crusting , i was thinking that my trek to brooklyn was about to pay off . i chose coleslaw as a side and added few slices of white bread , and found a seat . i lifted my plate to breath in the glorious aroma and began to sense that this was going to be special . my first mouthful gave a rush of flavor that i knew would set a new hallmark for all of my future bbq life . i love this brisket and delaney bbq is a great place to enjoy it . the restaurant is casual , comfortable and charming , and the staff genuinely conveys your that you are very welcome here . put delaney bbq on your gotta-do list , right at the top . 
great little out-of-the-way eatery that will make you glad you took the time to find it ! if all brussel sprouts were like these , i ' d happily go vegetarian , but if that means never again eating this amazing meatloaf sandwich , well , never mind ! oh , and the mac cheese ? geez , is it good , or what ? ! ? the talent isn ' t restricted to the kitchen either . rye bartenders are experts , too ! this really is the perfect neighborhood bistro ! 
i think this place is closer to N . N stars but i ' m in a generous mood , after the generous portions served here . ilili looks so subtle from the outside all dark drapes and wood . i work nearby and have walked by it numerous times without even noticing the space . once you step inside though , the spacious room is inviting ( though a tad dark ) . we ordered the prix fixe menu , and were happy with all the dishes . we were suprised to get N appetizers each , and still had a difficult time narrowing down the choices . between me and my dining companion , we got to try N different dishes and N desserts between us . everything ranged from very decent ( hummus ) , to tantalizing ( clams steamed in harrisa butter ) . loved the chicken liver appetizer , seared with a sweet-tart glaze that helped cut the fattiness perfectly . sweetbreads were a rich little bite contained within a lettuce cup . entrees were a little less exciting after the flurry of appetizers . the supplemental lamb chop was tender and perfectly done , but the beef kabob was nothing special . portion size of the entrees were on par with the appetizers next time , i think i ' ll ask if i could just have three choices from the appetizer menu instead . can ' t wait to come back for the bone marrow ! 
food poisioning --- beware i have eaten at verita numerous times and always enjoyed the atmosphere , staff , drinks . however on a few occasions i noticed the center of the pizza ' s being underdone . i gave it no further thought as it seems to be how they like to prepare it . that all being said . i went to verita the other evening and had their mushroom pizza and was poisoned within two hours . for N hrs i vomited extreme disgusting sickness wreaking of verita and bad food . we called them to let them know that a case of heavy food poisoning resulted from their food . the girl on the telephone offered little sympathy and did not offer any type of reimbursement . i called back today only to be told they do not offer refunds regardless of the health issues resulting from their spoiled food . with this they have lost me as a customer will no longer receive N out of me for dinner most months . ------ avoid this place at all costs . i have the disgusting spoiled leftovers in my refrigerator and plan to get it tested to determine exactly what caused this horrific poisoning . in order to file a complaint with the health dept . verita - honor your customers . don ' t ignore a serious food safety issue . at least offer condolences . 
my neighborhood desperately needed a thai place after previously moving from a neighborhood ( upper-rittenhouse ) dense with thai eateries . i was a bit worried about the price ( it is a bit expensive for thai ) and usually find that most thai places can ' t live up to the cost , but this place was an exception . the food is made incredibly well and is awesomely tasty . the drunken noodle is legit . their currys are some of the best i have had creamy , spicy and fresh . the red curry is the best . your body will be in a twitchy , coma stupor as the spice constantly wakes you up from a melatonin heavy coconut milk . i highly recommend the por-piah-sod . it is a roll of everything good in this world crabmeat , chinese sausage , eggs , tofu , beansprouts , and cucumbers - fine guests for a taste-bud bubble bath . 
i went yesterday for the first time and loved it . i took my mom for her Nth b-day along with my N aunties and they had a blast and we were all wasted lol . the lychee martinis are so good and the price is just right . i can ' t wait to go back with my friends . i will be there next weekend . thanks verlaine ! ! 
came for brunch . we were late for our reservation but it wasn ' t a problem . the food was delicious and interesting . the restaurant was beautiful . the best part unlimited free sangria bar ! god bless calle ocho brunch . 
was here friday night with my family everything was excellent from apps to our entrees . burrata pie was delicious . best pizza i ever tasted ! there was about a N min wait , but it was worth it ! the place was packed the waitress was still very attentive to our table . great food service . 
i really wanted to like this place . i have friends that can ' t get enough of it . it ' s just not good . my daughter wouldn ' t eat her quesadilla so of course i tasted it and not only was it burned but the chicken inside tasted old . my wife wouldn ' t eat the food i brought home either . the N stars is for the decent staff . 
this is my new favorite comfort food restaurant ! the fried buttermilk chickens , cheesy grits , pickles pickles pickles , great beer selection and even better cocktail drinks will all have me coming back for more ! 
my husband took me their for dinner on my birthday and it was amazing i loved the food specially the muscle appetizer with the red sauce it was delicious and the staff was great they were very friendly and hospitable i felt like i was welcomed there , i wanna go there everyday . 
when i visited my cousins in new jersey and new york . . . coming to this spot was probably he highlight of my whole trip . i hated the east coast because it was hot as hell and humid as fuck . let me just say the west coast is definitely the best coast . . . without a doubt mans . . . but anyways . . . the food here was soooooo bomb . . . the sangrias booooomb . . . the service was boooomb . . . ambiance bommmmb . . . spending time with my east coast fam . . . bommmbbb . . . . oh and me and my cousin in law setting up my bf for a surprise happy bday stunt . . . hilllllarious hahahahas . . . it wasn ' t even my bf ' s birthday but we told the waiters it was so later on they started coming around with their drums and those mexican rattle thingys . . . wow that was intense . . . anyways bottom line . . . i love this spot mans . . . 
don ' t get me wrong , when you go to pat ' s you get a decent steak , but i think it has waaaaaaaaaay to much hype around it . this place has turned into a tourist trap . people drive anywhere from the tristate area just to get a pat ' s steak . if i was driving N minutes to an hour for a steak i would definitely go to steve ' s prince of steaks . steve ' s is ten times better , but i like it because there isn ' t always a lot of people there . so in my opinion a good traditional spot , but not the best in the city . 
i ' m not gonna lie . i ' m cheap . i went in here with cheap expectations and you know what , they met them . i got a been enchalada with taco shells on the side . the beans and cheese were fresh and it had a nice kick overall . it felt like i was at my grandmother ' s house and that ' s a great compliment since she is the queen of mexican food . really enjoyed this place and will be back without a doubt . 
N stars , but that ' s being a little generous . food was for the most part excellent . i was raised by good southern women , so i know my barbeque . both the ribs and the chicken were done just right . didn ' t try the sauces , but my dinner date ( a . k . a . dad ) loved them . french fries were perfect . and the red velvet cake . . . it took self-control to not lick the plate clean . that N star generosity is due to the service . scatterbrained would be the nice way to put it . the waiter was super friendly , but it ended there . brought me the wrong entree at first ( " oh sorry , i ' ve been punching in those sandwiches all day . " ) , but my correct meal was brought out seconds later . asked for the other half of the meal ( it was huge ) to be wrapped up , never saw it again . waiter went back to the kitchen for it , but it was too late . so they fired another half of the entree for me . disappointed i didn ' t get that half order of fries back . on the bright side , i was only charged for the cheaper , incorrect entree . great food , failure of a service . oh well . 
delicious . i love to go here for lunch . friendly guys here , they keep the roti coming if you ' re really getting into your dish . the saffron rice for dessert is an interesting thing you don ' t get many other places . enjoy ! 
i went there yesterday at N . N-N . N pm . there is only one waiter . i saw . it wan ' t busy anymore . there are just only N tables includes my table . the waiter doesn ' t have service mind . he didn ' t take care of the customer he , didn ' t pour the water . even the other table , he didn ' t take dishes out of the table . he pile the dishes on the table for longtimes . after i finished . i asked for check . i gave him . like just N tip and then i went out . he followed and asked me about the tips . i said i know , i didn ' t really satisfy . i didn ' t appreciate . and he said dont come back ! i ' m alway a regular costomer but i won ' t go there anymore . but another waitress was nice . except him worked on N N N at night . food was delicious . was terrible
great spot in the west village . really cute restaurant with a great atmosphere . reasonably priced and food was very good . to start veal meatballs were fantastic as was the artichoke salad . butternut squash puree soup was underwhelming . entrees steak was good but nothing spectacular . beef brisket dish with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts was delicious . highly recommend for something simple and solid ! 
cute spot ! friendly service with fresh food . not much else to say , give it a go ! 
this restaurant is one of my favorites in ny . prime location , restaurant has a great atmosphere with dim lights and exposed brick walls that give you a comfy feel . be aware , there will most likely be a wait , and they take cash only . there is a bar right next door , same owner as supper , it ' s a perfect bar to have a drink while you wait to be seated for supper . everything is great there . . . some suggestions for apps i recommend bruschetta also the melon with prosciutto . yum ! dinner N great dishes are veal scallopene alla milanese also the tagliatelle bolognese pasta . you will not be disappointed ! overall N stars . 
a cozier version of the perry st location with the same great latin fusion food . came here with some friends on a saturday night because one of my friends was craving their poquito picante cocktail . the food was very good , the music was lively , and the service was top notch . our waiter was extremely attentive , helpful and by the end of the night , the manager was giving us each his card telling us to call email him personally the next time we wanted to visit . i will definitely be back to this location . we didn ' t have any of the entrees but we had cocktails and split a bunch of the appetizers and a couple desserts poquito picante cocktail - N so we came here for this because my friend loves it but i ' m not a gin or cucumber fan . i was the only one who didn ' t love it . spicy something cocktail - N can ' t remember the name but there ' s one with pineapple , rum , ginger , jalapeno that i really liked . it was a tad sweet but i added some water and it was yummy . guacamole - N could ' ve been a little spicier but the flavor was incredible fish tacos - N so good we ordered a Nnd round . a grilled option would ' ve been nice . i ' d eat almost anything with that yummy chipotle sauce on top . beef and chicken empanadas - N pretty run of the mill but good papa rellenas - N fried mashed potato and manchego balls choclos - N soaked in butter so hard not to like arepas w short rib - N the short rib was good , but the arepa itself was super thin , almost cracker like , and i was hoping for a thicker corn patty that is a little more traditional like what you ' d get in colombia venezuela mini churros - N one of my favorite desserts so it ' s hard for me not to like it . comes with caramel and chocolate dipping sauces . yum . tres leches cake - N was ok . they tried to make it different with hibiscus and some kind of citrus flavor but just wasn ' t working for me . 
good food . cheap drinks . easily accessible via mass transit from hoboken and nyc . so many mullets . so very many mullets . 
between the beers and the balls , i am totally in pig heaven ! ! ! awesome beer selections , fantastic food , great service and a very welcoming environment ! ! i have been to the blind pig a few times now and each time i am more impressed . first of all i am a beer lover and john , the bartender , is always attentive to make sure you are pleased with your selection . as a matter of fact , he goes out of his way to make sure all of the customers are happy and taken care of ! ! along with the rest of the staff , john presents a welcoming environment when you come in , so much that it ' s hard to leave ! ! ( also , if you sit at the bar and have a few cold ones , i highly recommend the organic beef and pork jerky that is made locally for the restaurant . ) ok onto the real food . . . when i first tried the thanksgiving balls i thought i was in love . the lamb sliders were perfection and the sweet potato hash that was served with the pork chop is still in my dreams . when i went back again i had the new " blue balls " which are my current love affair . seriously , these things are made with true love . the braised short ribs and the blue cheese . . . come on . . . if you do nothing else in your life , you have try these things ! ! ! ! not to mention , the mussels and the salmon , which were also quite lovely . whether you are going out for drinks with friends or for a full meal with family , the blind pig will truly give you the experience you are looking for for a fantastic night out ! 
great pizza . 
just came here for dinner , had spring salad , ragu pasta , the charcuterie plate and the ricotta cheesecake . the food was not only uninteresting , but poorly prepared . the leaves in the salad arrived wilted , due to the large quantity of salt on the leaves . in addition , there were few other flavors , such as herbs or vinegar , in the salad to balance out the overwhelming flavor of salt . the pasta was served with a ragu that was watery and also lacking in flavor . the was comprised of shredded beef short rib - bits of it were crunchy - maybe was burnt from sticking to the bottom of the pot ? the tomato base did not taste of fresh ripe tomatoes and was lacking in complexity ( herbs and spices ) . the pasta itself was cooked quite well , just a touch other al dente , but the quality of the pasta suggests that it was cooked from the dried boxed variety - lacking the fresh chewy texture and also lacking in complexity due to the simple wheat base used to make the pasta . the ricotta cheesecake - maybe it wasn ' t a cheesecake , but either way it was not smooth and creamy . but the taste was nice , a little tart and a little sweet . however , the crust was again poorly constructed - soggy and again uninteresting in flavor . overall , food lacked flavor and balance and was poorly prepared . this would be alright - except for the price that was charged . expect to pay N pp for these courses without alcohol . 
cute idea , friendly staff , great burgers , fries and onion rings , but the downsides were significant the lemonade is horribly chemically and tastes like bug juice ( really , bobby ? you can ' t manage fresh ? ) and the restrooms were disgusting on our recent visit--garbage overflowing , dirty . they were out of mocha shakes but the black and white was good . i would try another one of these , but probably not this one . 
excellent . pizza . fresh quality ingredients . non greasy . . . allows you to eat more without getting bloated . this is an adult pizza . i tried their basic pizza which had just the right amount of everything including very fresh basil . nice atmosphere with a magnificent stove that everyone can see feel . hope they can keep the standards
i came here for dinner last night . i was pleasantly surprised by the interior layout of the restaurant . it has two levels and interesting woodwork designs . we ordered the matador since that seemed to be a popular choice . it ' s a lot of food . it feeds three people comfortably . the chicken was moist and flavorful . the plantains were good i especially liked the butter lemon sauce it came with . the salchipaps were mediocre . the fries were soggy and i wish they crisped the sausages . they could ' ve been more generous with the rice beans . bottom line , the food is good enough . 
good burger but kinda pricey . don ' t like their truffled beet salad and their smashed potatoes . not sure if its worth a second visit . 
the fresh mozzarella and basil pizza here was outstanding . probably second to di faras , but giving it five stars because it is a little different than difara ' s . we braved the line on valentines day thinking everyone was eating at fancy restaurants that night . boy we were wrong . it was like a single ' s appreciation event and the entire club went on a pizza field trip- the wait was well over an hour . and well worth it . the white wine was horrible , needless to say . so i ' d stay away from the wine ! 
figs is my favorite restaurant . delicious food and wonderful , friendly service . i live nearby , and everyone i have ever brought to figs has enjoyed their meal . the sesame crusted salmon and the grilled king shrimp are my favorite dinner entrees . their salads are always fresh and delicious . and i love the baked brie appetizer with lavender , honey , and almonds . you can ' t go wrong for brunch , either - great meals and delicious coffee . i also love the warm , cozy atmosphere . 
so i guess this is the chinese joint that hipsters go to . no matter , the place was legit . we were visiting nyc and opti wanted scallion pancake . this place had it on the menu so we went to check it out . great scallion pancake and great steam dumplings . this was a rare treat for me and it took a certain talent to eat them properly but after a few i was like a pig in a trough with these little morsels . i also like that the table were large circular tables where multiple parties were seated at so essentially you ' ll be rubbing elbows with strangers while scarfing down these dumplings and getting totally messy in the process . it ' s all good though because folks go to town on these dumplings and manners are an after thought . don ' t worry how you look just go at it . good time . cash only ! 
descent thai food
loved this place . N ) byob N ) great food . we got the mushroom cigars and each of us got our own dish - steak and fries , tuscan chicken , some lamb dish , and ahi tuna . absoultely delicious , especially the lam dish . N ) they take reservations even though the place a hole-in-the wall , N ) the waiter hostess ( place is small enough to have just one ) is really friendly and very good with recommendations . i am definitely going back there . 
delicious , inexpensive , and extremely filling . i would love to come back here next time i ' m in queens . the standouts here were the baby shark and pork arepas , as well as the braised beef platter . however , i would recommend just sticking to the arepas , because then you can try two or three different ones without killing yourself . they also have a venezuelan beer , which i thought was pretty interesting . not bad at all . 
having been to this restaurant several times , and comparing those experiences with the current one i had last night , i think it is fair to say that this restaurant has " jumped the shark ! " my wife and i arrived at N N pm being early for our reservation . lets say that real estate is prime in every aspect of this restaurant . front entrance is always cramped with people entering , people leaving , people waiting . we got lucky that two stools by the bar became vacant . with a good selection of single malt scotches and being adventurous , i did try a new whiskey ( can ' t call it scotch ! ) " yamazaki N year . " we sat down at a prompt N N right by traffic alley - table right by the bread station , meanwhile about N of the restaurant seating area is vacant . our waiter was very nice , got us more drinks while we gazed over the menu . our table had a wobble and seesaw effect as we took turns to put our elbows against the table . a different waiter from a different station took notice prior to me getting my waiters attention , and came by with a table wedge to make the table stable . we ' ve laughed with him , he was gracious , kind and fun . i had a similar incident the last time i was dinning here . i dropped my fork , and within seconds another waiter brought me a clean utensil without me asking . for appetizer pumpkin agnolotti , beat salad , and the chicken liver foie gras . the pumpkin agnolotti was a hit , the beat salad was ok to some but i liked it . but the foie gras was a total miss . the mouse was being over powered by the toasted bread , that you had a crunch of the bread and a butter texture , but you had no flavor of either goose , duck or chicken liver - but just salt . for the main course pan roasted chicken , steak au poivre ( steak and fries ) , and cote de boeuf ( to be shared ) . this is when everything goes south . the guest who had the steak au poivre ordered it medium well , and said it was heavy peppered . as for the cote de boeuf and it was served medium rare rather than medium of what was originally requested . waiter did acknowledge that it was a little rare and sent it back , while the side dish gratin was left lingering . it ' s awkward that your guests have their plates while you wait aimlessly playing with our thumbs and eating the side dish gratin . we encouraged our guests to continue eating and not to wait as we waited for our dish to return . ten minutes later the dish returns , my wife searches to find a slice with little fat , as most of it was just fat . she found the slice of her choice , and began carving the fat off , only to realized that it was doused with pepper . no where on the menu does it say " black pepper crusted " - and the same goes for the steak au poivre . it was totally inedible , and mind you , i like pepper . i ' ve gotten the notice of the waiter , and he went on to get the waiting manager . waiting manager was annoyed by my complaint , and believe me when i tell you we are not high fluting and maintenance people who goes to complain , but at N . N for a dish you don ' t care for , i have darn right to get your attention . the manager took the dish right off of the table ( with the gratin side , like we were going to devour it pro-bono ) . he asked us what we would like instead , and by this time especially when the dish went back and forth two times , my wife was turned off . my wife didn ' t want anything as she was completely turned off , and i said to the manger " anything that is not going to be peppered like this past dish . " he recommended the balthazar bar steak , and i told him please make sure it is medium . ten minutes later they deliver the dish . beautiful sere marks on the outside , but to the disappointment of being rare inside - again . i only ate N Nrd of the steak , ate most of the frits cause i was hungry , pushed the dish aside as i was turned off , and didn ' t want to complain again . they are more worried how their steak was going to look from the outside , that they ' ve put aside attention to the cooking of the steak ( very easy fix , lower the heat on the grill , and use a meat thermometer to gauge the interior temperature of the steak - but nah , we are balthazars , we know what we are doing - arrogant cooking ! ) it is amazing that waiters paid more attention to details when our table was wobbling , but knowing they ' ve delivered a disaster to a patron the first time , they never came back to find out how the Nnd dish was - they didn ' t want to know . trying to be upbeat , and felt awful that my wife really didn ' t eat anything , i thought desert was going to be my redemption . mediocrity is the best way i can describe it , as this review is already long and tedious i don ' t want to belabor it anymore . my bar tab and table bill came out to approximately N . N . i tipped fairly , due to the entire waiting staff as a whole was supper cool , and they were not at fault . though very disappointed for what was to be a wow experience . a N felafel would have been better than this meal . 
believe what you ' ve read about this place getting crowded and loud . it can be , but it ' s not always like this . as someone who lives within walking distance of this place , i try to stop by here for lunch on my days off from work or for tuesday trivia . if you come here during these times , you may be ( pleasantly ) surprised and appreciate it for what it is . a few of the bartenders servers are from off the boat , too ( if that matters . ) i ' ve eaten here several times and have yet to be disappointed - their sandwiches , salads and burgers are all great . also , if you ever want to experience something unique , stop by here where there ' s uk soccer setanta sports being broadcast here . i was here for the us vs . england world cup game - it was insane in termsof the crowd but this was the place to be ! this place often draws folks from the uk - both visitors as well as wh residents . also , on this past st . patrick ' s day there was an ireland-england rugby game on , with about a dozen irish folk cheering endlessly . after speaking with a few of these lads , i found out they all lived here in town . so if you go on a firday or saturday night , be prepared for crowds and noise ( which is amplified by live music ) . but if you go during the day or on a tuesday night when they have trivia , it ' s a totally different vibe . 
best burritos in connecticut , love the cart by the yale hockey rink
great service . our waitress was very friendly and prompt . most of the pitfalls were with the food . mussels appetizer was left under heating lamps too long , so a few were dried out . the dijon broth is also odd . caesar salad was completely saturated in parmesan cheese to the point where i had to abandon ship . my partner ' s burger completely fell apart after one bite . very tasty fries , though . the mac and cheese is basically baked ziti sans tomato sauce . it ' s just very greasy , stringy cheese with non of the creaminess you want from even baked mac . the grant ' s fashioned cocktail i ordered was basically a glass of straight bourbon . this is great in theory , or if you want to get totally blitzed , but not so great in practice when you want a cocktail to sip with your meal . the elements had potential , but the bartender was too heavy-handed . 
its ok . it just another italian store restaurant that ' s expensive and bombarded with tourists . had pasta there . the pasta was was homemade but tough and there was little flavor to the sauce . the pizza was better choice . if anything i go there for sweet milk gelato but even thats expensive so its a very once in awhile treat . 
just tried the new almond latte . . . almond milk . . a little syrup . . . . perfect . . great place to relax and enjoy treats . . great glueten free items ! 
i ' d wanted to impress a business associate mentor , who loves japanese cuisine , so i yelped and googled and trip advisored my little heart out looking for just the right place . this came up over and over again . the night we went was super busy , but the service withstood it . the food is supremely excellent . i ' ve since been back many times , mostly . . . 
this is simple-- don ' t go on a party night when there is a sports something or another to be seen . i made this mistake , and it sorta ruined what could ' ve otherwise been a damn good experience . the burgers ( around N ) --yummy burger , could ' ve been bigger , but it was a good size . the fries-- useless . the mcsorely ' s ale that tastes like candy and is N . N on tap- very usefull ! there was a line for seating-- i didn ' t even get a chance to see what the back of the place looked like ( or how many seats were back there ) . there ' s a nifty little heated bar at the front window-- try to get that-- don ' t touch the pipe between the door and that bar ( hot ! ! ! ) just grab a stool , get a guy to order you a burger ( sexist-- i know-- but it got me my burger right ! ? ) -- don ' t forget to tell him you want that beer too-- pay for the round ( N and no more sexist right ? ! ) let me know if you ever find this place empty-- cause i ' ll come down with a gaggle of my friends and ruin that for ya . o ) bistro burger yum
great place to eat empanadas ( i ' m colombian and therefore an empanada expert ) the service is fantastic and i recommend you get their hot chocolate , it ' s the original and delicious corona colombian chocolate ( i checked with the waiter x ) ) . overall a great place to eat , can ' t wait to go again . 
disappointing . broth was ok . noodles were undercooked . gyoza was average . overpriced . no take-out . i doubt i ' ll be back . 
excellent vodka rigatoni . the owners and waitstaff are lovely . have been coming back for years . 
my grandmother used to work here until she was into her late N ' s making the thin crust pizza back when the place was called kens town tavern . ken unfortunately passed away not too long ago , the place was renamed maggies town tavern . always had good food , always a fun place . 
i really wanted to like this place , and while i do love the decor , everything else about the experience was pretty terrible . our order was messed up ( only N out of N dishes were right ) , and it was excruciatingly expensive for what was meh to downright bad food ( what on earth is going on with that testa dish ? ) in teeny-tiny portions . it ' s everything people hate about brooklyn , down to the blaring ironic hip hop . we left the place feeling duped . 
such a fan ! it ' s a lot smaller than i thought , but it ' s really cozy and cute . great southern menu like jalapeno cornbread , jambalaya , and chili . i got the mushroom and black bean burger which was amazing and had the perfect kick of spiciness . side of sweet potato fries rounded out the dish quite nicely . i hear they have a great brunch menu that i ' d love to check out soon . 
went here the Nst week they opened this location . the roast beef was overcooked on the dryish side and the hero was a bit stale . chalked it up to being newly opened having some growing pains the second time i went months later , i skipped the roast beef . the hero was even more stale this time . nothing in the steam trays was fresh and the service was friendly if not a bit slow . it seems that john ' s product is suffering at the hand of opening too many locations . 
vernick is a place i would definitely take a date and hopefully you get the cute seats on the second floor by the outdoor balcony . as far as the food goes . it was pretty good . the ones i recommend is definitely try the pea and bacon toast . i still drool thinking about it . the grilled octopus was prepared very well and the hamachi were the ones that stuck out ! of course dinner wouldn ' t be complete without dessert . we went for the mini cookie sandwiches . they were sooooo good and definitely helped end the meal well ! for service , i thought it was a little bit slow . we waited a little too long in between plates and i felt like my server was gone alot and didn ' t really check back as much . 
small , intimate , genuine ! this tiny bistro is extremely charming and does have real brazilian food , specially the delicious northern cousine of brazil . ( please order the acaraj ! ! ! ) we came here in a thursday night , and they were extremely friendly , wonderful service and great food ! just please , get some better desert choices , like maracuja sorbets ? some cake ? of course , would be nice to have some vegan desserts as well , but i do appreciate the chef ' s special vegan selection , just wish it had plantains or bananas in it ! 
didn ' t realize putting a bunch of chandeliers would attract so much attention and very long waits . the food here is pretty good but there are so many thai options in the neighborhood that are equally as good and doesn ' t have a hoard of people . one time i ordered a curry dish that left a rather disgusting aftertaste . . . like some sort of cleaning solution . 
food was great ! make sure you try the beef pepperoni on your pizza . 
went here on a whim with a friend , and the food was delicious . dishes i can vouch for --chips and dip . the kitchen was actually out of waffle chips , so they baked the butter-onion dip onto a flat bread . amazing . --shrimp and grits . creamy but not watery , didn ' t skimp on the ( fresh and sweet ) shrimp . --pumpkin ice cream with gingersnap cookies ! mmm . i should also mention the staff was friendly and accommodating no attitude here . i plan to go back . 
i met someone here for dinner . never even heard of this place until he picked it out . i was pleasantly surprised by everything . the ambiance is really cute , but trendy at the same time . the food was amazing , as was the service . we had a hilarious waitress who made our date much more fun . my date wasn ' t too fond of his main course ( some type of pork chop ) , but my dish was amazing . i got fish and substituted some vegetables for whatever came with it . we finished off with dessert and another round of drinks . 
both the food and service were exquisite . however , we chose a bottle of wine from their list and the waiter returned to inform us they were out of stock . we chose a second bottle of wine and he returned with the same news . finally we requested that he simply bring some sort of riesling , to which he returned with a bottle of berlinger . while it was better than none at all , it was hardly what we would have chosen . 
let me first say this is a review of respect more than personal preference . i can understand why people would love it . the hot sauce is out of this world , the portions are massive , and the price cant be beat . i give it to these guys , they know what people want . now my side , the rice is this omg bright orange radioactive color and it passes through like acorns while on the toilet . the hot sauce was so freaking hot when i put a little bit ( i think korean spicy is a joke ) it just heat and little flavor and again passes through you like a pissed off godzilla . i gave it N tries and N terrible experiences and the lines are long but its expected for something so popular so no penalty . i just know i won ' t be trying it again . so again i can respect why people love this and they do what they do very well and you ' ll have lunch and dinner in one portion . just be prepared to use the bathroom with some painkillers . 
great place to watch a game , but don ' t go there to eat ! 
we went there with my wife for a date night . it was a great experience the place is nice and cozy ( we got the window table ! ) . service and food were great . we keep this place for our special occasions ! 
saw aaron sanchez from food network rave about the choc . pizza , so this one was bookmarked i went with my brunch buddy , you know how we roll ! ! they had venezuela coffee-yum ! as you walk in , enter this gorgeous place , transformed to this heaven of chocolate on top pipes -saying chocolate running thru them . the center of the place decorated with different chocolate products , we were greeted seated . the employees were personable . we ordered the french toast with apple , cinnamon , these N cute little miniature beakers , one with white chocolate sauce , other milk chocolate . it was crumbled with quite milk chocolate pieces all around , sprinkled with cinnamon-omg ! ! it had nice texture , bread was very light airy , just the difference in texture flavors , quite remarkable ! ! we did split it . of course , delicious . we will definitely be coming for just dessert or lunch again . . try something new ! ! great ! ! ! ! can ' t wait to try to chocolate pizza , too . 
amazing atmosphere great customer service and amazing food
i didn ' t know how big eataly really was until i stepped into the main dining area and was all of a sudden overwhelmed by alll the food ! ! being a die hard food lover i found myself in the perfect play ground . seafood so fresh it hardly smelled of ocean ? squid in pasta by the pound ? cured meats and cheeses ? i was soo excited i could hardly contain myself . okay so i exagerrate a little but i was seriously impressed by fresh squid ink pasta and the many raviolis that were for sale at the pasta counter . the highlight of my night however was eating at il pesce . it was absolutely fantatic and i am still thinking about their diver scallop crudo today . it was really amazing and i don ' t think i ' ve had fresher on this side of the pond ever ! ! i ' m saving my il pesce review for the il pesce yelp page because seafood that good needs it ' s own special review written with loveee . 
i don ' t really want to like it here , but i still do . it is an incredibly weird mix of people -- suburban visitors , babies dressed in gingham ties , occasional hipsters , people who write " cock " on jenga blocks , N year old professorial types out w the professorial bros -- i just can ' t figure it out and i think it ' s better the less i think about it . i am not really into the stephen starr restaurant industrial complex and try to avoid his reach , but i went here a few times last year for nerd nite and ( ugh why ! ) i like it a lot . i like that you can play jenga at your table , i like the beer prices during happy hour , i like the giant pretzels and the weird condiments they come with , i like sitting outside in the summer , i like that it fits a lot of people , i like the gravel in the biergarten , i like the system they have for ordering food , i like the beer selection . i will continue to reluctantly really like frankford hall . 
nice clean place , food a 
nice atmosphere . beach please was delicious . . i had a blast ! ! ! 
pure thai cookhouse is a gem of a restaurant ! it ' s a small restaurant so if you go during peak lunch and dinner hours , expect to wait N minutes or so for a table . i suggest going with a smaller party because most of their tables are N-seaters . they deliver so if you ' re fortunate enough to live in the area , problem solved ! Nth avenue offers a wide variety of thai food shams but they can ' t fool me ! i ' m in love with pure , their service , their cheap prices , and their food ! the chicken curry puffs were all the rage when i last went so if you enjoy chicken curry in dumpling form , then i recommend you start off with a plate as an appetizer . my girlfriends and i ordered pad thai , pad see ew , pad jae , and their ratchaburi crab and pork thai noodles . their pad thai and pad see ew were splendid . it ' s the best that i ' ve had so far . their pad jae dish is a vegetarian friendly dish sauteed in a light tamarind sauce i loved it . they didn ' t skimp out on the vegetables and tofu , which was a huge plus for me . but everyone and their mothers were raving about the ratchaburi thai noodles . make sure you order it with the dry noodles . the noodle consistency is slightly like that of ramen noodles and they cook the noodles in a subtle sauce that is both sweet and tangy . it is then served with a hefty amount of pork and crab meat . it ' s an authentic thai dish that other thai restaurants can ' t even put on their menus because it ' s hard to imitate . you may be wary of trying a new dish but i assure you that you will enjoy the ratchaburi thai noodles . bon appetit . happy eating . 
decor N N -dim and great for a date or just to hang out with friends service N . N N -she disappeared numerous times , i went up to her as she was chatting with her coworkers and acted as if i wasn ' t her table . food N N -the first bite is great and you ' re thinking " wow , this dish is so good " . eat half the entree and you ' ve already downed N-N glasses of water . that ' s how salty all the dishes were . -patatas bravas was probably the tapas of the night . first few bites , you ' re thinking wow these taste great . eat a few more and you ' ve already downed N glasses of water . -montado de setas ( N ) was a decent size salad with toast points , wild mushrooms , goat ' s milk cheese and pine nuts -coca de butifarra y piquilos ( N ) was great . . . . for the first few bites but then got salty . 
very classic , modestly located restaurant . my friends and i were dressed up ( just a typical shirt tie , dress ) like it seemed like everybody there was . we were offered an alcohol menu although we ' re underage , which comes to show the audience of this restaurant -- professional business people perhaps ? i ordered a rigatoni focaccia , and it was delicious . the texture moistness of the chicken was on point , and since i love sun-dried tomatoes , this was the perfect dish for me . the service was great , as well . our waiter kept coming to check on us and made sure that our drinks were refilled and that we were doing okay -- something i noticed a lot of the other restaurants in ny lacked . 
i dont get the ramen craze . it was all just ok . try ivan ramen on the les first . 
i have to be honest i was sad to see almanac close it ' s doors , ( the former tenant ) . i ate there a few times a week for lunch and shopped for fresh groceries in the process . they had great local fare that ' s hard to find just steps from your front door . . . it took me a few weeks to stop in and try the new cafe chismosa . upon first glance i noticed a very clean look . definitely leaning towards minimalist . comfortable tables spread throughout with a couch and coffee table in the back . . nice surprise ! their special the day i visited was a spicy mushroom soup . i immediately indulged and i was not disappointed . i ' m the person who has the entire top of my stove lined with ghost pepper hot sauces . this soup is spicy and amazing ! my second small dish was a tostada topped with ceviche , home made guac , and some other latin accompaniments . i was floored , so fresh , so tasty , so yes ! i washed everything down with a homemade hibiscus tea that had the most awesomely peculiar flavor . do i sound excited ! i am . i hated to see almanac go but i ' m glad that the new addition to my hood is so damn good ! i wish them nothing but success . . . rockysquirrel
i ' ve been to maggies a few times in the past month and i have to say what a great place . i always sit at the bar have a few drinks and an appetizer . i was there this sunday and what a great time . the bartender was so entertaining . . . can she really handle a bar , think her name was shannon ! ! ! ! i had the raw clams . . . amazing ! ! maggies is excellent and i highly recommend it to my friends . 
woodrow ' s was amazing ! id checked it out once before hosting my bday party there and it was perfect . the atmosphere is friendly and easy going , they have a great downstairs for parties and a yummy bar menu . looking forward to going back . 
beautiful restaurant with savory , authentic dishes . service is prompt , limited bar with specialty drinks . delivery or pick-up . i sometimes use it as a lunch meeting spot while in new haven and its always a pleasure . 
love the crab meat fried rice . mmmmm . 
i love this place . i have been going for years and the food just keeps getting better . the herb crusted pork chops are to die for . 
really good food the roasted eggplant and the kebab it ' s so yummy i really enjoy it
brunch . returned here for lunch last sunday and were pleasantly surprised that ngam offers a brunch menu ! we were not expecting it--and they gladly made the regular , dinner menu available as well . we made a reservation via opentable N minutes before heading arriving--but we didn ' t even need it . not that they weren ' t bustling my favorite thing about this brunch , aside from their thai inspired innovations ( like thai coffee drizzle on their french toast , and other subtleties ) on brunch classics , was that we could walk right in , to a comfortably patronized but not overcrowded floor in a spacious restaurant with high ceilings . the two of us ordered way too much food ( their N brunch special includes an entree , a side like our super spicy brussels sprouts , and bottomless mimosas and bloody mary ' s--with a thai twist of course ) plus a tom kha soup from their regular menu because it was a chilly day . . . . our server was very very helpful in helping us choose he explained the differences in dishes and helped us balance the flavors in our choices . they were maybe slightly understaffed to attend to my daydrinking ( it was after all bottomless crunch cocktails--i suppose this usually means N or N for most sunday brunchers . . . ) and the large space meant we sometimes had to wait or gesture wildly for the servers ' attention . however , we had wanted a quiet lunch to take our time and talk over , and we got it . sunday brunch , meet ngam . ( please , don ' t all run there and ruin my spot now . . . ) oh , and -- order the chiang mai fries . 
the only reason why this place gets a star is because they have beer on tap , an espresso bar , decent live music , and a happy hour special - and the interior is worth checking out . unfortunately i live a block away from this place and consider the food inedible . like many people who have given moto similar reviews , i feel disappointed . when moto first opened , it was the gem of the neighborhood . people would travel from far away places for the moto experience . great paninis and appetizers . reasonably priced . quaint . live bluegrass . all of this existed in this teeny tiny space right under the j m z line . with the best date cake ever . now , the even the date cake is dry , or . . . something . yeah - the service is crappy , but it never really bothered me until the food turned gross . they serve wilted greens ! ! ! ! seriously ? ? ? and use frozen vegetables ! ! ! ! ! need i say more ? 
not so happy with my food . . . . . . . . . . 
don ' t really understand what all the hype is about this place . stopped by here for dinner with the gf and that was my first mistake . definitely not a good place to go if you want to have a conversation over a meal . the seating is cramped and the acoustics leave you shouting across the table . the decor is interesting , as they have a whole chair , desk and lamp hanging on the ceiling as if the whole room had been turned upside down . usually that ' s a warning in my book when restaurants try to get clever with the atmosphere instead of focusing on the food . given the homey feel and word of mouth , i was hoping the food would change my mind . first the appetizers . we ordered arancini di carne ( rice balls ) and the mozzarella pizzaiola and my were they disappointing . the rice balls were flavorless and crumbled on impact - its impossible to pick them up with a fork . there wasn ' t much meat inside and the sauce around it added nothing but an oily mess . the mozzarella fared a tad better , but was ultimately nothing to write home about . on to the main course , i ordered the michele pizza while the gf ordered the special seafood pasta entree of the day . since i don ' t eat much seafood i can ' t comment much on the dish , but the gf was unimpressed . my pizza was similarly blah . i ' d gotten rave reviews from friends about the pizza and was excited to try it , but it was altogether ho-hum . when it came out , the heat of pizza along with the toppings i chose left the center of the pie very moist and flimsy . it tasted okay , but the mushy-ness of the first bite wasn ' t too pleasant . the place gets packed , so you need to continually flag down your waiter . we had to wait for menus , utensils , the bill , etc . and my water glass was continually empty . -N star . so much for the hype - there are better options out there ! 
i ' m a huge fan of authentic italian style pizza , and modern is one of my favorite pizzerias ! absolutely delicious ! i like this pizzeria better than pepe ' s and sally ' s . i actually recommend the simpler margherita pizza , it ' s what they are best at . if you find yourself in new haven , this is a must have ! 
gf got saigon shack pho with brisket and meatballs . the broth was good and meatballs were great . good flavor . i got the " spicy " brisket bahn mi . . . . not spicy at all . . . . at all . . . so i threw some siracha on it , never crazy about doing that bc of sirachas strong flavor . . . anyway it was pretty good , next time im going to ask if they could mix the veggies and meat prior to putting in the bun as i only had either all meat or all veggie bites and i think it would have been nice all together . 
was there last night with N friends for my birthday . could not have asked for anything better from this place . the place is not too small and not too large . service felt personalized even though there were N other groups there . the byo feature was a definite plus . i ' ll be honest and say i don ' t really remember leaving but i do remember the food . everything i ate was incredible . we had mac n cheese for the table ( N orders ) , a number of bbq rib sandwiches , a chorizo burger , a regular burger , and an order of muscles . some had sweet potato fries and others had the spicy fries . and these weren ' t just spicy for the sake of having a spicy fries option . they were damn good spicy fries . and no they weren ' t burn-a-hole-in-your-sphincter spicy . they were actually flavorful , spicy fries . i am definitely headed back for more . btw they even have a tv there in the event you absolutely need to watch the game . we had them put the knicks on and all was right with the world that evening , in addition to it being my birthday . to sum up using an entirely tangential point , this place was so enjoyable that we had our host ( and owner btw ) poor shots for not just our table but the other tables as well . . . some of whom actually drank them and others who preferred to remember some of their saturday night . oh and we had not one but two chef interactions . super nice and friendly guy . do yourselves a favor a go to this place . we don ' t want them going anywhere . final final final words . i ' ve been to fette sau and this place is better , period . the vibe here is better and the service is better . hell , there is no service at fette sau and good luck finding a seat at that place . fette sau is good but you aren ' t doing anything there other than eating . juniper is a place to actually enjoy yourself while having great food . though let me also say that this isn ' t just a bbq place . so if you are looking for straight up brisket by the pound , go elsewhere . but if you crave what juniper ' s menu offers , definitely come . 
delicious . if you ' re new to indian food , cross culture is a great place to sample if you ' re already an indian food fan , it will certainly satisfy you . for a beginner , i recommend chicken malai kabab ( grilled garlic and ginger marinated white meat chicken ) with kachumber and raita accompaniments ( order these a la carte ) . also recommended lentil daal makhani , any masala dish ( very creamy ) and aloo gobhi ( cauliflower and potatoes ) . byob -- there ' s a liquor store in the shopping center if you forget to plan ahead . sparkling wine ( champagne or prosecco ) or crisp beer work well with both spicy and creamy foods . service is good . very pleasant decor . 
i would put this on my list of date spots with the exception that it is loud . but it was soo cute inside . i loved they turned a residential home into a cute restaurant . you will walk by like we did if you are not looking carefully . alta is in a residential area and i don ' t remember seeing a sign . service - a -ok , efficient food - yummmmy cost - errr i felt a bit on the pricey side for tapas but i guess i am in nyc bacon wrapped dates olives - i am not a huge olives person but this was ok fried goat cheese - i love cheese but i don ' t care for goat cheese but damn this was really good . lamb meatballs - im not huge about lamb ! i never order it , to me lamb always taste pretty gamey but these lamb meatballs tasted nothing like lamb . yum wish i had a few now . foie gras au torchon - i have had better foie but since there is a ban in cali . figured i should get it any where i can . carpaccio of black bass - did not taste like i was eating fish . this was pretty damn good crispy brussels sprouts - didn ' t know brussels can taste so damn good pulled pork empanadas - one of the best dishes we had enormous whole shrimp - ehh just tasted like grilled shrimp - i ' ll pass on this next time roasted pork belly confit - if you like crunchy pork skin this is a dish to get i loved this one . squid ink paella - very good paella but for N bucks for a really small dish err i felt a bit ripped off . all in all everything we had was pretty good a must try restaurant ! ! 
great food , good sports bar atmosphere . lots of flat screen tvs playing practically every game on . nice lunch hour escape from parsippany . 
we ' ve been going there for many years . have known neal , the owner , since he had his amazing restaurant bouillabaisse on atlantic ave many years ago . food never disappoints , so fresh delicious . and the best part is that you can bring your own wine ( s ) . and because it ' s so tiny , waiting time can be a bit of a drag , but don ' t despair , because it ' s worth the wait ! a warm , cozy , and romantic place for dinner ! my favorite is the cioppino , it ' s the best ! continentalphotovideo . com
i chowed down on the cuban-style corn until the last kernel was gone , and didn ' t even notice my mouth was on fire until i was done . this , all during a new york summer , in a restaurant with not the greatest ventilation . all worth it . the restaurant came recommended from three separate people , so i couldn ' t wait to check it out . cuban-style corn and a cuban chicken sandwich more than did the trick until dinner . it ' s on a quiet street at the epicenter of nolita , little italy proper and the little boutiques the city has become famous for , and it ' s cheap -- perhaps one of the best attributes a quality eatery can have in the pricey big apple . 
adding minca to my list of favorite ramen joints . the noodles are perfectly chewy and have a good tenacity to them . the spicy miso is piping hot and intense in all the right ways that soups packed full of flavor should be . the shoyu is also quite packed with flavor though not quite as intense as the spicy miso . it ' s a small hole in the wall and doesn ' t have very many seats . come off peak hours to get seated quickly . 
 - artery clogging goodness - everyone says the chicken cheesesteak is better , but that steak cheese steak looks damn good - with that said , the chicken cheesesteak is muy delicioso , if the steak cheesesteak is better , it must taste like heaven - provolone fries just be sure not to be the one that takes the fry that the cheese is stuck two , thus removing a bock of cheese with one fry . . . . like my wife did - - although the gremlin is a classic , it is definitely diabetes in a cup sweeet - - not really an eat in option , altho there are a few stools , otherwise there ' s just enough room to make an order and get out tips - if you ' re eating in , do ishkabibble ' s ii , down the street . i wish i had known - know what you ' re ordering before you order , you ' re going to get a lot of groans as you casually contemplate which toppings to get - get a fork , the chicken cheesesteak can get sloppy
i went the night before thanksgiving with two friends . we arrived very early ( N Npm ) and were quickly seated . the service was so-so . the food was very good ! the reason i am giving a N star rating is that when we went to pay , i tried using my opentable . com checks . the server took them along with my credit card for the additional payment and within minutes came back saying they do not accept them . i was clearly annoyed and advised him that this is not right - they are clearly a member of the opentable . com restaurant program . he went back and asked his manager ( we could see the very quick conversation ) and came back again , still saying no . the manager did not even have enough professionalism or relationship building skills to walk over and explain , but rather stood hiding at the back of the restaurant ( we could see that also ) . basically , they use the system to accept the reservation , but refuse to offer the benefits as a result of using the system . beware of this ! i will not be back ! 
it is as good as it gets for a great , friendly , delicious neighborhood spot . the staff was attentive , the crostini were terrific , the pasta and mains just perfect . kal , the owner , was sweet and easy going and solicitous without being overbearing or inauthentic . the house made desserts were really great . the backyard was a really pleasant place to eat , the wine was great and well priced . we will definitely be back regularly and cent anni is a great addition to the burgeoning restaurant scene on franklin ave . we ' ve lived in the neighborhood for decades and are so grateful for cent ' anni and the other great restaurants on the avenue . 
went with a party of four . we all had similar thoughts about this place . pros excellent service . from valet to waiters , the service is great and friendly . excellent sangria ! flavorful , not too sweet . cons the food was mediocre . i think we would have enjoyed it much better but for the amount of salt used on every dish , from the appetizers to the paella which was basically inedible . the rodizio was average not the best we ever had . it ' s unfortunate because the restaurant is cozy , the staff is great , but the food was mishandled by someone with a very heavy hand for salt - try using some onion , garlic , herbs instead . 
i was so wowed by this meal , i can ' t wait to return . i had a coupon and wanted mexican food . . . plus there were a lot of good reviews . the restaurant is non-descript but very cozy . i was kind of annoyed that their happy hour was only if you sat in the bar , but oh well . i ordered the house margarita and for dinner , we had the moljacete ( N for two ) . the entr e was a mixture of meats and veggies with warm corn tortillas . it was spicy but fantastic . we also ordered the rice with manchego . . . it had corn in too , ugh , so yummy . my daughter ' s cheese quesadilla was good , too . we also ordered the guac and added goat cheese . delicious . my margarita was N and really good . it was a generous size , too , and i left feeling a little tipsy . score ! ! i loved our meal . prices are a little steep but the food is well worth it . 
i really dislike giving bad reviews and i ' m quite surprised this place has such high ones at that . i rarely ever say that i don ' t enjoy a meal however this thai joint really disappointed me . the service was excellent , but i ' ve honestly never had such bad pad thai in my entire life . maybe it was the day that i went ? or perhaps the chef changed . . . i have no idea . but because of the high reviews i ' ve decided to drop by and give it another try when i ' m in the area . 
truly impressed- bartaco a wonderful neighboring addition to barcelona in west hartford center . bartaco has a beautifully designed interior - somehow beachy yet sophisticated - that makes for a killah ambiance . the tacos were superb ( for not being from the nexcali truck ) . i sampled the spicy chorizo , pork al pastor and beef ( N . N each ) , but i ' m dying to try the duck , lamb barbacoa , and thai shrimp . guacamole was phenomenal . since i was with a fairly large group , we shared several chef ' s selection platters - these trays are excellent for trying a lidda bit of everything . guac , tamales , tacos sides ( the spicy cucumber salad was divine ) . can ' t wait to go back for some of the other small plates options hint snapper ceviche . if you ' re in the mood for cocktails , i ' d highly recommend the rosita hibiscus infused gran centenario reposada rosemary , pear nectar and cranberry . 
i was really looking forward to this place but the greeter really killed the mood . she has her ipad and inputs peoples group sizes which is supposed to keep her on track with wait times . she estimated our small group to N-N min . as we waited , people kept coming in and she took them . the place is small . . . no . . . tiny . very tiny . we could ' ve sat down numerous times , but she does a poor job coordinating . do not come with a group of N or more . they can ' t handle that business . it ' s been an hour . a group of N walked it and she told them to wait in a corner where there ' s seriously N people waiting and they all look like sardines . food ? after getting it , it was good but definitely not worth the wait . poor service , decent food , and extremely poor real estate ! ! no thank you . 
my first ootoya experience was back in bangkok years ago . . . i remember falling in love with the food right away . i recently came to this location and again i was not disappointed . my friend was already in the area so he put his name down and waited at the bar area . meanwhile , i was still navigating my way around the city ( service change - subways on weekends ) . his name was then called N mins after i got there ( he said it was about a N minute wait ) . we ordered the salmon sushi and shima hokke . i love the presentation and how delicious the dishes were ! i also enjoy sitting at ootoya . . . love how simple the decor was . high ceiling , very zen like , clean and elegant . it would be a great place for special occasions with the loved ones , date nights or even just a casual random night out . service was also top notch . . . the staff was attentive and very friendly . even though it was a saturday night and the line outside was long , we did not feel rushed to leave at all . 
eataly is obviously a great restaurant and grocery shopping place , but i had one unfortunate episode there . on a week night , the place was going to close in about thirty minutes , it was aound N N pm , and i was checking out some grocery items i had purchased in the front part of the store . i was instructed to place the items on the counter ( the front section ) , which i did , and abruptly the two front cashiers ( one of them was a female supervisor ) became rude to me , saying that " it is not the right place for such heavy items " . they were argumentative and sort of arrogant . actually there was no sign stating the contrary , and i had purchased similar items and checked them out at same counter before . i thought , these people showed no concern for my loyalty as a customer , and offered no other option for me to check out the items that i had purchased . it was late , and i was completely left on my own , i scrambled around and got lucky that another counter was still opened in the back section of the store ( close to Nrd street ) . that cashier was actually nice and helpful ! the place itself is terrific , but hiring the wrong people will tarnish its reputation . 
besides the well preserved deer head on top of us during the meal , i definitely enjoyed my meal . it was prompt service along with very affordable prices ! i had the red borscht which came with dumplings , while my husband ordered the white borscht soup . then we shared the meat platters , since we like to see what might be best to get next time and yes sharing is caring . i felt adventurous and ordered the veal meatballs in a cream sauce and my hubby got the beef goulash . the portions here were huge and yes there is enough to take home for the next day ' s lunch . just filling , but happily full of yummy food . 
odeon is authentically good food is seriously good great wines by the glass ambiance is paris were it between the hudson and east rivers . odeon serves one of the best french onion soups you can find here ( we have tried many ) . . . . rivals la luncheonette on Nth ave . hangar steak is memorable . . . . and try the pudding . most fun eat at the bar to sample various wines to pair with your meal . 
i ' ve eaten here well more than N times ( and probably should get my cholesterol checked ) . this pizza rocks . to me , beats pepes hands down . why ? crust is crispier and the cheese has a little more bite . toppings at pepes are a little better though . calzones are very good too and a nice change . sandwiches subpar compared to their other offerings . one thing i dont like is how salty the dough is . i could get clinically dehydrated eating a medium alone . i would also have to admit though , that eating a whole salty pizza means its a really good pizza . and to top it off , their waitstaff includes a few of the most attractive women i ' ve seen in new haven . i ' m not sure how safe that is considering that they ' re slinging out salty cheesy greasy awesome artery clogging pizzas , and having a couple of heart-stoppers bringing them to you . hope they have a defibrillator in there . 
never had anything but the square trenton pie , but this pie is so good it gives delorenzo ' s a run for the money--grew up in trenton with great italian restaurants on every corner , most gone now , and highly recommend this pie for anyone nostalgic for the pies of their childhood ! note a trenton pie should be so thin and light that one person could just about eat the whole thing , and it should be seasoned so well that you don ' t have to touch the shaker jars on the table . this pie qualifies for sure . 
incredible food and amazing service ! i ' ve gone there multiple times , and each time i ' m amazed at how good the food is . i ' m always impressed ! the service is quick and good ! i recommend this place , and it ' s great for a night out . it gets crowded , so making a reservation is not a bad idea . 
i ' ve been here a few times and have always left happy . it ' s unusual to find a restaurant of this caliber right upstairs from a grocery store . the food really is quite good - i ' ve sampled many of the appetizers - the ones that stand out in my mind are the olive bread pudding and sausage sampler . for dinner , i have always ordered the hamburger ( boring , i know ) . i have them add blue cheese and bacon and it ' s great - served on a unique garlic pretzel roll that ' s really quite tasty . other people in my family have been more adventurous and are always very pleased with what they order ( some even rave ) . i ' ve also been for sunday brunch and enjoyed that they take reservations and that it makes for a relaxed meal . i can ' t really comment too much on the brunch food , as i had a bagel with lox ( note - they butter and toast the bagel unless you ask otherwise ) . however , my friend had the french toast and it was delicious . the only issue this place seems to have is the service - we started going when the restaurant had just opened and i expected the initial growing pains to subside with time - they haven ' t . even servers who i recognize since the place opened still seem to lack confidence familiarity with the menu . the service isn ' t horrible or anything , just needs some fine tuning - it wouldn ' t stop me from coming back . definitely a great addition to the area - a something for everyone kind of menu . 
as a celiac , i ' ve been here quite a few times , and finally i ' m annoyed enough to review , as i find it overpriced and overrated . the seating is tight and the service impatient , but i don ' t mind that as much as their risotto , which is not merely al dente , but the rice is grainy , hard and uncooked ( inside each grain--not enough time to soak up properly boiling broth ) . also , the ingredients for the many combos on the menu are tossed in at the last minute , rather than cooked into it , making for a flavorless hodgepodge . it ' s nice to offer Ns of combos--and to make each " on order " but better would have been N-N properly made and flavored risottos of the day . the salad was ok but way overpriced for unimaginative lettuce with some bell peppers . the cookies and desserts are overly sweet , way too frosted , using some gf mix that ' s gummy and grainy . bottom line i make better risotto at home , and far better desserts . the only thing that ' s good here are the breadsticks ! 
just like other reviewers mentioned , this place is off the charts good . so much so that i am afraid my daily visits to the restaurant cannot be that healthy ( sushi is good . . . but too much of everything and . . . ) . excellent food , cozy place , nice staff . . . you name it . the chefs are so inventive , and you just must try one of the house special roles . i would recommend either " brooklyn bridge " ( comes with a special eel sauce ) or " fashion " ( shrimp tempura predominately a few special sauces on top ) . you want to have a great sushi experience --- nothing to think about , iron chef is your place . the only con is that the place is relatively small , so it can fill up rather quickly . that can translate into a N min wait on a busy dinner night . . . but when i come to think of it , if it were any bigger the restaurant would not probably be as good or intriguing as it is now . 
tried this place today and ordered the duck bbq pork and chicken for take out . this place is definitely a take out place , no room to eat . the duck was good but did not have much meat on it . i did like the flavor of it but felt i got very little meat . the bbq pork could use more flavor , i ' ve had better else where . i ordered the chicken for a friend and asked her what she thought of it . she made the comment that the chicken did not have very much meat and was alot of bone . i think siu kee is okay but i ' m searching for something better . 
no joking , no harm with words but last night N N N first time at restaurant . now prior to going i asked my son who lives in the area has he ever visit this restaurant , he replied yes , but food is so so , mom do not buy too much or go to another restaurant . i think he was being nice , he should have told me i was not going to like it . i made a N . N purchase , wanted to try a little bit of this and that . everything , except for the candied yams i have a complaint . i truly do not know the folks who write on these blogs - either family and staff and or folks who grew up on eating slop . . . the chicken wings not clean ( feathers ) and too much salt , i truly mean too much salt . fish was okay , but not enough for the price and compared to other restaurants in the area - they put two small pieces with a medium piece . i need to come and show them how to make tender beef ribs . the potato salad and collards were just awful . lastly , the coconut cake - part of the slice was missing , and no the cake , at least the frosting not homemade . it was a too sweet can based frosting and they threw coconut on top . i cook and cook very well . and when you cook good southern food , you can tell most of these so-called southern restaurants will not last long or just need to stay at home and feed that slop to their family members who are used to eating it and think it is good . either i caught them on a bad night or mary t , jensen l . and lynn j . are family and friends or never had truly good southern food . . . no way in the world someone would eat the sides ( i purchased mac and cheese - awful , potato salad made with some watered down mayo - awful , i do not know what was going on with the collards - awful ) . . . candied yams were very good . you kept me from eating too much , because i still have most of that slop in the container . . . very disappointed . 
yummo ! ! first time i ' ve ever had falafel , now i know what everyone is raving about-so good ! ! ! no hot sauce next time though . also had this delicious dessert called baklava i think-yum-yum
get the lockhart - it ' s like N dollars a person ( minimum of N people ) and you get every meat on the menu . this way you can try everything and get the full experience . ( it was everything on the menu but it ' s since changed to all meats ) 
very good sushi is hard to come by in our great restaurant town , so i am always relieved when zento does it right . great , fresh fish , prompt service and a byo ! zento is excellent for pre-theater or before a movie as you can usually snag a table without a wait if you go before N N on the weekends . 
one of the best malaysian food joint i know of ) 
what we had antipasti veal parmesan trio of pasta ( beet and goat cheese ravioli , fettuccini with porchetta and mushrooms , penne with tomato and basil ) unfortunately , this meal was a miss for becco . i loved my last meal here in november , but today , this one was just not good . the antipasti was unsatisfying and the fish and octopus included in it were way overcooked . the veal parmesan was good but just nothing extraordinary . finally , the pasta was just bad . the beet and goat cheese ravioli was not appetizing at all . i am a fan of beets and goat cheese so it can ' t be the ingredients themselves . it just was not a good dish . the porcetta in the fettuccini was chewy and just unappealing . the penne was okay but it just couldn ' t save this dish . sorry becco , i think me and you need to take a break . 
my best friend wanted to meet near her job at columbus circle and i was craving mussels . enter three monkeys . three monkeys is a yummy gastro-pub in midtown . . . . . i wasn ' t expecting much since it is on the cusp of a touristy area , but i was pleasantly surprised . the service was great- our server helped us switch out two of the more comfortable bar stools to the tables ( the stools at the tables didn ' t have backrests ) . the moules frites were perfect- very fresh and not too overwhelmingly garlicy- just enough . the best part is the bread that you dip into the buttery sauce . she even brought us extra bread . and we also had the selection of cheeses a bleu , a chevre , and a brie . perfect ! the beer selection is vast and we both had a micro-brewed porter ( i forget what it was called ) . it was N which was more than i expected to spend on a draft beer , but there were cheaper options , i just wasn ' t paying attention . over-all , great choice ! 
i had just left north star bar at around N Npm on a friday , and was looking for somewhere else to end up with a girlfriend of mine . i got word that another friend was at eulogy , and i figured i was in for an adventure . luckily , i found a spot right out front and mosied on over . the bar was pretty full , but not too packed . great atmosphere , perfect lighting , not too loud , and just a little cozy in terms of space . i met up with said friend who , bravely , went out solo and was hitting it off with a few locals . the locals were super friendly and after introductions , i was ready for a drink . eulogy is a great alternative to monks of you are in need of a few great belgians i went with the yeti imperial stoudt . . . . boy was it delicious ( similar to troegs java head but a little nuttier and a little tastier ) . one of my buddies had the stone black ipa , equally as delicious . there is an upstairs if the downstairs area is too crowded , but i didn ' t get a chance to check it out . apparently it ' s just a bunch of tables . . . the bartender here is really a class of his own . he is very personable , and incredibly knowledgeable about the beers he serves here . you can tell him what kind of flavors your in the mood for and he will have a recommendation specific to your taste . really , top-notch . i was overly pleased with my visit here . i will surely return in the near future to try out the noms they have to offer and some new beers . 
wow ! a japanese buritto bar ? how come i didn ' t think of this genious idea ! ? i finally visited hsk yesterday around Npm . i was told the line runs out the door and down the sidewalk , so don ' t go during prime lunch hour . hence , i waited until Npm and was pleased there was no line so i could take my time and read the glorious menu . basically , its like a giant sushi roll . or , is basically like a buritto rolled in a seaweed wrap instead of a flour tortilla ! you can choose a roll or a bowl . you can choose one of their signature rolls with items already decided , or you can make-your-own ! i went al out and desigined my own roll . i got the the tataki salmon ( similar to sushi salmon ) , rolled up with spring mix , sliced cucumber , asparagus , roasted beets , and crispy garlic . i also added the wasabi guacamole , which was freakin delicious . the entire roll was like one huge salmon sushi roll to me , but better ! the beets and asparagus inside were so delicous . i can ' t wait to go back and try the green papaya salad and pickled mango fillings next . also , you can choose a sauce , i got the chimichurri sauce which is like a green pesto basil spread , it was so tasty . i ' m thrilled this place is booming with business , becuase i plan to come here often for a healthy , delicious , and different lunch ! they really need to do a frequent buyer card , or something like that . 
don ' t believe the hype . food is ok . service . . . non existent . . . . . unless you are into that hipster get it yourself type of service . menu is overpriced . the lines to get into this place baffle me . i live in the neighborhood and the patrons that will stand in line to eat here are either masochistic or zagat readers . . . . this place reminds me a bit of the other tourist trap . . . . " serendipity " . there are so many amazing restaurants in the area . . . that to make a trip to eat here is like ordering the fish entree in a steak house . why ? 
the place is super cute . it was nice to just come here and relax with friends . the chef ' s dessert and tea was a good deal at N . you get your choice of drink and a ( rotating ) N-course dessert raspberry mousse cake , black sesame creme brulee , ice cream with berries , and a macaroon and truffle . i wouldn ' t recommend the cold matcha green tea ( N ) - it tastes pretty standard . go for something you ' ve never had before because they have an interesting and extensive selection of tea . 
if you decide to go there , be prepared to eat bad food for high price with poor service . my breakfast experience there ruined my entire day and i ' ve been having a stomachache for the past N hours . claire ' s corner has always been an attractive choice for its large menu , versatile selection , homey atmosphere , and good quality fresh food made from scratch in-house . today i was so deeply disappointed that i will never go there again . the service was horrible . mainly because of their popularity , they became inflexible and rude . cooked food bar was displayed on a shelf under glass . however , they refused to heat it up because it was before lunchtime and i had to stick to breakfast menu . i stuffed myself with gross french toast and dry cake because i was starving and left the restaurant unsatisfied and longing for some real food . despite my begging for the dishes on the food bar , the owner refused to waste N minutes of their time to heat me a plate . meanwhile , they heated potatoes and cooked eggs for other customers . . . i never write restaurant reviews , but i neither was i ever this disappointed with food service . 
best bang for your buck in nyc hands down . ( that and prosperity dumplings , but neither here nor there ) . there is seriously crack in the white sauce , but the flavor in the meat is unbelievable considering its street food . they also give you a generous portion , though you might be tempted to get seconds if this is your first time . get the combo platter , and be gentle with the hot sauce , i ' m korean american and thought i could handle - but no , pride comes before the fall . N for a platter that lets be honest , tastes like heaven after a late night in the city . brought many out of towners here , and crazy - but a lot of them name this spot as their favorite place they ate at . 
this has become a hung-over sunday tradition for us . despite being busy , we ' re always seated quickly , the staff is always friendly and the waiters attentive . the staff also seem to know the menu well and can recommend food based on what you ' re craving . the spinach smoothie is actually really good , try it . pancakes are a little on the dense side , but that ' s an observation , not a complaint . omelettes are quite large and paired with the potatoes and bread , make a pretty big meal . the waffle has a great flavor to it , but it ' s a little too dense for my taste . sandwiches are a great size with a very good combination of sauces and quality ingredients . it really tastes like they ' re prepping it all themselves from scratch in the back and not buying presliced meats like so many other places . mixed drinks are well made , although if you ' re just here for mimosa ' s and bloody mary ' s , there ' s plenty of better places to go . hint you can double park on the right side outfront on sundays since this is where the church crowd gets permission to park . 
i am very impressed with this place . in a land of overpriced restaurants , this was a refreshing treat . good sized portion , very reasonably priced . large selection of items . don ' t let the word colombian dissuade you . there are many dishes that are basic if you are hesitant to try ethnic food . 
heard about this place through restaurant week , and very happy that i did . i think my favorite part about coming here is the pasta- always perfect
very nice brunch lunch spot in olde city . we sat in the outdoor garden in the back . the ambience outdoor is awesome . feels like you are sitting in a secluded tiny city block from the early Ns . i had the shackamaxon sandwich served hot ( roasted turkey , mango , arugula , aioli ) . it was terrific . it also came with a small salad . my wife had the mr waldorf salad which was basically a yogurt parfait ( sans granola ) served in a mixed green salad . both meals were awesome . will definitely be back . 
this place is amazing ! i love it all ! everything is so freshhh ! . . yummy food and great open atmosphere . 
amazing food , friendly service , good vibes . 
i ' m very happy about this concept ! tapas-sized sandwiches , my favorite is the original serrano ham with olive oil . really nice interior , especially given the price point ( lots of seating ) ! the happy hour is cool too , all montaditos are N , and N for estrella ! 
went there after a coworker saw it featured on diners , drive-ins and dives . i dont watch the show , but apparently its pretty rare for a place in the city to be featured , so this was supposed to be a special occasion . we made a reservation for N . N ( which is the latest time that they accept them ) , but showed up by around N . N , at which point our reservation had been given away . no big deal ( they had actually informed us in advance that we had to be there within N minutes to keep the reservation ) - we sat at a high table in the bar area and got started on apps , and were actually seated comfortably within N minutes of getting there . the food bacon peanut brittles - not bad tasting , but nothing special . i felt like i was eating something out of a can . couldnt really get much of the bacon flavor chips and dip - tasted like ruffles out of a bag . the dip was tasty soft pretzels - i ' m not much of a pretzel person , but these tasted ok . cheese dip was pretty solid roasted duck gumbo - this was my main course . had both sausage and duck in it . the sausage was pretty bland ( and lacking in salt ) . the duck was pretty well cooked but also not that flavorable . overall , the whole dish had a good flavor but pretty one dimensional
garces trading company eases my transition from california to philly by supplying two of the things i miss the most my boutique wine shop and my local olive oil shop . i am so thankful for the wine shop at garces , with its thoughtful and affordable selections . the state store nearest where i live is terrible , so i make the trek here whenever i can . i ' m so grateful to jos garces for making arrangements with the pclb to get some decent wines here , and i wish the trend would catch on . it ' s so crazy to live in a town with great byobs but such a poor selection of bs to bring . anyway , the olive oil selection here is fantastic . i love being able to get fresh california olive oil in bulk and to be able to taste it first . i haven ' t yet found out if the bottles are refillable , but i hope so . i didn ' t want to write a review until i actually ate here , which i finally did for the first time a few weeks ago , when we met a friend for dinner . oh man , everything we had was incredible . this might be my favorite garces restaurant to date . i had the lamb pappardelle and a side of leek chard gratin . our server made excellent wine pairing recommendations . i wasn ' t sure that was going to be enough food , but it was just right . we finished with some exquisite desserts and excellent coffee ( garces ' s own blend , locally roasted in new jersey ) . we came early , so it wasn ' t overly crowded , and though it did get somewhat " energetic , " it wasn ' t terribly loud we felt comfortable throughout our meal . i can ' t wait to come back and chow down on some cheese and charcuterie ! it turns out this is a good part of town for meeting people ( proximity to convention center and market east , plus being on opentable makes it convenient to snag a reservation ) , so last weekend we met up with someone and tried brunch here for the first time . again , the food was amazing . i had the uovo pizza , and my partner had the daily special of house-made sausage and polenta . our friend had the hangar steak and eggs and said it was the best steak he had ever eaten . we were so busy saying " mmmmmmmmm " that we barely said anything else for awhile . we also tried their white sangria , which packed quite a punch . we had really excellent service and enjoyed ourselves immensely overall . this place is definitely high on my list as both a place we like to hang out at on our own , as well as a place to meet up with others , where most people can find something they like to eat and drink . cheers ! 
when the night club is close and tummy start talking . its N N am if you live passaic or clifton , you will hear one preson in your group screaming his her lung out for banana king . in passaic is Nhr fast food chain ' s latino ( colombian ) like mcdonal or bk . banana king live up to its word fast service . banana king ' s slogan is the world best shake . and most people would agree with that . cause their shake are nice and smooth . the menu are so many to chose from like empanadas ( chicken , beef , cheese ) , arepas ( its like pancake ) their french fries have cheese , hot dog and sauces ( pink color ) . sandwhich and bbq . the staff are very nice and friendly , and fast . open late Nhr this place after N am on weekend is pack . alot of people hang out there . " last call , i saw lot ppl get hook up there lol " 
brunch time can get busy . food portions are perfect . staff is attentive . at first glance my steak and eggs looks tiny , but as i finished i thought , " i ' m so glad i didn ' t order more food " . 
i have waiting years for a place to open up in our neighborhood outside of farell ' s . i must say the beer selection , happy hour , and new hot beef sandwich are awesome . i met one of the owners a while back , when i forgot my yankees , great guy ! he sat with my brother and i and we chatted about families . great overall welcome . i was there the other day and asked nick the bartender for the owners name as i wanted to write a personal letter to ownership on a job well done . i told him i come here often . with wife and a toddler once a week is often to me ! instead of telling me that it is against policy to do so or anything of that nature which i would have totally understood . . . nick stated that he works there N days per week and has never seen me before . that was his response to me . . . literally insinuated that i was lying . about ever being there before . . i was not impressed by his lack of customer service in his response . i explained why i was asking , he cut me off . i asked him is this how you should treat your customers ? his response was to me was to calm down . i was speaking in a very civil tone . . . instead of diffusing a situation he was stand offish and really didnt care what i was asking him . i went from yay-i am in fan to a-ok . he pretty much turned me off to being a patron there for the short term maybe long term . afterall , a customer only remembers their last visit . he really burned me up ! 
food is terrible , the kitchen staff is obviously very inexperienced which matches the servers . all inexperienced serving horrible food . 
an ok steak
great neighborhood spot
brilliant food ( went for brunch ) and super cute environment - enjoyed the sundeck seating . 
i thought this was the best ramen i ' ve had . we went to ippudo the day before and liked it , but after coming here . . . i gotta give the award to totto . we waited a loooong time ( a little over an hour ) in the freezing rain snow , but let me tell you . . . it ' s worth it . the broth is so delicious , and i really liked the noodles here . i got the spicy ramen , which was excellent , but definitely spicy ! ! we also got the spicy tuna don , which was surprisingly good . only complaint is how small the place is but . . . hole in the walls are the places with the best food . go try ! ! 
have been here quite a few times . except for a couple of outliers ( subpar experiences ) , the place has been consistently good . regular slices are pretty good , but not too special . the squares are a delight . more saucy than cheesy , the crust is a bit on the soft side ( take that over burnt any day ) . whatever the formula , it is working . 
yummy ! pretty much all i have to say is pad thai see yu . . ( hunt me down if i am wrong ) is the most scrumcious food i have ever tasted . i am making myself really hungry and think i might have to go thai tongiht ) 
went to omar ' s today for lunch . found a parking spot right out front . the neighborhood felt safe and i liked being able to see my car from inside the restaurant . the guy behind the counter was friendly and quick to take my order . after thinking about getting a fresh juice i ended up ordering a cuban sandwich and a cappuccino instead . oh good grief - they were both delicious . the cappuccino came while i was waiting for the cuban and it was ridiculously good - topped with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon . tasted like they put something extra in it to make it extra delicious but i ' m not sure what ( evaporated milk maybe ? ) . then the cuban sandwich came . they were premade so it really only took a few minutes . it was crispy and buttery and flavorful to the max . the meat was obviously seasoned for a while before going into the sandwich and the cuts of meat were thin and tender . i ' m not a big meat eater - not a fan ethically and also because i don ' t particularly like the taste - but this was melt in your mouth deliciousness . i ' ll be going back and trying other things - can ' t wait ! 
one of the best dinners i have ever had ! the food was very good ! the wine was phenomenal ! i have a hard time giving this place N stars instead of N b c the dessert was actually the best dessert i ' ve ever enjoyed . the staff was great and very professional . a N star b c some of the dishes we had ( we split a bunch of plates ) were just alright , where others hit the ball out of the park . great place ! 
this is a great place to grab a drink with friends , especially on a nice day when the windows are open and you can sorta feel like you ' re almost outside . there are things i love about it , and things i ' m not too thrilled about . first , the things i love- the open windows the fries ( though a little greasy ) the girl who brings out your food ( very sweet ) their system of serving food the decor and casual atmosphere most of the bartenders are cool and helpful . the things i don ' t love- it ' s been way too crowded lately , which is good for business but bad for me the burgers are ok and the pulled pork is way too greasy ( the bun literally falls apart in your hand ) , i think they could be improved one bartender , not sure if he is still there , is a hipster with a stick up his rectum who literally whined at me and copped an attitude when i accidentally gave him the wrong denomination bill when i was paying- as if i was intentionally trying to get away with something . seriously ? i ' m the type of person who always gives money back when the cashier accidentally gives me too much change back . the insinuation was insulting , and when i called him on it , in an effort to help the young man boy child improve his customer service skills , he copped an attitude and might have even said " whatever " . 
good food and very nice decor
having come from ny and knowing what good pizza is , this place has it all ! the best pizza i ' ve ever eaten here in philly . i can ' t say enough good things about how fresh , hot and tasty the pizza is . just beware of the wait because this place fills up fast and there isn ' t much space . going with a party of N or more can mean N minutes or more before getting a seat . but , it ' s all worth the wait . everything tastes good here . 
the food was good and the service was also good . i would recommend this restaurant . 
this place stinks up my end of red hook with nasty fried seafood and boiled crabs smells . the owners should be fined for not putting in a better exhaust system . the smell is downright offensive sometimes . additionally , it ' s totally overpriced . the food is completely mediocre , and the decor is so cheesy . i can ' t believe people still flock to this place . 
there is a filtered review that does accurately describe the service here . it is bad . long wait for some ok pizza . it is good but not great . gold ole ' local hangout . look elsewhere if you are not " from there " . 
some in our party were hungry ( me ) , and others in our party just wanted something to nibble on with their drinks . marietta did a good job of satisfying us all . i had the soft-shell crab special , which was deliciously salty . my friends loved the quail , and we all enjoyed the smoky pork shoulder rillette thing ( it was called something else on the menu ) . only the fried green tomatoes were a little too deep-fried for our liking . the service was fine , none of the delays or issues reported elsewhere . can ' t wait to come back and have a cocktail or two . a great addition to the neighborhood . 
amazing food with knowledgeable servers . sometimes the wait is long but worth it . the surrounding area is exciting with plenty of art to pass the time . one of the only places i ' ve had sea urchin and didn ' t have to choke it down . though it is still a hit or miss . the music is a tad loud but most likely because of the communal seating . 
i love this place . it ' s only downfall is that it doesn ' t place a time restriction on the tables or they don ' t enforce it . we waited N hours and the last hour of that was spent looking at the table they wanted to seat us at full of cackling ladies getting refills on drinks . the food is really good quality and seems pretty authentic . i love the suckling pig and cuban sandwich . they have unlimited drinks with different spins on mimosas , bellini ' s , margaritas and mojitos which are awesome . the service and restaurant are always top-notch . it usually ends up being about N a person . big ups for cuba ! 
it ' s awesome and cheap , and very lively inside . we split the tom yum koong soup ( perfectly balanced between sweet and spicy ) , the green curry with beef ( outstanding , i wish i could drink the sauce ) and the glass noodles with shrimp ( very good but nothing to go crazy over ) . i will definitely be making the trek over there to try more ! 
this place is just like tokyo ! great atmosphere , food and service ! want to use for dating for sure grilled sea bass was an amazing ! i will definitely going back only for that ! im so happy my friend told me this place ! 
i can ' t speak highly enough of the mood cafe . the guy running the place gave us an outstanding background description of each of the dishes , delighting those of us in the group who were unfamiliar with chaat . his charm also worked magic on the food it was mouthwatering an impeccable explosion of sweet savory . we sampled a few dishes shared it family style . each dish was unique and flavorful . i cherished every bite and look forward to the next time i ' m in town . first stop mood cafe , a delicious destination for locals travelers alike . 
my first visit was with tough customers my parents , who had gotten the word from a waiter elsewhere in the neighborhood and had given it a try . since they had enjoyed their first visit , i joined them the second time around . food was outstanding not a ' just okay ' dish in the bunch . more noticeable , however , was the smart and artful way that the front of house is run . our waiter took cocktail orders immediately , but as he was managing two large parties , another server picked up our table in a seamless fashion . water glasses stayed filled , plates were cleared promptly , courses were never rushed . all of the little things were attended to , and that makes all the difference . another visit last night confirmed the first impression . basso N is a gem . 
we wish caesar can rise again just because " julius the server " is so amazing ! not only is he incredibly attentive , but also made an extra effort to protect his patrons from bar creepers . aside from the great food and drinks , julius is the best part of the establishment . be our bff ? 
we went there last night for my friend birthday diner . we have N big plate of meat for bbq . everyone is so full that can not drink too much after diner in bar . the beef and pork are amazing and delicious , strongly recommend ! you had better reserve the seats in advance , we waited for N minutes . 
delicious ! ! ! amazing food . have been coming here for a while and i love it every time ! 
good soup clam chowder salad lots of feta cheese grape leaves chicken with lots of garlic
this restaurant is suck because this is the first time i order and they deliver the wrong one . and when i call them , they said they going to give the replacement the next time i ' m going to order , do you think youre going to order again if the service is poor . 
this is the staple of vietnamese sandwiches . other have tried to replicate it but it can never be duplicated . i have been going to this place since it was in its original dinky location over N years ago . if you have never had a vietnamese banh mi , this should be the first one you try . 
meh , not so much . food was decent and one note , and the venue felt too big for what it was . definitely not a N . N star bar restaurant . based on the high rating , we came here when in the area and hungry for dinner , as one does . the place is huge , like the space is N bigger than needed for the bar and tables . it makes everyone feel small and a bit awkward , at least it did for us . the service was very nice though , very friendly . appetizer - mac cheese , good but not memorable . didn ' t come with anything to serve it with , not sure how we were supposed to get it out without putting our forks in , which doesn ' t work great for mac cheese . so i ask for a spoon and get a giant spoon , like a cooking spoon for a big pot . thanks . it worked , but yeah , weird . my gnocchi dinner was oddly extremely spicy , not the best texture , in a weirdish tomato sauce . just not good , not horrible just not good . she loved the goat cheese in her grilled cheese , but didn ' t enjoy the soggy bread caused by pickles on the plate soaking into the sandwich . net net , just didn ' t feel like a great place and although the craft beer and cider were good , the food was just okay , so N stars it is . 
i am so obsessed with this place ! ! now when i first moved out of new brunswick after graduating , i was totally bummed to find that the food choices in the area were limited to chinese or cuban portuguese columbian . not that this is a bad thing , but where was my indian or my thai ? that was when my boyfriend and i found the shish kebab house and everything was right again in the world . what a total gem in such a hilarious location . literally it ' s in one of the crappiest of strip malls underneath a porn shop and a billiards hall that i ' m pretty sure is solely used for the purpose of selling drugs . but in all seriousness don ' t let this scare you away ! the food is so worth it ! ! the menu describes the food as afghani , but when we met the owner ( who is the world ' s nicest old man ) he told us he was from pakistan , regardless , everything is amazing . we got an appetizer , two lamb dishes , and a pot of green tea and everything was done to perfection ! however , if you are one who wants to be left alone while eating , then this might not be the place for you . except the owner to come over to your table often . . . and i mean really often , just because he wants to make sure you are having the best food possible , even if that means adding his own sauces to your plate while you ' re in the middle of eating it ( trust him , he knows what he ' s doing ! ) to top off the meal he gave us a free dessert that was some kind of magical mango tapioca , so so delicious . yum yum yum yum if you seriously want some good authentic food that is out of the norm of the plain old chinese or sushi , then come here , and come her fast , and let the magical old owner in his sandals take care of you . i can ' t wait to go back ! ! 
good food and great beer . they ' re always packed for a reason . fish and chips is spot on . devil ' s chicken is interesting and done well . 
i went to a band of skulls the whigs gig at this place about N months ago . i was there by myself but met a nice guy who felt bad about me being myself and invited me to hang out with him and his buddie , so i guess you could say people are chill there . the show was great , it ' s a small venue and the sound wasn ' t the best thing but the place will make you feel in an underground secret society . . . of people with great musical taste of course . the bands where even selling their own merchandise which was awesome . there ' s enough parking and the bar and stage are in different rooms , so they get to have all ages events . overall , it ' s a cool place to see a show . 
i held my sister ' s bridal shower at the cranbury inn . we got a private room behind the bar which was beautiful . the waitresses were courteous and the decor beautiful . the guests were impressed with the menu and loved their food . booking this special day at the cranbury inn helped make the day more memorable for sure . however , i gave it a N stars as a venue because the owner was a real jerk . he was unprofessional and demeaning towards us when we booked the room . he mentioned he has been doing this forever , so maybe it got to his head . . . 
great to go if you ' re looking for a plate of brown . almost everything is " crispy " or " baked to golden brown . " the food is good , not great it ' s the atmosphere that makes the place . not sure it is worth the price , either , but you ' re paying for space and to " be seen " in the hartford dining upscale cruising scene . 
when you arrive at becco you ' re greeted by a sour puss at the door who asks " reaservations " in a nasty tone . when you get through the door she pushes you in your back with the door . then you get to the so-called manager who does not seem to care how poorly you were just treated . the wait staff is just as rude . once you get your bill you can ' t believe you paid for such an awful experience . there are many great restaurants in nyc who cater to the theatre crowd , skip this one . 
supper was recommended by one of our colleagues as being a must-dine italian restaurant - they were right . the menu is extensive - the staff will prepare almost any dish you have in mind and definitely will help you through all of the choices . pasta ' s were cooked perfectly , the chicken milanese was thin and tender , the burrata and tomato was a highlight . wine list is complete and priced fairly - a full bar is always a plus for me . deserts were good but the tiramisu was amazing and the perfect end of a well-paced meal . 
my husband and i went here for my birthday last night and the entire experience was exquisite . the service was friendly , attentive and helpful . the grilled octopus appetizer was out of this world delicious , as was the swiss chard and mushroom raviolini . we shared the chicken dish and the lamb dish , both of which were outstanding . usually we can pick who out-ordered who , but it was impossible at this place . for dessert , try the chocolate brioche pudding or the panna cotta . . . you won ' t be disappointed . atmosphere was lovely , with low lighting and a choice of many different places to sit , and the food was timed perfectly . even though they were pretty busy , it never felt frenetic or rushed . all in all , a perfect dining experience . if you haven ' t been , try it . so glad we discovered it . 
i want to share the most wonderful experience i had in the tavern on jane . some days ago i had a great day at work and feel like having a little celebration for myself . being near the place i decided to stop there and have a good early dinner . best decision i ever made . cozy , intimate quiet and welcoming . mike the bartender made me feel at home as soon as i seated . he has that kind of old fashion service values that are missing nowadays . a true gentleman . attentive to details and basically focused in providing exceptional service . he deserves an standing ovation . if you want to have a great moment and feel pampered and cared and between friends don ' t think twice . the food is excellent . the rest is history . bravo mike ! 
i made reservations for my family last weekend and i was disappointed . i have heard nothing but good things about this place so i had higher expectations . they had N parties going on at one time . . . one was in the back , partitioned off the other was in the restaurant . they diverted people from entering and exiting the restaurant through back hallways so as not to disturb the front party . it was extremely loud and crowded . the wait staff was overwhelmed and confused . in general the food did not measure up to the hype , although the clams casino were delicious and we ended up getting another order . i might give this restaurant another chance at a time i know they won ' t be busy . 
been here a few times for dinner with my elderly parents . love the food and the service . the space is nice but seems a bit cramped if it ' s busy . i ' m not a large fan of bumping elbows with the person on my left . would recommend for a day that would be less crowded for a great experience . latest visit N N
sushi is always fresh and delish ! 
paisano ' s is a great place . i have eaten there many times , the food is always delicious and the service is great . the chicken parm is one of the best i ' ve ever had ! they have really good specials and home made pasta . . and now that it ' s nice out they have a great patio for outdoor dining , which is also lit up very nicely at night ! 
the elbow room is a modern american restaurant . positives food- fantastic ! ! ! i had the mac n cheese and it was to die for the portion was perfect ! i ieft feeling full but not stuffed and it was amazing i would order it again and again . decor- very cute . nice wooden tables and chairs and cute airplanes hanging from the ceiling . staff- very friendly and helpful ! negatives price- its not too bad but they charged N bucks for one fish taco , and it wasnt even expensive fish . that was the only bad thing though and my sister said it was tasty . overall , elbow room is a really great place . you can even sit on the roof and people watch hehe . i would gladly go again ! ! -kim ) 
i have been to this place so many times , i wouldn ' t be able to recall them all . almost all of my friends love it . the choice of pasta dishes is so large that all the other italian places you will visit after will pale in comparison . the portions are generous , fresh , delicious . i always try something new , and am always delighted . favorites include capellini limone , rigatoni padani , and pappardelle funghi . i usually go here for early dinner on a weekday or for lunch . thinking of going to this place on saturday at Npm ? skip it . the one time i went , the service dipped below what was acceptable , we felt rushed , and couldn ' t hear each other scream across the table . love this place otherwise . 
one of my new favorite places ! my friend and i got the N pre-fixed meal . for my appetizer , i got mini tortillas with a seasoned avocado , main course pan seared blue fish , and chocolate mousse for dessert . my friend got the orange cream pie instead . i also got a glass of sangria . everything was so flavorful and delicious . the atmosphere is so cute and cozy for a date , girls night , or place to take out of town guests . 
if you seek a pretentious gastropub with mediocre service and overpriced food and drinks , this is not your place . the servers are friendly and competent , the food is good , and the beer selection is diverse . i ' ve been itching for a neighborhood bar since moving in just above washington a year-and-a-half ago , and i think i ' ve found it . 
N . N stars for this place . to be honest , this is the best chinese hotpot restaurant i found in new york . the location is clean . the owners are very passionate about hotpot and they treat all their customers like friends . their soup is amazing and i could drink that all day . they offer high quality food . i love their fish skin dish . i know what you are thinking -- it sounds weird right ? but trust me , the fish skin is one of the most unique items i have this year ! i ' d give them N stars , only if they change their musics . haha . . . they play loud trance musics there . i just don ' t think it fits the environment . 
even with a name like steven star , it can still be difficult to make a crowded diner posh . i have been to the continental in olde city N times and i ' m over it . it ' s so way over priced and extremely crowded wioth unattentive servers . . the last time i dined there was for lunch about N months ago and there wasn ' t enough room on our tiny table in the " runway " for N people to enjoy drinks . when it was time for tiny portioned appetizers , forget it , i was holding my appetizer plate the whole time . then when asking a couple of times for refills on our wine we asked for our check . which was about N . i don ' t care where i am , that ' s just too much for lunch , even with a little beer and wine . julie , the hostess , was the only saving grace ! ! 
i ate here at this gourmet cheesery , i have never eaten great tasting mac and cheese like this . the jalapeno mac cheese and and the corn bread was fantastic and i give this N star ! ! ! 
shockingly good . when the recent trend in south williamsburg is new pricey restaurants with attitude , bistro petit is friendly , welcoming and delivers an incredible foodie experience . yes , they take reservations , yes . . . . stop at a wine shop and bring a bottle , and some water and any other beverages with you ( they are not in love with the flavor of the tap water , and don ' t serve it ) . there is no corkage fee . we had the strip steak ( that comes with perfect roasted potatoes , bone marrow , and fresh roasted garlic ) . tasty , hot , perfectly cooked . . . better than any steak house in brooklyn . husband had the kimchi bouillabaisse which is the perfect french fish stew , with a little spice of the kimchi . was wonderful , too . both starter courses , were cold , fresh and perfect . we live in the neighborhood . will be back soon . 
this is my new favorite mexican restaurant in nyc . i ' m mexican and from california , so this is saying a lot . the decor is quaint , the food is delicious , and the staff is friendly . their sopes actually give my mom ' s sopes a run for their money . 
if i think thai , it ' s always joya ( or song- bc its the same menu owners ) . i live about N mins away but we prob get there Nx month . amazing thai food , and it ' s cash but sooooo cheap . i have yet to find somewhere in manhattan that can beat its total package
great casual ambience , friendly service and very good food . we had the octopus app to start which was very tasty and cooked well . the primi was the pappardelle with sweet sausage- delicious . we both had the specials for our main . i had the fluke and my wife had the chicken milanese . good sized portions and delicious . prices are also a value with the wine list a true standout . our barolo was N and one of the pricier choices . def a good pick . 
N . N the space is over N square feet in manhattan again in manhattan , , , , , , do you get it if mario batali , lidia bastianich and joe bastianich did not know what they were doing they would probably not get into this venture and mind you this is not some public funding what more can i say . . . . just go and find it out must visit spot and sorry guys i also see some elite yelpers with copper balls in them to go and rate anything less than N stars to this place i feel sad for those low lifes who have no idea what they are witnessing --eataly in short is a pride of new york
i have eaten at vonda ' s for breakfast , lunch , and dinner and the food is always good . the beef brisket is very good and so is the macaroni cheese . the meatballs for a catered meeting at work were just to die for . i ' ve yet to sample any desert from there , but i think it should be as good as the rest of the menu . the place is really bright and clean , the staff is super nice , and i love to go just after Nnoon . everyone whose come while i ' ve been there speaks upon entering and the staff tends to know the regulars by name . it ' s the kind of place that you go to if you want to have a quick brunch meeting and not be too overwhelmed by everything around you . kind of like being in your grandmother ' s house . just a lot of love and good food . i ' d dare to say that you could bring a book or laptop and get some things done if need be . that kind of chill . i ' ve recommended vonda ' s to several people and my new boss who ' s new to the area has raved about vonda ' s . we ' ve used her on two separate occasions to cater our events . the wine selection for our event was awesome . 
this is hands-down the best thai in nj ! i love , love , love this restaurant and the staff . mama is a sweet and amazing cook . you ' ve got to try the pan seared dumplings , mushroom puffs , spring rolls , the peanut dressing on the salad , spicy basil fried rice , crispy chili fish , and the volcano chicken ! this is a family-style restaurant , and you will feel like family when you dine here ! 
the best pizza downtown . no doubt about it . two types of pizza here . old fashioned pizza- thicker crust . very delicious . regular N " pie ( is reading N " as fun as it is typing it ? ? ) - thinner crispy crust . also very delicious . if you are a skinny bitch and or pretending to be , you can order the arugula salad . it is delicious and so is the dressing . 
omigosh . . . . delish ! ! ! ! and totally so resonable . the owner is very sweet and food is yummy . a worth it trip from whatever part of the city you maybe in . so quaint and adorable . loved the place , food and ambiance . 
delicious sushi ! ! i ' m writing this after my first takeout order and am happy to report that the rolls were awesome . i highly recommend the washington square roll ! 
best burger in town . small space but worth the wait . 
i had the tagliolini neri ai frutti di mare or the squid ink pasta , shrimp , calamari , mussels , roasted cherry tomatoes , arugula , pesto in non-italian terms . that ' s a lot of things in the description and that ' s what they deliver ! they give you lots of portions of each , not skimping on anything and the squid ink is used beautifully in the pasta , with sweet cherry tomatoes and the nutty bite of arugula . the staff is also very friendly . one of the waiters talked with me during his down time and he found out that i was visiting , so he helped suggest to me a few gems in new york to go to that most people might not know about . it was definitely a great restaurant to start my stay in new york at . 
restaurant is very crowded at night and doesnt take reservations . better bet is to go for lunch and go a little before N noon to beat the crowd . all food is very good , but hamburgers are the best . 
if the thought of delicious meat , perhaps with some greens , on a delicious roll makes you salivate , then this is the place for you . i ' ve only gotten the brisket here , and that ' s about all i need to get here . the brisket is delicious without being too fatty , and the roll , which is an afterthought in some places , is a full partner here mmmm . 
nothing bad about it , but not great either . decor atmosphere - eh . food - small menu , creative dishes but not really pulling it off . beer selection - quite good and happy hour prices great . overall ok . not worth the trip down there tho . if i lived down there maybe i would give it another shot but probably won ' t be back . 
i ' ve been meaning to check out this small cafe for the last N . N years - i always walked by it but never had a reason to go in . i ' m glad i finally did check it out ! they have fantastic coffee , probably the best i ' ve had in philly . i did have a veggie wrap which was pretty good . the only problem with it was that it totally fell apart while i was eating it . but , hey , it tasted great . 
trendy place . it has its quirky secret film playing downstairs . great for cocktails and brunch . i went twice and would most definitely go back . great crowd too ! 
i have eaten here a few times , but just never got around to the review . . . i like that fact that if i feel like sushi , i can order that , but i can also order all types of other asian cuisine ( i can ' t really make a ' meal ' out of sushi - unless it ' s lunch ) . so far , everything that either i or my dining companions have ordered , have been fantastic . i ' ve been there with a friend for dinner and drinks ( byob - big plus in my book ! ) , my hubby on valentine ' s day , and my mom , when neither of us felt like cooking . as i stated , everything any of us had ordered has been fresh , tasty , and abundant . i ' ve had the sushi ( i ' m a safety girl - usually just order the cali rolls , or tuna rolls ) - the dinners that i ' ve had come with miso soup , which is the usual fare , but very good none-the-less . . . my go-to meal is the four seasons ( shrimp , scallop , chicken , beef in a garlic sauce - oh yum ! ) . the service is very attentive and friendly ( and they ' ll bring out silverware if you ask - although i joke around that they probably make fun of us upon doing so . . . i try to use the chopsticks - i really do ! lol ) . been there over a half dozen times , and will definitely go back in the future when the mood hits me . 
theres nothing bad to say about this place . great food , great staff , and probably the quickest service ever . and toms has been serving us the same food we traveled to manhattan to get N-N years ago . all the other breakfast spots are playing catch-up toms laid down the blueprint . 
being here in us , you may never be able to exceed the said limit as you get some tasty sea food . furthermore , upstate owns this prestige to have city ' s well honored elite here and taste the food served . i came to upstate back in july with some of my mates from office . it was an incredible experience which made me feel highly satisfied . both in terms of taste and liking of place , they excelled so beautifully that they are second to none and i really got impressed to them in such an excessive way out . i would recommend all my mates and other yelpers to come to this place whenever they get a chance to come to new york . this place will always retain its memories in your mind to which forgetting won ' t be enough easy . 
go here for lunch . lunch specials are awesome ! strolled here during a lunch break to check out all the hype . wow , who knew vegetarian chinese could be so good ! i ordered the hot and sour soup which is one of my staple discriminators for a chinese restaurant . not only was it the best i ' ve ever had , it didn ' t leave that " burning goopy grease " feeling or taste in the back of my throat . i woofed down a huge plate of singapore noodles that were perfectly cooked . i was pressed for time to get back to biz but i just couldn ' t stop eating . i can ' t wait to return where i can sit while not on a lunch crunch and really trench in for some good ol ' fashioned " me so stuffed on chinese food " time . 
we girls always find a reason to stuff face . some occasions demand more of a face stuffing than others . we went to hakata ton ton on saturday right after a got engaged . we stuffed our faces extra that night . and everything we ordered was awesome . we got the first three hot pots ( are there more ? ) and they were all soooo soooo good but the best one was the one with intestines in it . yes , you heard right , a steaming pot of intestines with a chewy gooey center . i ' m starting to think zombies have it good ! dishes we got that night monkfish liver ( foie gras of the sea , my first time and it was yums ) , fried rice ( very good ) , tuna avocado salad ( must try ) , foie gras sushi ( must try if you like foie gras ) a plus ? they will add noodles to your hot pot leftovers . we added noodles to two of the three hot pots . . . oh and downed a large bottle of sake between N girls and N dude . the damage ? N a person . not cheap , but the food was memorable and i ' ll definitely go back ! 
good food for late at night between bar hopping . great service and they have these cute swing seats facing the street ! 
super restaurant ! ! ! pour ma premi re venue nyc je n ' ai pas t d u de ce conseil ! tr s bonne cuisine , bien pr par e en libre service . la nourriture se paye au poids et elle est tr s bon march ! le restaurant n ' est pas loin de l ' empire state building lorsqu ' on va visiter ce monument c ' est le meilleur restaurant le plus proche pour se ravitailler dans une ambiance tranquille et jeune . 
first of all , the cart is now located on Nth between walnut and locust . it has not been at Nth and sansom for a while . they also are at the clark park farmer ' s market on saturdays . i love their tacos . they also serve breakfast tacos at the farmer ' s market . their food is fresh tasty and reasonable . 
good place to go eat sushi . their selection is wide and they are fresh . 
new ( jan . N ) , fantastic full scale taqueria and mexican restaurant in fair haven . as authentic as it gets mezcal and taqueria N quality . note to all , this place is all about the food , no liquor license yet . venture away from the burritos , try the chilaquiles , tacos ( de lengua or buche , this latter cut is delicious and hard to find ) , and the vegetarian options too , the produce is super fresh ! you know good things will follow when you are served warm chips with fresh homemade chile salsas to start . clean , simple decor , and friendly service . 
great food , amazing service , small cozy atmosphere . . . my new favorite neighborhood spot . ps try the meatball sliders . 
amazing service , best old fashions i ever had . 
we were in town for a conference and were unimpressed with hartford eats . . . . until we came to the firebox . i had essentially the same meal as anthony p - and the opposite response . the farmer ' s egg was magical , with the slow poached egg having a creamy texture i never new possible . the chocolate cherry dessert layered one interesting component on top of another . the first bite got me the whipped cream and the salted , roasted nuts the second added the chocolate mousse ( sweet , but not too sweet ) . finally my spoon dug deep into the mason jar to add the delicious cherry compote at the bottom . in between those two courses , the lamb ravioli was scrumptious , although in comparison to the other dishes it a bit less extraordinary . the wait staff was incredibly attentive and friendly and the atmosphere created a perfect setting for a divine meal . 
hands down the best cocktails in the upper valley ! they shake it up so that there is a fine layer of foam and ice crystals floating on the top . ah , makes me feel like i ' m in a " city " again . the food is pretty good too ( though the entrees tend to be on the small side , which is probably the size we ' re supposed to be eating anyway ) . sometimes they run out of their specials by N Npm and the place is surprisingly full on weekday evenings . oh , and you won ' t be disappointed by their garlic fries ! ! 
bbq was tasty , but the service wasn ' t so great . we ordered pulled pork and ribs which were both delicious ( and covered by our groupon ) , and enjoyed the sides ( sweet potato fries , onion rings , mac and cheese , and spinach ) . sauces were a bonus and made it even more flavorful . the bad . . . the restaurant was not full , yet waitresses seemed to be running in circles while checking on their tables taking orders . it was fine , even though at the end we waited for at least N min for our bill to come back after giving a credit card . i ' m not sure why they were so frazzled and unorganized . . . . someone needs to step up and come up with a better plan . 
went here for dinner . food was awful . had better food from chef-boy-ardee . service was awful . will not return nor reccomend . 
the food is excellent . the chef isn ' t timid about experimenting with different ideas , and i love it . the buffalo calamari is light and fluffy , not heavy , chewy or greasy . and the sauce is spicy but sweet . i ordered the bacon , ranch , chicken pizza , it was phenomenal . and we ordered lobster mashed potatoes to split because it sounded awesome . . . and it was . high recommended . 
it was once said that there is no such thing as bad pizza . eba ' s disproved that theory . 
i tried the lamb meatball with mushroom sauce and the pork with regular tomato sauce . both were excellent . 
i loved the thousand layer bread , crispy taro root , asian tea leaf salad and chicken w pickled cabbage . the rangoon house salad was fresh , but the dressing didn ' t seem to fit . the tofu green curry and sauteed fresh mushrooms were well cooked , but otherwise unremarkable . i don ' t know exactly what distinguishes burmese cuisine from its other southeast asian counterparts , but the menu carried alot of dishes popular at thai restaurants . based on what my party ordered , i would recommend going to a thai place for a thai dish . the service at the restaurant was prompt and friendly . some people may find it tacky , but i really appreciate that they left us a pitcher of water . 
go go go ! ! ! foodgasm alert ! i came here for lunch and split the sheep ' s milk ricotta with sea salt and herbs with my dining partner ( felicia c ) . it was rich in texture , but not heavy in flavor . it was a super light and the olive oil and herbs really went nicely with the ricotta . the more filling part of the dish was the bread - but if you run out , they also nicely bring more bread for free . go go go ! ! ! foodgasm alert ! i had the sea scallops with pesto and they were honestly freaking amazing . buttery , perfectly cooked , and a decent portion size for a lunch entree , i ' d definitely recommend this dish . i had a large bite of felicia ' s stuffed mountain trout with castelluccio lentils and pancetta , and i can attest that it was the best cooked fish that i have ever had in my life . the lentils were cooked just right - not too soggy , not too firm . go go go ! ! ! foodgasm alert ! definitely hit this place up for a semi-expensive lunch . i ' ve heard that their breakfasts brunches are great too , but i haven ' t been here for those . . . yet . go go go ! ! ! foodgasm alert ! 
my reuben looked amazing - buttered slices of thick grilled bread , sauerkraut swiss sticking out of the corners . . . brand x turkey . ugh . i ' ve started to find more more restaurants serving this gelatinous , super processed shite . my feeling is a place that can ' t afford real cold cut turkey ( e . g . , boar ' s head , applegate farms ) should just not offer turkey on their menu . portions prices are good . i would consider going back to try their breakfast dishes . 
while the food was average ( i had the mac and cheese with pulled pork ) , the waitress here was incredibly hospitable and friendly . not much else to say . 
sorry to say , though the ambiance has been improved , not much else has remained the same . i had not been to becco in several years . a recent evening excursion in the neighborhood inspired me to check it out again . the good---the antipasto and caesar salad , the cheery room and the interesting N bottle list are terrific . the bad a clueless waiter who disappeared rapidly after being told we had a time line ( before the dining room filled with evening rush patrons ) , a N minute wait for the bottle of wine we ordered ( it arrived after our appetizer was half finished ) , tasteless ! ! ! , overcooked entrees . needless to say , once our food arrived , we never saw the waiter again , and had to flag him down so that we were on time for our meeting . the final straw the bill . it itemized our order correctly , but was accompanied by a credit slip for N more than the itemized receipt followed by open tip line . sadly , becco seems to be on the slide and has joined the fray for the tourist dollar . not so good when real new yorkers are among the throng . i won ' t be back---especially since i am italian , and cook the menu offerings better with similar presentation and flavor . beware ! 
great food and a very nice atmosphere . the salad boat was amazing and the food was great . the lite fare menu was a great option for my wife . also , there is a N off coupon in most nearby hotels . 
i liked it the food is very good prices are good and my wife loves there filet mignon better than most of the steak houses we have been in . also has outside dinning on the patio which my daughter who is N loves to run around . great spot . 
love this place . i go here all of the time . two things N . great happy hour specials for both drinks and food ! N . get the betty burger . just do it . 
right next to the apollo theater . . . amy ruth ' s feels like real authentic soul food ! chicken waffles , kool-aid , candied yams , collared greens ( is that what they ' re called ? ) and fried fish . . oh of course , with a side of cornbread . the place was pretty good . . . but like our soul friend advised , come with an empty stomach - this place is filling ! it was all good . . . a little on the sweet side for my taste , but that ' s the way it goes . . . i hear this is nothing compared to the socal ' s roscoe ' s chicken waffles . 
ate here very recently and enjoyed my meal . my wife and i were able to walk in off the street and get a table for two ( luckily ) within N minutes . . . they really went above and beyond to accommodate us . the food is a bit on the spicey side , which my wife loved . . . i have a bit less tolerance , so wasn ' t as enthused , but if you go in expecting interesting , unique , and food spiced as advertised , you will be happy . we ordered the sampler platter ( had beef , chicken , lamb , and vegetable dishes ) . . . i was expecting to be focused on the lamb , but was pleasantly surprised to find i took to the vegetable dishes . 
we came to this bar to see the final world cup match . the poor service was compounded by a nasty manager . the manager walked around yelling at everyone that if they didn ' t order more drinks he would shut the tv off , a challenging task at a bar with such poor service . the manager told the bouncer to throw out another patron if he didn ' t order another drink . in a neighborhood with plenty of bar options , there no need to subject oneself to rattle n hum . 
where shall i start . . . my boyfriend and i have been here a couple times before and have left beyond satisfied in the past . tonight was just ridiculous to us . we waited about N minutes to be seated which is completely understandable for a friday night . it is byob therefore we did ( a bottle of wine ) , our server seemed to be offended by us having a personal bottle of hard lq and after that everything went downhill . the table next to us were seated after us and he proceeded to take their order before us . he stopped by their table to ask how everything was going , never once stopping by our table . he flew past our table a few times which is also understandable considering the huge crowd that takes over this restaurant almost every night . we finally get his attention to bring the check over and he does the math just throws the check on the table . my boyfriend always whips out his phone to calculate N gratuity , but this guy didn ' t even deserve pocket change . never in my life have i experienced such terrible service . yeah the food is great but there are plenty other restaurants that provide the full package . . great food and great service . 
i came here a few days ago and boy was it a relief ! it was so freezing cold outside that the moment i stepped inside , i knew everything was going to be ok . there was sawdust all over the floor which was a quirky but cool surprise , and the ceiling was covered , and i literally mean covered with christmas lights . apparently the lights are a seasonal change , but it added to the ambiance of molly ' s . all i ordered was a magners and i sat there for two hours happily chatting away with my date . it is such a cozy place that whether you ' re here on a date , trying to catch up with a friend , or eating a meal with your family , you will feel so comfortable simply because everyone here is so relaxed and happy looking . will i be back ? N yes ! 
somehow i was in this place almost every week during the summer of N this year i haven ' t gone there once . go figure . in N , i did really like the food there , but now that i think back i can ' t remember what was so exciting about it . i know i was always ordering goat cheese salads and the like . one distinctive thing for me personally about diner is that it ' s the place where i ate the burger which stopped me being a vegetarian . i think they use organic meat or something fancy -- anyway , it was delicious , and i hadn ' t been feeling well , and i swear that burger fixed me up . 
why have i never been here before ? ! it is only N minutes away from my house ! after moving to my apartment in the bronx for school , my roommate told me about his favorite pizzeria in brooklyn , l b ( note my friend is from long island ) . he mentions how he would take the effort to drive an hour just to get a sicilian slice from l b because it is that good ! so i said , ok let ' s find out where l b is and i ' m going to check it out . it was perfect timing because my dad requested to go to an italian restaurant for his birthday . so we went to l b and ordered a large pie along with calamari and and some pasta . wow was it good . i don ' t know if my friend had overhyped it , but i definitely could not find any flaw with the pizza . we had some sort of egg with white wine shrimp pasta , and that was cooked perfectly ! left here with my buttons popped , but i don ' t care because it was worth the walk of shame ! 
the first taste of scrippelle soup overwhelmed me with great emotion . you see , six years ago , my mother passed away . as you might imagine , it was quite possibly the darkest time in my life . to boot , my nonna also moved back to abruzzo . she lived with us and helped to raise me . i felt like i lost two parents in the same year . for the purpose of this review , i will simply state that i ' m destined to never again eat as well as i did in my youth -- but please recognize that , in reality , this is among the more trivial of my concerns . so , here i was , sitting in this adorable trattoria , not far from where i grew up , excited by the promise of the typical fare from days gone by arosticini , scippelle , arancini , maccheroncini alla chitarra , and so on . le virtu did not disappoint on any front . i thoroughly enjoyed everything i sampled and found it all to be completely authentic , from the complimentary fried dough to the montepulciano to the chef barking orders in italian . however , nothing could ever top that initial spoonful of soup and the memories it brought with it . the scrippelle soup tasted exactly like nonna used to make . as absurd as it may sound to you , it was a connection to my abruzzese family and , in that one fleeting instant , everything felt like it was back to normal again . 
what can i say about mercato ? ! to make it short and sweet it is definitely the best italian byob in philly . i have dined at mercato a few times over the past few years and the risotto always gets me . i have had the pan seared diver scallops ( wild mushroom english pea risotto , parmesan crisp , truffle oil ) and also a seafood risotto special . i actually thought the scallop risotto was better , i think the chef got a little heavy handed with the seafood risotto that i had about a month ago . the cheese plates are wonderful , the other apps i have had were also great and generous portion sizes . mercato has huge windows that are opened up in warmer weather so even if you can ' t score one of their many outdoor tables , you will feel like you are sitting outside with the open feel of this intimate byob . the servers are extremely attentive , always refilling waters . my most recent experience at mercato was for a friend ' s birthday . some of the members of our party was late , and they let us sit at the table for at least N minutes just drinking our wine waiting while we waited for everyone else to show up . it was refreshing since so many places won ' t seat you without the entire party present ! 
i love this place ! being a huge seafood fan , i ' m extremely critical seafood restaurants . fish far exceeded all my expectations . my gf and her friends raved about this place for months before i decided to give it a try . i was far from disappointed . staff amazing . the hostess was great . we came here on a saturday night so there was a N-N min wait for a table for N but the hostess came out every few minutes or so to check on us and give us updates on how much longer the wait would be . our waitress was this amazingly friendly blonde . i didn ' t catch her name but she was one of the best waitresses i ' ve ever had . she did everything right . she checked up on us at the right times , knew the menu inside and out and had a smile on the whole time . she never hesitated to grab anything we needed and was so speedy with our drinks . i couldn ' t have asked for better service . ambiance dimly lit and packed tightly , this place isn ' t for people who don ' t enjoy crammed spaces . the people seated directly to our left and right had to stand up and move their chairs just for us to get into our seats . i don ' t mind the elbow to elbow eating but some people might . even though we were all stacked on top of one another , it never felt suffocating and the conversations never flooded from other tables . food i didn ' t get to try the oysters but their claims were extremely fresh . N for a half dozen clams and a beer wine . it ' s a great combination that i ' d recommend for everyone . our group of N went through almost N dozen clams and oysters . it was pretty awesome . depending on who your waitress is , you can substitute the beer wine for a non alcoholic beverage . i wasn ' t a fan of their civeche but that ' s because it didn ' t have any calamari . my own fault for not reading the menu properly and assuming . onto their lobster . for my first entree i had the quarter pound lobster with fries and steamed clams . it was amazing . the lobster was so fresh and didn ' t have any lingering seafood odor or taste . for my second entree , ( yes i was that hungry ) , i had the pound of crab legs with two sides . the cream of spinach and whipped potatoes were passable . nothing special here . can ' t really mess those sides up . the crab legs were huge . they definitely don ' t skimp on the crab legs like some places and the best part . . . they come precut for easy peeling and eating . prices for a popular seafood spot in nyc , the prices were pretty reasonable . for a group of N that feasted on a bunch of oysters , clams , lobsters and crabs , we ended up getting a bill for N before tip . the better entrees will run you around N- N which i feel like is extremely fair for the amount of food you receive here . all in all , this is one of the best seafood spots in the city if you want great food and great service at an amazingly low price . 
note before i even start i want to forewarn you that this restaurant only takes cash . we were not prepared for that and were embarrassed as we scraped up enough bills and change to pay for our meal . we ' d heard good things about tartine and loved the fact that it was byob . the hostess was nice enough to recommend two nearby liquor stores and remembered us when we returned despite the line that had formed and seated us immediately . we loved the atmosphere and generally had a great evening . however , the food was disappointing . the evening started out on a high note with one of the special appetizers goat cheese and prosciutto stuffed figs . delicious . but N minutes after we ordered the waitress returned to inform me that they had run out of the entree i ordered . between the two of us we ended up with a special codfish dish and the steak au poivre , and frankly , neither had any flavor . the steak was a small cut of meat not particularly flavorful nor well seasoned . the codfish and accompanying vegetables had no flavor . we moved on to dessert and after a few bites , decided we weren ' t impressed with that either . the best things of the night were the appetizer and bread and butter ( we both remarked at how outstanding the butter was ) ! service was mediocre , food was mediocre , but the atmosphere was so enjoyable ( packed on a tuesday night ) , that we ' d probably go back for an appetizer or try it for brunch . 
i visited this establishment last thursday and it was wonderful ! their french-fries are yummy and the service is friendly ) 
love love love ! the staffs are friendly , and generous ! they are real , non of that bs . its really cozy and plus byob ! bring cash , they dont take credit card . also , they have karaoke . their noodle , fried pig feet , and spring rolls are bomb ! 
i too was shocked that a place like this existed in midtown east . heaven . i only wish i had known this when i was dating the eighth-year at wachtell-- i cannot tell you how many starbucks in the area i ' ve had to sit around at waiting for him ! ( all with long lines and no free tables . ) well . i came here on a tuesday , around N N pm . this was absolutely a perfect time to come here . i was able to get a seat right at the counter and i spent two hours here ! a friend joined me after a little while , and she got a seat right next to me . conveeeenient . ok so i don ' t know where to start with this review i guess i ' ll just be systematic . ambiance you absolutely cannot beat this ambiance . i felt as if i was in a norman rockwell painting . i have not really experienced a place that exudes this much " vintage " without actually feeling hipster , fake , or just being plain old . coffee and service ( strangely , they cannot be disjoined here ) out . of . this . universe . i got a simple cafe latte ( to start ) and it was utter velvet . one of those things i got sad about finishing . especially since i hadn ' t had coffee in four days ( i am trying to cut back ) . soooo when i did finish , i went for the big guns i ordered a pot of their coffee that is steeped by pouring hot water through a filter of grounds . the barista ( he must have been the owner-- he had an adorable accent ) asked me what i wanted in it ( whole milk and good sugar , please ! ) and made a recommendation on the grounds based on that . i don ' t remember what we ended up picking , but then he brewed it right there at the counter for me . i watched as he gingerly poured hot water over the grounds little by little until the pot was full . he did it with shocking precision and focus . if you just took a guess of what he was doing by looking at his face , you ' d think he was dismantling an atomic bomb , or performing heart surgery . better than coffee i had had in france . yes you heard me . extra bonus he knew that i had been cutting back on coffee and that today was kind of a coffee splurge for me , he took out this crazy liquid from the fridge made from the coffee berries ( not the beans ) and gave me a little taste . i once had an arabic prof from syria who tried to explain to me what green coffee was , and that it wasn ' t available in america . judging what i had here , i think this might have been it . it was highly caffeinated and highly delicious . it hits your bloodstream , and you can feel it . wow . you know what else i loved ? they didn ' t even have to ask me if i wanted ice water . they just did it . ok , i ' m done . i can go on all day . don ' t miss it . and don ' t go to starbucks ! ! ! ! 
the wait is long for brunch . be prepared for that , especially for cold days because there isn ' t a lot of standing room available . this place is not good for massive groups , just due to its sheer size . there was a group waiting that had N people and i felt bad for the restaurant to try and accommodate them . the owner knows what she ' s doing , for sure . no nonsense , attentive , straight forward and keeps the pace up . the food was delicious ! we had the challah french toast stuffed with pumpkin and the baked eggs over hot and sweet italian sausage . yum . phenomenal . service was good , especially considering the volume of people that were there . we got a cinnamon roll to go and my boyfriend said that even a few days later , heated up , it was delicious . 
it ' s a glorified mcdonalds . the service is the same but the burger , well it ' s alot more satisfying . now if they could add fries , that would be perfect . 
super pumped to give this awesome place its Nth review ! i had been meaning to go for ages and last night was the perfect chance before an early movie nearby . tuesday night at N N - you ' d think it ' d be empty , right ? wrong . woorjip is , as explained by many yelpers , a special breed of place it ' s a hybrid cafeteria-restaurant . you enter and take a plastic tray and utensils , and join the ever-growing line of customers snaking past the end of the buffet . don ' t make the same mistake i did , and fill up most of your plate with food before you hit the " hot food " section of the buffet . not that the first half ( cold foods ) isn ' t fantastic - it ' s just that there are so many options ! little rice balls with tofu wrappings , vegetable bibimbap , kimchi noodles , kimchi rice , just plain kimchi ( ! ! ) , vegetable pancakes . . . i couldn ' t have sampled everything had i tried . and the hot foods include but aren ' t limited to spicy chicken , pork and vegetables , shrimp dishes , more kimchi . . . i wish i could say i tried all of the things i ' ve listed here , but the sad truth is that even this girl didn ' t have a big enough stomach for everything . don ' t let the choices overwhelm you . load your plate up , and then make sure to swing by the deli case against the wall where there are little to-go containers of things like seaweed salad and pickled radish . i highly recommend the latter , as it it will balance out the kimchi fire in your mouth ( if you are like me and get way too much kimchi ) . there are plenty of cold drinks to choose from in the deli case , and then some alcoholic beverages behind the register as well . N . N for a little bottle of barefoot merlot ? absolutely . ( i may or may not have snuck it into the movie with me ) . join the crowd and sit at a communal table with your tray and your twelve kimchi products . you won ' t be sorry . if i lived or worked in the area , i ' d be at woorjip constantly . it ' s cheap , too ! N . N a pound , which worked out to N for a big plate of food for me . 
this place was extremely awful . totally over priced for each personal size pizza that resembles a cracker , got N pieces of fried calamari , the mozarella and carroza was totally boxed and was a mozarella stick shaped as a triangle . the pizza crust was burnt . the sausage was lousy , and the nutella pizza looked like a cookie ! i would be totally mortified sending food like this to someone if this was my restaurant . i ' m now ordering another dinner from somewhere else the same night because this was terrible and we are starving ! 
ok i wanted to give N stars for the place cause every thing is great in there when i go early , but one night i went late with my bf to eat and the bouncer said N to N min it was around Nam we were fine and we waited in line until this N girls came after us and one of them showed her boobs to the bouncer and sure he let her in and left us waiting at the door , so we just left we didn ' t even wait we end up eating somewhere else , and cafeteria went from getting N stars , to one star . manager advice your workers and give them direction not to do such a thing , it ' s rude and so disrespectful
i would have given this review N stars if that was possible . on friday february N , N , the owner of this place went on ray dunaway ' s morning talk show on wtic N to tout his restaurant . after hearing the owner say how great this place was , and being italian cuisine afficionados , my husband and i decided to try it for dinner , since it is just down the street from where we live . when we got there , other folks had obviously heard the radio spot , because the place was getting crowded . nonetheless , they had only one waitress on duty for the entire dining room , and she was a trainee , who was completely overwhelmed . the hostess explained " we aren ' t usually this busy on a friday night . " really ? how can the owner of a restaurant go on the radio to tell everyone how wonderful his place his , then not be prepared for the onslaught of people who heard the spot ? i mean , that ' s the whole point of advertising---to get people to come to your place , right ? we should have left right then , but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt , which ended up being a huge mistake . the hostess ( not the trainee ) ended out taking our drink order and the drinks arrived with silverware and bread shortly thereafter . then we sat there with no menus for another N minutes . finally the trainee brought menus to us , then , N minutes later , never reappeared at our table to take our order . i observed the same thing happening at several other tables . the woman next to us got the wrong drink delievered to her twice . the couple behind us never received menus after they were there at least N minutes . the couple across from us had their appetizer of clams casino delievered to them , but never received any silverware with which to eat it . after N minutes when the clams casino were cold , the gentleman complained and was given more lame excuses by the hostess . when he asked to see the manager or owner , he was told that those people were not present . again , how can you go on the radio to promote your restaurant and then not be there that night to make sure everything goes perfectly ? finally , my husband had to physically go search for the trainee to request the tab for the drinks we had consumed . she said she would bring it right over . we never saw her again . N minutes later we threw some money on the table and left the building in disgust . two other couples were waiting at the hostess station wondering aloud where the hostess was , and i told them that if they planned to eat that night , they should turn around and leave right now . i just cannot believe that someone would promote his business on the radio and then be unprepared for the extra business . very unprofessional and disappointing . we will obviously not be back and anyone i know will be told not to go there either . 
great brunch very popular spot , we were lucky to sit outside and soak up the sun . tasty huevos with coffee and a bloody mary for N . . . can ' t complain ! definitely will be back again to try more tasty food , have been here previously for cocktails which have a nice kick to them . 
i went here for lunch on labor day . the food was fantastic as was the service ! we started off with the tuna tartare , which was in a delicious sauce . next , since we were not that hungry , we shared sea bass special . the fish was cooked to perfection and the kitchen split it for us ahead of time . we finished off with a trio of sorbets which all had unique flavors-strawberry , lime , and mint chocolate . i ' d highly recommend . 
we were surprised to stumble into this gem just by chance . great food at decent prices , and the service was superb . the waitress helped us convert a steak special to be more like the steak dish on the menu , since the special was somehow larger but also cheaper ? weird circumstance but we appreciated the assistance and ended up with leftovers to take home . though there was ample seating when we strolled in around N N on a friday night , the place was getting busy by the time we left about an hour later , so you may have a wait if you are seeking to sit in primetime . two big flavorful entrees , two tasty sides and two drinks came to just under N . worth it . 
i am with dave s on this . it doesn ' t claim to be traditional japanese , but it just doesn ' t work for me does ingenuity really have to be so unnecessarily complex coated in spices and stuffed with cheese ? i left feeling a bit nauseous from an overwhelming mix of flavors . . . ( and , christ on a bike ! with all the extraneous crap going on with the food , it ' d be nice to get a clean cool glass o ' sake ! the plainest thing i could manage was a glass of sake trying to be gin . . . kinda sweet gin , at that ) . back to the food . i did manage to get a plain tuna roll ( they offer a couple others too ) , but i am a nigiri girl , because choice is a beautiful thing , but the only option offered is a combo plate , which is ( surprise ! ) full of seasoned fish . you can order a la carte , but you ' d have to parse the menu yourself to figure out all of the fish they offer . and considering the menu is laid out in painful puns and long winded tales , it ain ' t worth it . also , they pickle the ginger themselves and it ' s too sweet . . . tastes like ginger beer . that being said , the roll with squid , ume shiso was tasty , tho the coating of bonito was kind of overpowering . also , it ' s really expensive , except the plain fish veg rolls , which were ok . oh and the service was kind of lacksadaisical . . . there seemed to be a lot of servers , though they didn ' t seem to notice me . granted , i sat at the bar but the fish is above eye-level , so i couldn ' t see communicate with the sushi chefs . it ' s more common at sushi restaurants here in new haven to be waited on by a server even when at the sushi bar , but the servers at miya didn ' t seem to know that . the owner ' s mom ( i ' m assuming ) was the only one to pay me any mind . 
what can i say that hasn ' t already been written ? it takes time to forget how long i have to wait for these delicious pies but the first bite answers why i do it again . let me also add a mea culpa to the person who walked out to feed the meter while i grabbed his pie . in my defense i was really hungry . i ran to my car and polished the pie off in a matter of minutes with a friend . please tell me where i can find the asbestos gloves , which look so lifelike , that dom uses ! 
this has been my fourth time at zafra ' s . the first time , two years ago was a good experience and since then i definitely have seen progression with both food and beverage . even though it will continue to be my goto place for rum , and is definitely one of the best nacho ' s i ' ve ever had i can not eat the cubano sandwich it did not agree with me . i assume because of all the fat in the pork , cheese , buttered bread in it . no bueno ! its a very comfortable atmosphere ! last time we had a great experience with the bartender who walked us through an amazing rum flight . you should definitely do this ! ! 
this was my second visit to sang kee . the first visit was with a large group ( N people ) we split a bunch of different dishes . the peking duck was by far my favorite . the black pepper noodle dish i found to be surprisingly good . i thought the pepper would be too much but it was nicely balanced . beware it does pack a little punch though . the people i was with ordered it thinking it would not be spicy . the beef egg noodle soup was large enough to share with all six of us ( they gave us smaller bowls to spilt it up ) . the beef was nice and tender . the steamed veggie dumplings were standard dumplings . nothing too impressive . the lemongrass chicken wasn ' t too lemongrassy as some could be . i hate when my food tastes like pinesol . ick . lastly , we had snow pea leaves in garlic sauce . these were up there with the pecking duck ! they were surprisingly delicious ! tonight , it was just me and another person . we decided to split the half order of the peking duck . it was nice and tender , falling apart to touch . the skin was perfectly crisp . the bread was flat like a tortilla . i know some places use puffer bread . i ' m intrigued to try that ! they gave a nice heaping portion of shallots and sauce . we also split the dan dan noodles . we ordered them extra spicy but they left some to be desired . they were barely spicy at all . the noodles themselves were awesome . they melted in your mouth . but the flavoring of the dan dan noodles was just alright . i would skip them next time . if you are looking for dan dan noodles , you might want to go elsewhere . as for the peking duck , i would like to try other places before venturing back here
i ' ve been twice and both times my order took N minutes to come out . it was a very simple order ( burger , fries ) . did i just have bad luck twice ? 
on my first trip to philly i was worried i ' d be hard pressed to find a decent vegan meal , boy was i wrong ! this place is amazing , awesome beer list , really friendly staff , and a great atmosphere ! i ' ve never had a " vegan bbq pulled pork " sandwich , but it was so amazing . it had that great vinegary bbq flavor you kinda want . , i had it with the fresh mashed and i was so pleased i went back the next day ! so good ! 
i went here because i ' m a fan of the one in glastonbury , and i am hoping that the flaws i found in service are just due to the fact that it ' s new , and just opened . we waited forever for a table on a wednesday night , and sat there for a good N minutes before someone came over to greet us . our server could not identify any of the beers on tap , let alone describe them . the food , however , is definitely up to par . people keep saying it ' s not as good as prime N , but as a patron of both , i find the actual burger at plan b to be far better due to the fact that it ' s all organic , ground daily on the premises , and hand formed . parking is easy since it ' s in a plaza - we almost drove by it . i think it ' s just so new and not well established , so people are expecting something that it takes time to develop . however , i do hope that the next time we try the milford location they ' ve gotten their act together , but even if they haven ' t , my husband loves the burgers so much that i might not have a choice . 
unbelievably good even at N N p . m . wait staff was knowledgeable , helpful , yet so unobtrusive . will always go there when back in nyc . 
this restaraunt is really three in one - hibachi , sushi and chinese . i have eaten at all three area now . hibachi not much variety at the hibachi but the show is very entertaining . i actually went back a week after my first time again with some other people . i can ' t imagine going very often to it however . for the sushi , i would say it is about average . for the area it is ok , i actually have not found a sushi place i am really impressed with in the passaic valey area . the chinese resteraunt is a good one to actually sit and eat at ( most others are only good for takeout ) . food is pretty good , interieor is nice as well . 
the food is ok our waitress , christy , was pretty good . . . however , when i received an iced tea with a used half half packet container in it , i lost my appetite . the girl at the register rang us up with a mouth full of food and grease stains on her shirt . it ' s nice to see this diner up and running , but it needs a bit of help . i ' m definitely not impressed . 
absolutely delicious ! one of the owners , sal , is super friendly , and all the waiters are very attentive . i had the chicken shish kabob and it was perfectly cooked . the baklava was also great for dessert . definitely worth a try ! 
i recently went to amalfis for the first time for my cousins engagement party . the food was amazing and the place itself is gorgeous . after the party was over we went into the bar area . one of the bar tenders , terri , was extremely rude and unfriendly . i had mentioned something to my cousin , who goes to amalfis often and her response was " she ' s always like that . " . . i went back a few more times and her attitude was always the same . although , there was another bar tender , johnny , who was very sweet and kind . . it made up for her attitude . i recently found out she was let go from amalfis . . and i think this was a good decision , for the restaurante . everyone else who works there is friendly , nice and they all have great personalities . . . they made you feel like family . i recommend this place to anyone , i drive N mins just to go there ! great food , great people . N stars ! 
always my first choice when im looking for a quality quick cheap meal . the staff is very nice and everything on the menu is great . its a fun restaurant to go with friends . i mean where else can you have a dinner for N for about N-N . always crowded , and a bit noisy but hey its still worth every penny . 
discovering zavino has been one of the best things that has ever happened in my life . the entirety of the restaurant is amazing - location , atmosphere , staff , wine beer , and most of all , the food ! the must-haves are spaghetti squash , avocado salad , a meat cheese board , and the stache ! ! ! 
this is my typical saturday night haunt if i ' m in town or not working . fantastic selection of local beer ( and inexpensive ! ) , though if it ' s a busy night make sure to get your fill of the good stuff early on - sometimes the good stuff will get kicked early . not that that really makes a difference . i don ' t think i ' ve had a bad beer here to date . always seems to be pretty busy , but never too packed . nobody likes to be a sardine in a can when relaxing on a saturday night . well , at least i don ' t . can ' t say i ' ve had the food , but the menu items always sound delicious . the barkeeps and service really put the finishing touch on this place - friendly people and great service . a tough combo to beat . 
great place for thai food ! my three friends and i went on a saturday night , no waiting time which was great and a great table . i ordered pad thai which actually came pretty fast , the dish was delicious and everybody seemed to be happy with their orders as well ! the only two reasons why i don ' t give it a five is that there wasn ' t as much meat as i would normally have on this dish . . . sorry but i love meat . the service was pretty good too . 
aaaaaahhhmada . this creation of the invincible man of culinary skills is one of the best tapas i ' ve had . it was one of my favorite dining experiences in philly . we ate for hours . some of my favorites are ( i ' m biased toward mainly seafood vegetarian ) crab stuffed peppers , parmesan artichokes , grilled asparagus with truffles , spanish octopus , alcachofas y setas , lamb meatballs ( i don ' t eat lamb but i think my table got N orders of these ) . for drinks , our table went for the the tour of spain , and all loved it . amada is pretty pricey , but hey , an iron chef owns it . 
about a week ago , on a saturday night , i had gone to cuban pete ' s for my boyfriend ' s mom ' s birthday . we were refereed to go by numerous people that we knew . we were also warned to go early because it can get packed . we went about N pm and we were instantly seated . but you need to go early ! the place is byob and we brought come cornonas . we started off with the fried goat cheese balls and chicken empanadas . delicious ! we each ordered a different entree . i had the pollo con mango . to die for ! the dish was served with coconut rice and yam . the flavors complemented eachother beautifully . the atmosphere was incredible . very fun and entertaining . the waiters were a bit hard to understand , but we made do , and the little hats that were apart of their uniforms were cute . i absolutly will go there again . as long as you keep in mind that it ' s a busy place , so the wait may be long , you will have an excellent time . 
after years of living away from nyc , i am finally reunited with the mecca of pizza holiness ! my friend reintroduced me to the city with this little hidden gem and i almost died of food happiness after having the truffle pizza . everything about this pizza was delicious . . . it was a welcome back party in my mouth ! seriously , you have to try this truffle pizza . the restaurant is very cozy , service is good , and it also happens to be right near my office so guess who is gonna be a regular ? ? ! 
beyoglu is a lovely turkish restaurant . the atmosphere is cosy and inviting , and the decor is great -- i ' d like one of the mosaic-top tables for my own apartment . however , that ' s not what keeps one coming back to a restaurant -- luckily , beyoglu offers up delicious food to accompany the pretty packaging . the menu of meze includes tons of great choices -- the falafel , hummus , spinach yogurt , and filo dough stuffed with feta are all wonderful . i ' m also a big fan of the beyoglu salad . in the summer , try to snag one of the sidewalk tables for a nice al fresco meal . beyoglu is a great addition to the neighborhood . 
lot ' s of talk about pedigree here . i ' m not about to go into a trance like an infant hypnotized by some jingling car keys when i hear the name le bec fin or lacroix . if they have chops , they should be able to prove it by kicking out some of the best food and service in south philadelphia . for the most part they do . the service is first class , if a bit intrusive at times . there was a point as we were approaching dessert when we had to turn away the server tonging out bread every five minutes . but they got it right on everything else . the dishes were nicely explained and when served they were announced and it was like getting a surprise . our waiter kept our glasses full and was completely personable and professional . the food was very good , but , while thought out well , left me wishing some things were more simple . a perfect example was the sweet breads which had a lot of strong flavors going on and were overly salty in some parts of the composition . the gastrique was heavenly , though , and probably could ' ve carried the dish only with an extra hand from the asian pear or arugula . the chicken liver mousse was well executed and the homemade pickles were great . i felt they did real justice to dish . the pork belly was a real treat because the meat and fat tasted so clean and pure , but the sweet potatoes felt grainy and pasty to me and i felt the pork could have had a better partner . the monkfish was an attempt at something great and even though it was bland to my taste i saw what the chefs were going for and it excited me . the desserts were the only part of the meal that left me a bit unsatisfied . given the great presentation and imagination of the dinner menu , i had expected some seriously intricate and complex sweets . brownies and ice cream ( frozen " souffle " ) seem uninspired even though they were tasty . i ' m definitely a believer in this restaurant . i think everything is there for them to keep going for a long time . the chefs do posses creative minds and the early success of the restaurant will give them the incentive to keep doing new things and making good meals with quality ingredients . 
so . . . ive tried to write many reviews of this place and its making me feel like yelp is only for the bad reviews . . . i ' m seriously thinking this . anyway , again . . . this place is amazing ! ! ! ! it is my favorite place in the neighborhood to go to ! ! ! for dinner . . . brunch . . . lunch ! ! ! they are just great ! if you all take the time to look under " un recommended reviews " at the bottom of the page , you will see how many people love this place and how the few uncultured and fake people get to have their reviews posted for recommended . . . come on yelp , let us real foodies speak our mind ! ! ! ! 
we had a reservation and our table was ready immediately . the food was fabulous , and the drink list was impressive . what impressed me the most , though , was how the restaurant handled a situation we experienced while dining . the people seated next to us did something unsavory and really impolite , and the hostess or waiter must have noticed my face , because they immediately came over and offered us a second round of drinks on the house . really nice way to make the situation right , even if it wasn ' t their fault . upon leaving , we were greeted by the manager who further apologized . will be returning ! 
ten stone has a decent beer selection and a passable attempt at wings . the back room with the pool table is nice if your companions bore you and you need activities to fill your time until you can make a graceful exit . the servers are always incredibly pleasant . so , ten stone is a nice place , i suppose . i don ' t frequent it much except when its convenient and or i am entertaining people who do not really have high expectations about the bars they frequent ( e . g . dudebros , suburbanites ) . i would advise you to keep it in mind mostly for when other plans fall through . 
cute wine tapas place on the les . if you can reserve the large table on the right hand side at the back of the restaurant , it ' s a nice venue to host a party of N-what we did ! i liked the bookcases behind us which made it feel like we were in some artsy fartsy cafe . had the wine and cheese platters i ' m not much of a snob in either categories so i can ' t tell you if it was out of this world or not . also had some arugula salad and mushroom truffle risotto puffs ( good ! ) . waitress for our table was pretty rude---she took away my friend ' s entree before she had finished it ! N . N stars is a much more accurate rating . . . 
we went in randomly . no reservation . the pork cracklings caught our eye on the menu ( they were out though ) service nice but didn ' t make any attempts to check on us or sell us anything on the menu . the drinks were tasty but th pours were embarrassing . we are quality over quantity but this was ridiculous and also the first time i have ever openly complained about poor pour at a restaurant like this . sophisticated comfort food , quality appetizer selection . pork pot pie was nice . pork chop is bone licking good . we ' d go back but probably not til they sort out their opening kinks . 
great restaurant and amazing variety of dishes . . will be back
my oh my ! after dining with blend on the water , i just had to go out of my way to get a yelp and let the world know what they have been missing ! first and for most , the time and effort this place puts in to making your stay memorable is beyond me . . . . it was my birthday , and they made a special birthday card just for me ! not only that , the food is scrumptious ! so much so i had to tell my server felicia ( whom had awesome recommendations ) to give my compliments to the chef ! and before departure i got the chance to personally thank chef nelson for my meal as he came out to thank me for dining with this fine establishment ! we had the arepas and the corn to start , truly one of a kind appetizers to say the least ! we also had the red snapper which was phenomenal ! the salmon burger exceeded my expectations for a burger ! truly blew me away with the chicken fried rice ! i ' m a big fan of spicy and it had a delicious and perfectly spiced jalape o sauce to compliment the dish ! as if that wasn ' t enough , we had dessert despite how stuffed we were-- the dessert platter is out of this world ! not only that , they got the whole staff to song happy birthday which made me a little teary eyed as i never really celebrated my birthday in the past . it was truly a magical evening ! i can ' t wait to come back . . . thank you felicia and the rest of the staff at blend on the water for the impeccable and very attentive service ! you filled my night with laughter and joy and my family and i really appreciate the energy ! ps . please get a frozen pi a colada soon ! ! ) i love the happy hour special , but the blender at blend is a must ! ) 
great food , excellent service ! ! cannot go wrong great for group of friends , date night , or meet up . . . excellent addition to lower bay ridge ! 
in over twenty five years of eating and drinking in nyc i had the really disappointing experience of being " cut off " for the first time last night at char - and yes , this by the same ringlet haired bartender mentioned by t . k . in his review . as someone who has held two nyc liquor licenses myself i ' m pretty aware of this is supposed to work . and three middle aged people averaging a drink an hour talking quietly amongst themselves does not match any criteria that i can imagine for refusing patrons drink . the bartender is really reserved and lacking completely in personality but that was fine until after three hours of us eating and drinking he announces that " for our own good " he ' s cutting us off . two of us had had three drinks and one of us had one ! it was so lame and while i ' ve enjoyed char on two previous visits i would never go back to this establishment . 
i would seriously consider the pulled pork sandwich and the banana cream pie for my last meal on earth . mouth orgasm . 
don ' t do it ! the worst customer service and food ever . placed in order for pizza and wings , was told N min . N hours later food arrived ice cold . the would not replace it offered me a N . N credit . pathetic excuse for a pizza place . your better off with any other pizzeria . 
i usually go to this restaurant when i visited my father . i love their crab meat dumpling and braised beef tripe lo mein yet the waitress sometime were not so friendly . 
this is where i go for tapas . or whenever i ' m craving amazing food in general . 
our awesome waitress kim took care of our large group . thursdays are happy hour with N off draft beers . i had a yummy german wheat beer . the sliders -- a trio of beef , pulled pork and salmon -- are delicious ! will definitely be back soon . 
i prefer sally ' s and modern . to me this is number N . it is still very good but the reason i write this review is that the franchise are not as good . do not go say to mohegan sun and expect it to be as good as new haven because it is not . it is not consistent as i have had good pizza there one time and not so good the next time . they could not get away with that in new haven as we know our pizza but i guess they can get away with it in eastern ct . 
heaven on earth for hungry people . . . you better have self control or you could be eating cookies , ice cream , and candy for lunch ! everything fresh and priced right . have the basset ice cream- just arm yourself with napkins- you will need them . had thai soup one day , rib dinner the next . so fun to browse and people watch . you gotta go ! ! 
they have definitely captured the french bistro ambiance . it is quite a large space with multiple tables and position to someone else is more than close , yet quaint . the inability to keep the liquor dispensation area from the diners may be an accident or on purpose . i had dinner here a few weeks ago with my father , cousin and his girlfriend . i did make a reservation , which is necessary . we were seated around our initial reservation . it happens that it wasn ' t exact because it is center city . the wine , which was picked by my father , was amazing . it tantalizing the tongue , mind and spirit as it should . the dinners were great and there were no complaints . if you have guests from out of town or just a night out , i recommend parc all the way . 
soooo goood ! ! came here with a group of N to celebrate the hub ' s and another friend ' s birthday and had the bo ssam . it definitely did not disappoint . before getting the bo ssam , we ordered a bunch of dishes and apps to start off with pig head terrine pig ears sardines fried artichokes jonah crab claws and the spicy sausage with rice cakes . my personal favorites were the rice cakes , crab claws and artichokes . everything was delicious and beautifully presented , but a tad on the pricier side for the tiny portions . then the pig came out and it was sooo good . i thought it was weird to have a raw oyster wrapped with the pork , but it had a nice mix of salty and sweet . the kimchee also had a great flavor and it was more sweet than spicy which is why i liked it so much . i , along with everyone else in the party , was in a state of a serious food coma but all agreed it was well worth it . the boo ssam portion was huge and there were still leftovers after we were done . everyone raved about the food and we were all very happy with the meal . well worth the big tab . 
this is a great hole in the wall . . . . don ' t be fooled by its lack-luster decor and front entrance . the magic happens inside the kitchen where you can watch the guy make the noodles right before your eyes . while your soup is being made , i recommend getting an order of dumplings . service is quick and courteous . the menu is easy to understand as well . i made this short video showing the master make his noodles . vimeo . com N
dare i say it ? don ' t go truffle everything . it ' s really overwhelming . just get the fries or the burger , don ' t get both . however , that being said , the original burger was better than both truffle fries and burger . i kept reaching over for my husband ' s burger because i loved the parmesean crisp . i ' m also really impressed with how fast they seated us during lunch , which worked out conveniently since it was birthday ! just like dan t though , father ' s office is still my fav . 
the only reason i didn ' t give the meatball shop N stars was the ridiculous two hour wait , and the no reservations policy ! other than that , . . . the food was delicious , the staff was incredibly sweet , and the ice cream sandwich is to die for ! we each had a slider as well as a meal , the portions aren ' t huge , but filling . i had the special jambalaya meatball and risotto bottom , it was very flavorful , and the meatballs were incredibly tender ! the chicken slider with white sauce was amazing ! i could have easily ate a plate of them ! definitely a great place to try ! 
i was a guest on good morning america a few weeks ago , and this was our first trip to nyc . i had seen minetta tavern on the travel channel , and decided that the cote de boeuf was something that i had to have . it did not disappoint ! i am a seafood wholesaler from charleston sc , and i get to eat in fine dining establishments all the time , due to my job . i felt like a kid at disney world when we walked into minetta , and were greeted to a packed house on a tuesday night . we only had a thirty minute wait , and were seated across from the bar . our waitress did not even get the full words out of her mouth , as soon as i heard " nantucket bay " , i found myself saying yes , as i know that nantucket bay scallops are the best of the best , when it comes to seafood . they are only available for about eight weeks each season , and i was lucky enough to get them here . we decided to get the cote de boeuf for two ( N ) . they tease you with a sizzling , aromatic chunk of beef , and then take it to be sliced . it returns amidst a pile of beautiful marrow bones . we had the waitress take a photo of the plate , and then we proceeded to have a literal food orgy . . . . . steak , marrow , incredible potatoes ( served in a mini dutch oven ) and cheese . the aftermath photo of the carnage is comical . . . . bones , empty plates , smeared tablecloth . . . . . . awesome ! just when we thought we were finished , one of the managers shows up with a chocolate souffle ! we ate the whole thing ! will i go back , absolutely ! was it worth it , yes . did it live up to the hype N . i think anthony bourdain picked a winner . i even mentioned my meal on the gma segment . i had never been to nyc before , and can ' t wait to come back . thank you minetta tavern and nyc for a wonderful experience , i will always have kind words for both of you . . 
went for restaurant week ! this small restaurant in the west village lives up to its reviews . i have allergies and they were very accommodating to me , able to change some dishes slightly in order for me to enjoy appetizer entr e from the prefix menu . the baby romaine salad was perfectly balanced with sweet and salty . i had the hake prepared rye crusted branzino style . both were amazingly delicious . for dessert , a variety of ice creams sorbets . service was great , attentive but not overbearing and never rushing us out the door . would definitely return ! 
went to fairfield location this past weeken and dont understand how this place is still in business ! steak dinner looked as if it was previously frozen and as dry as a bone . other family members had two different types of cobb salads , each looked as if they would not have been up to par at burger king . extremely overpriced and they seem to skimp on everything . if you enjoy paying for soda refills then maybee this is the right place for you ! burger came out like a hockey puck also . potato skins were good and in all due respect it is a nice looking restaurant with flat screen tvs . but definately wouldn ' t go back again and my prediciton is this place wont be in business in a year unless they get there act together . 
i read the reviews of this place and thought i should give it a try ! my friends and i decided to stop here to celebrate our good friends ' bday . i called to reserve for a party of ten , and they set us in a nice lounge area by the window . the food was good ! i loved their ginger wings and dragon fries . they were known for their lychee martini which was good but not worth the N . they played good music , but it wasn ' t a space to dance . there just wasn ' t much room to . nonetheless , i feel that it ' s a cool place to unwind if you don ' t mind spending N-N per drink . i had an overall ok experience , but the bday girl enjoyed herself ! and , that ' s all that matters ! 
what i liked the most about rats is the unique beautiful peaceful setting . each room is beautiful and the outside pond and sculpture peaceful and lovely . i only went there for lunch - the selections were an interesting mix . the food was good not excellent . i was not a fan of the onion soup , the special mushroom soup was much more interesting . the home made pasta was good but not outstanding . that being said - i did enjoy my meal . i found the surroundings special and soothing . have to say , i had tried to make an earlier reservation and they were booked but when we went past at that time it was almost empty . that bothered me a bit . we easily got a table by walking in earlier . i hate the name ! 
i had to look hard to find this place . the front of the restaurant gets lost among the obnoxious signs from the surrounding store fronts . it ' s right across from the library . i ' m so glad i found this place ! there ' s no table service , just order at the counter and take your in a little shot glass and wait for your deliciousness to arrive . i had the grilled cheese with tomato soup . perfection ! they also have fancy coffees which i have yet to try . i ' ll definitely be back . 
this is the perfect place for sunday brunch , i had the eggs florentine and it was quite delectable . the atmosphere is great here , but beware come here before noon so you can skip the lines , otherwise you ' re looking at a N min to N min wait . the moment you walk in , you ' re greeted with a heavenly smell of baked goods , waffles , pastries and the like . they have a variety of seating options , the back is more for couples and it has a garden like feeling . they also play a good selection of jazz . servers are friendly and quite attentive , they constantly checked up on us a few times during our meal . on to the food ! for the price you pay you are getting more than you can eat ! for one order you can probably share it between two people . . i highly recommend their eggs benedict , definitely one of the best i ' ve had in new york . it also comes with a side salad of fresh greens , they tossed it lightly with a sweet vinaigrette . the toast that they place the eggs on was on point with the crunchiness . great atmosphere , great food , great servers , a brunch spot in the heart of flatiron . 
these padrotes ( mexican word for pimp ) keep it mad real . 
just left here and easily giving it N stars . it was our first time and we were a large group ( N adults ) and we had a wonderful time ! our server was attentive , considerate , never rushed us , and made us feel like special guests . assisting staff kept our water glasses filled and our tables clean . the food was mostly great all around . my duck was flavorful but a bit tough , but i know that to bring all the plates out together sometimes they sit under a burner and it could have overcooked . my husband had the rack of lamb and said it was delicious . also a hit the chicken rollatini . we were given complementary bruschetta and small champagne glasses . it was my husbands birthday so i brought a cake . when it was time for it , the cake was lit , then slices were served in decorated individual plates . paying also went smoothly . you can ' t split the bill but he added tip and it came out pretty even for us all . my friends and i enjoyed our experience . i ' m definitely coming back again ! 
had a very nice relaxing evening her at the outside tables . i was dog sitting so i wanted a place i could bring my little friend along , and this was the perfect place . as soon as we arrived the waitress greeted us all happily and brought the pup a water bowl . they have a very extensive wine selection , but the house wines are steal at N a glass . i definitely expected the price point to start higher , but i had the sauv blanc and pinot grigio and enjoyed them both . we didn ' t get food except for dessert , and i definitely want to return to try their dinner menu . the dessert we got , a strawberry shortcake with lemon custard and homemade whipped cream , was amazing and perfect to share , although i definitely could have eaten N on my own . very friendly and attentive service as well , which can often be lagging when you sit outside . 
i go see rocco at least once a week . there is nothing you will ever order that you wont be N happy with . best italian in ny . we love vinny also . always make us feel at home . 
if you ' re looking for a ny N star uppity type restaurant keep looking if you want a down home delicious italian style meal - you won ' t go wrong with this place . the risotto is on par with the top places i have tried in nyc . the lump crab cake appetizer was delicious . the tiramisu was good the tartufo was nice and creamy . the prices are reasonable for the great quality of the food . street parking is a hassle , the waiters are super busy , but the place is always packed , it ' s full of loud people eating , drinking ( byob ) and having fun while enjoying a slice of life with their cappuccinos . come to enjoy and relax , leave full and content . how can you ask for anything better ? 
i love little places like this hidden away in brooklyn ! ! the atmosphere was dim , and somewhat romantic ) the server was patient , and actually spoke italian ! ! it was so wonderful to hear the language among the staff and customers ! ! the food was delicious and just enough . unending bread basket , and a small dish of olives are complimentary . we started off with a gorgonzola and walnut salad , and the black olive gnocchi with red sauce was incredibly savory and smooth . the tiramisu was a bit too rich , but the menu was full of wonderful choices ! ! i would , without a doubt return . come early ( Npm ) it will be crowded by N . 
i really wanted to like this place , but i just cant . . . . went last night and sat at the bar , the bartender was so rude and nasty . . . i never understand this , being that i have been a waitress and bartender i really just dont understand when someone whose job revolves around costumer service can be so rude next . . . woke up this morning still with the taste of over garlicy and salty food . . . not good , not good at all . . . when food is too seasoned , its obviously covering up for lack of taste the only reason this place gets N starts was because the pumpkin croquettes were great . . . but how can a fried ball of cheese not be ? 
have eaten drank here thrice now and enjoyed it each time . burgers , fries and shakes are not my typical favorites but i can ' t really resist at this place . i took some friends there last sunday and everyone was like " bobby , why do you keep mentioning the burgers ? get over it ! " but when they actually bit into their burgers i swear they all said it was the best they ever had . i ' m not exaggerating at all . i was in a fat-girl kinda mood so i had a milkshake with patron in it ( soooo good ) and the grilled cheese which was simply amazing . in short , everyone loved it , and i was so glad to find another place to go for sunday eatin ' . plus its at the piazza which is so cute i can ' t stand it . 
the noodle was good . the environment was . . . well you should know what you are expecting when you go to a chinatown restaurant . cheap eat . 
ok . so the server says hi ( unenthusiastically ) . we sit , she slams the utensils and napkin down on the N ' s style table , we then proceed to order our appetizer , and she tells us that the kitchens closing so we need to order both right away . mind you it ' s Npm , they close at N . her attitude was awful and then clearly starts cursing us out in her asian language . she brings these nasty uncooked dumplings , i couldn ' t eat it , gross , paid for the appetizer and we leave . this place sucks ! 
i have to say i love this place for three reasons only ! food , drinks , and view ! however the overall service is horrible ! if your tolerance is high for that go for it ! 
definitely one of my favorite markets . so many shops compacted in block and there ' s anything from sandwiches to sushi to sweets to meats to seafood . it ' s pretty much endless and they also have fresh produce . you can get almost everything here . it ' s fresh and the foods are cooked on the spot . lots of locals come here and tourists also , you would be missing out if you didn ' t stop by here when visiting philly . they have seating areas around the market so you ' ll have to scout around for that . some of my personal favorites would be - dinic ' s ( delicious roast pork sandwich , get it with provolone and broccoli rab ) , beck ' s cajun cafe ( amazing gator gumbo , full of spice and chunks of gator sausage ) , kamal ' s middle eastern specialties ( stop by for a refreshing lemon na-na , aka mint lemonade with rose water and also the baklava - so good ! ) . a little note - if you can help it , don ' t come on a sunday because a lot of shops are closed . best day would be saturday ! 
i was super excited to try edi the wolf . the ambience is great - dim lighting , interesting decor , communal tables ( but didn ' t feel awkward ) . the wine list is extensive with helpful descriptions , and beers are interesting austrian choices . definitely a fun place to go for a drink . the food menu doesn ' t give a ton of options . they have small plates of tapas , " shared plates " with larger portions , cheese plates and entrees . all sounded unique and interesting . we decided on N of the shared plates - baby back ribs and spaetzle . good choice - baby back ribs - they were well-cooked , tasty and came with N dipping sauces - N good sized ribs . bad choice - spaetzle - this came in a rich creamy cheese sauce that wasn ' t mentioned on the menu . . . i ' m not sure what type of cheese , but it had a very strong , almost sour , smell and flavor that i really did not like . the noodles had a good texture , but the sauce ruined it for me . the entrees that we saw others eating looked good , and the service was excellent . our waitress was helpful , but not pushy , and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming . i ' ll have to give edi the wolf another chance sometime soon . 
best brunch in manhattan- though there can be a wait , every bite is worth it . i recommend the french toast and fried chicken and waffles . 
i really hate to do reviews like this but this a horrible place ! N ) they gave me N shrimp egg rolls instead of spring rolls . i am allergic to shellfish ! N ) the general tso chicken was so funny tasting and slimy i wouldn ' t let my children eat it . N ) my chicken fried rice meat was really undercooked . . a waste of N . . never will eat there again ! 
it ' s all been said , but i ' ll say it again . uncle willie ' s is an amazing find , just off i-N in west haven . the food is delicious . the interior is a combination of menus from other restaurants and various patriotic symbols . the staff are friendly , the place is clean , the price is right , and the sound track during our visit was mostly bb king and jimi hendrix . i was in heaven in uncle willie ' s and i wish they were in my neighborhood . 
i eat here at least once a week for the all-you-can-eat . i love the tiger roll and crunchy eel roll . the eel is as fresh as i ' ve ever had . the salmon is almost the consistency of toro ( fatty tuna ) and is out of this world as well . for less than N per person , you absolutely cannot beat their price either . 
we really enjoyed our dinner last friday night . the food was delicious and service was the best with our head waiter jim m . my wife selected from the N to N course menu ( she only ate N N N portions and i had the other N N N . i chose the ala carte menu starting with tuna sashimi followed by the the marinated pork dish . jim ' s wine recommendation was perfect and reasonably priced . we will be back ! 
made reservatuons , waited close to an hour to get seated and the service was slow . what ' s the point of making reservations ? the food was good but no better than other places with impeccable service . go elsewhere would be my recommendation . 
i went here for brunch today and loved it ! there ' s outdoor and indoor seating and the menu features a decadent and diverse brunch menu . i love the crepe and pancake selection as well as the inexpensive omelette options . i opted for the eggs benedict with the spinach and english muffin option . it was delicious and came with a hearty side salad and home fries . i especially like that they offered spinach as a pork beef alternative since i don ' t eat those meats . they also had turkey bacon . it got even better when they had soy milk for my latte . overall , i would recommend cornerstone . the service , menu options , and atmosphere are all perfect for a tranquil sunday brunch . they also feature a diverse variety of alcoholic beverages such as lots of great beers , sangria , and an alcoholic smoothie that really intrigued me . . . i will definitely order that next time . 
this was my first time at this restaurant and my first time eating peruvian food . i had always driven past it and finally decided to try it out . the flavors were delicious and the waiter was very attentive . it is also very nicely decorated . i ' ll definitely be back ! 
i was genuinely disappointed when i ordered the mekanek and was served a large portion of jimmy dean ' s microwaveable sausages . i had gotten the same meal for a fraction of the price in shop rite ' s frozen section the day before . instead of paying N here , just wait for a buy one get one free coupon for that great jimmy dean ' s taste we all crave . 
i think crowding got the better of them . after visiting them one and two years ago , now you had to wait in line during lunch and dinner on weekdays and in the weekend . ( they cant be all wrong i believe ) . but our burgers where not prepaired with love anymore and not even well done , and also the shape did not match the bun . it looked like an ikea metbal and tasted like tartar . nope , we are not coming back and cannot recommend the corne bistro anymore . . the ( free ! ) burger we got with our drinks at the iron-horse bar was way better
i don ' t know where to begin . this was my Nth time dining here at osteria . i have never had problems here before . so i take my girlfriend out on our N year anniversary . i ' ll be honest , every time i go to osteria i have my car valeted , i wouldn ' t say it ' s the worse neighborhood , but it ' s philadelphia and you never know what would happen . the valet was rude and gave me attitude when i held them up to grab my gift out of my car . i get into the restaurant and to be honest , i don ' t remember it being so dim , but it was a nice ambiance . the staff on the inside was great . the octopus was amazing , as well as the veal . i had the chocolate flan , and to be honest , it wasn ' t quite what i was expecting but my girlfriend loved it . on the way out we waited for my car for N minutes or so , i didn ' t mind since the weather was nice and just to get some fresh air . the valet brought back up my car i noticed a scratch on the passenger side of the car . my car i did not even have N , N miles on it , it was practically brand new . when i asked the valet what happened he basically warded me off and disrespected me . i have never been so insulted in my life . what could have been a great night ended as a disaster . 
my boyfriend and i were foolish children and did not plan our valentine ' s evening . we had no reservation , and it was slightly drizzly outside . bar bruno had opened around the time we were moving into our place in cobble hill . we decided to try it . they did not ask us for a reservation so i don ' t think they take them . the inside was adorable ! the ceiling has those quaint tin ceilings that i love about ny . we say down right before the rush . when i say rush i mean like a tidal wave . within ten minutes the entire place was full . there seemed to be just one waitress and she flew around the place with this huge pretty smile on her face trying to get everyone sorted . i started with the soup of the day , black bean , flavorful , not overly salted , and a nice portion , not too small not too big . we both had bottle beers to drink . for our main course i had the veggie burger ( quinoa ? ) , very good , and he had the mussles with fries . as i don ' t eat seafood i can ' t personally say if it was good , but he really liked it and he slurped on the liquidy leftovers at the bottom of the bowl . we had a giant profiterole for dessert . why the N stars ? you know when you go somewhere and the food is actually good ? like across the board good and not crazy weird ? that ' s this place . the service was warm and as attentive as possible for how busy this place was . it was also cozy , not too loud and accessible . 
just had the skirt steak sandwich for lunch at chambers walk . ambiance was awesome . price was good . steak was delicious ! wait was a little longer than i would have liked , but i assume it was because everything was made fresh when ordered . i will be going back soon . 
i have been here N times . most times , on friday nights . never disappointed . the food is great . the drinks are strong and taste great . i have had the caihpiriniah ( idk if i spelled that correctly lol ) . its a brazilian drink full of fruits , sugar , and alcohol . the steak is great . the music is fun and they often have a band with carnival dancers . 
every time i ' ve been . food has been nothing but amazing . recommend making reservations . 
i ' m in love ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! when my date and i first arrived to the restaurant there was a N min . wait , we placed our names on the list and ventured off just to see what else was around . had our hearts set on room service so we went back . once we went back we were seated . the seats are pretty close to each other so i kinda felt like i was there with more then just N person since i was able to hear their conversations . but the food was awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! i had the calamari entree which was my first time having calamari and i fell in love ( i think it was the red sauce ) and for my main meal i had the chicken thai fried rice and loved it as well . the place is dark and has a sexy feel to it but since people are so close to you , you don ' t get that " were alone " romantic feeling . but the food was perfect
we wanted to try guy fieri ' s new restaurant after watching a show and found out at N Npm , they were closing in N mins . on a friday night ? with people busting at the seams in times square ? with N cruise ships in town and they were closing the restaurant at Npm ? the nearest place was jr ' s - " moan " , " do we have to go eat there " ? i ' m not a fan of their cheesecake and my bff took a nyc tour and the guide told them the cheesecake isn ' t that good . listen to that man , a new yorker , ok ? the cheesecake isn ' t that good . we went to try their dinner , " moan " - i knew i wasn ' t going to like it . hubby had their fried chicken - nice and crispy , very bland , which is better than the " good restaurants " these days who are overly generous with the salt . at least you can salt it as you like . it came with soggy , overcooked vegts , " moan " and fries ( the frozen kind ) . they gave the table comp " cole slaw " which was overly pickled and funny tasting pickles ( as if they ' ve been soaked in gasoline ) . free food usually means dinner is gonna take a long time to make it to you . bff had the beef brisket , mashed potatoes , vegts . she was so hungry , she ate the whole thing but she gave me a bite of the beef - it was dry , bland and " moan " , not good . bff ' s hubby had the meatloaf , which didn ' t look like any meatloaf i ' ve ever made at home . i thought it was a hamburger patty drenched in gravy . came with vegts and mashed potatoes . i tried the buffalo wings appetizer which was not too spicy , soggy crust with blue cheese dip . it was just ok but they are generous with the portions and i couldn ' t finish all the wings ( over N pieces ) . staff service was good , nothing spectacular . most of them look like young ( N ' s ) unemployed actors dancers or local nyers who can only find work in times square waiting and busing tables . 
amazing spot for late night cocktail open everyday to Nam ) one long , moaning orgasmic yes for heavy woods their beer selection is on point and affordable , and their food menu is now probably the best priced in the neighborhood . 
good chips , salsa and guacamole prepared table size . a nice , affordable menu and a nice place , with good service , at least at lunch . 
this place looks like a bodega on the outside ( a damn good one too ) but inside hides delicious food . the place is clean and the employees are always so nice even if there is a language barrier sometimes . its definitely one of the places i frequent now . 
without any doubt the " reading terminal market " presents all different variety of traditional philadelphia food and a reminder of old philadelphia ' s " food market place " . although this is not the first and only food market place in philadelphia but it is very popular . i am a fan of this place and i like it especially the food is great ! this is my personal experience . please share your personal experience that you had with every business at reading terminal market , especially if the person who was serving you or the business owner was not very respectful or was very kind or even the food ' s quality so they can correct and improve their services . 
love this place . . . the only thing that sucks is that i live too far now . when i lived in newark i would go here all the time . just make sure you get there before the church crowd on sunday because you can easily wait for N mins or more . 
came here for the first time yesterday . the N beers on tap is what drew me in , and surprisingly they had some of my favorite craft beers there ! the food was great as well , we had the bruschetta and risotto balls . both were perfectly crunchy and seasoned great . we spoke to the owner and he really cares about feedback and what he can do to make the place better for his patrons . the head bartender ( forgot his name ) was really cool and can tell he has a lot of passion for his craft . it was fun seeing his concoctions and his flair while making them . the interior is also very inviting and has a very nyc feel , just a great place to sit for a while and have some good drinks and italian bar food . all in all , i will definitely be back . they also deliver ! ! just need a N minimum . 
the mac and cheese is to die for ! thas all i can remember abt this place ! simply delish and a must ! forget abt everything and go for the mac and cheese ! sooo freaken good ! the best i ' ve ever had and i dont even care for mac and cheese . damn good ! the place is super casual and very much a beer spot . 
i ' d yet to find a greek place i loved in the city . until someone recommended pylos . i saw they took reservations so figured why not . and oh my , was i happy i gave it a shot . tucked around the corner from the bustling Na , it ' s a nice cozy spot . i loved the decor as we walked in , the ceiling comprised of clay pots . i ' ll admit i was a little worried they might fall off . thankfully not the case ( whew ) . the first time i went , we had the horiatiki salad , which was the classic greek village salad . it was good and fresh . . . but like my salad mixed up a bit more . it was essentially big chunks of fresh tomatoes , onions , cucumbers , olives , and feta cheese , along with some capers and a dressing of olive oil and red wine . it was not quite what we were expecting . on my second visit , we instead tried the maroulosalata . amazing . i may just get that occasionally to go . best salad i ' ve had in a long time . it was basically lettuce , dill , scallions and feta all diced up into small bits drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and fresh lemon dressing . so good . i ' d forego dessert in favor of space for this ( serious business ! ) . the second visit we also tried the saganaki tou merakli , which was basically just three greek cheeses melted in a clay pot . but when has cheese ever really been basic ? it was melted just to the point that the cheese was slightly crispy on the top . ah perfection . i ' d recommend rationing your bread they bring you with their hummus instead to go with the cheese , as the one thing i ' ll say is i really do not like their hummus . it ' s lumpy and lacks flavor . call me a hummus snob . for a main course , the pasticcio wins every time . i just can ' t try something different . i ' m hooked . it ' s like a greek version of a lasagna . if you haven ' t tried it yet , you must . must ! they do not skimp on portion size , for sure , and the good news ? it reheats mighty fine , so order away . this is a great spot for dates , family visits , or any special occasion . 
from the bread basket to the dessert and everything in between we enjoyed ourselves . the space is open and airy with huge windows that allows for lots of light . service was friendly and were helpful with ordering although we felt we over ordered based on the waitresses recommendation-that ' s okay because we enjoyed it all ! pastas tasted homemade and were by far our favorite choices . menu was seasonal using fresh ingredients and presented beautifully . we told the host it was a friends birthday and was bummed that the dessert didn ' t come out with a candle or acknowledgement but the confetti cake was such a delicious dessert -tasted completely different then it looked and we were pleasantly surprised ! 
awesome , awesome , awesome . i cant really say more than that , but i ' ll try - ) we got to penny cluse on a friday , after trying magnolia but being rudely turned away . it was a toss-up as to our breakfast spot , so we ended up here . pure serendipity . we arrived around N Nish and the place was already half-full . good sign . but , we were seated quickly and got coffee just as fast . ( good coffee , too . . . ) . wow , what a menu ! can i have one of everything ? but , since we were were dining with our two-year old , we order with him in mind . my wife couldnt decide between the special french toast - zucchini bread french toast with a honey ricotta , or the omelette with fresh local mozzarella , organic tomatoes , basil and such . when she asked for the waitress ' recommendation , she told my wife she could get the omelette , and instead of toast , they could fix her one piece of the special french toast . sold ! how nice and accommodating they were . i got the bellber combo - N eggs scrambled ( soooo good . . and soooo fluffy ! ) , N gingerbread pancakes and home fries . awesome potatoes . . . yellow yukon golds with good seasoning and nice crust . anyway , our two year old got the nicest looking fruit plate this side of carmen miranda , and shared some of mine . oh , and so delicious , we went back saturday before leaving town . just as good . . . . almost worth the three hour drive from albany alone . 
amazing . not much else to say . great selection of wines and beers food that makes you want more and more - brussel sprouts , cheese plate , meatballs , gnocchi , and more . and always . . . . the budino . it ' s amazing
awesome for on-the-go lunch . grab a fork if you want to finish all the ingridients . i ' ll come back . there is no place to sit down here , it ' s just a walk-in stand by the counter or take it to go . 
i came for lunch with a friend yesterday and i have officially added it to my " fave restaurants list " . for the lunch special i ordered papri chaat as an appetizer ( my friend ordered some salmon appetizer thingy which was delicious ) and we both had the goan curry shrimp for the main course . it came with naan and rice . we were given pistachio kulfi for dessert but i ordered gulab jamun as well . the food was fantastic and i was stuffed ! i have indian friends so i ' m used to " authentic " south asian cuisine but i dont expect restaurants to have that " home cooked meal " feel because , hellooooo , it ' s a freakin restaurant ! as long as the food is good , i ' ll be happy . anyway , it ' s a gorgeous restaurant . very well kept and clean as a whistle . it ' s very easy to find and very convenient location wise . i would have given it N stars except the service was severely lacking . our waiter looked completely bored and uninterested . he wasn ' t rude but he wasn ' t personable at all ! cheer up sir ! it was a beautiful day ! other than that , if you want an affordable , cute little lunch dinner spot , benares is the place to go ! 
they really should have more crepe places all over the world ! the nutella banana and smores crepes were wonderful and gooey , and have the ability to forget you ' ve ever had a bad day . 
i saw some mixed reviews here , but i work nearby and know the place just opened up . as someone who has previously worked in the restaurant business , i know there can some bumps in the road when things get started , so i thought i would give them a chance - i ' m glad i did . they must have made some changes because what i got was very good . i got the meatball sandwich which i thought was very flavorful and fresh tasting . i think the price was in line with what they offer which is something that has premium ingredients . i will be back again and look forward to trying their pastas and other sandwiches . 
came here for dinner with a friend . i usually walk past this place and it ' s usually packed . we stuck our heads in to see if there was an available table for two . we lucked out and were seated within N minutes as the reservations were not until later that night . we ordered a bottle of cote du rhone to start with . the waitress was very attentive and nice . i ordered the ny strip steak frites and she had the poached cod . the food was good . nothing to wow about , but good . i must admit , there ' s really not much you can wow about steak frites to begin with . my friend thought her cod seemed like a small portion , but she was fairly stuffed towards the end of the night . we decided to share a desert of dark chocolate torte . we had some wine left over , so what better way to finish it up than with chocolate ? the dessert was also good . . . nothing to wow about , but good . we walked out of there fairly satisfied . we noticed how quickly the place filled up , mostly with couples or a small group of regulars . i ' ve always wanted to try this place out , so that ' s been crossed off the checklist . i think that it ' s a fairly solid french bistro kind of fare . the location is perfect and the atmosphere is between a romantic date spot and a go to spot amongst friends . i think that you can get the same quality of food at other french bistro ' s in the area , but this place has made a name for itself , so the it tends to be pricier ( and more of a wait . . . ) 
i luv barbs ! the pizza is delicious , the arugula is my favorite topping . i feel totally comfortable sitting at the bar alone with a glass of wine and enjoying my pizza . the staff is cool and very attentive . my favorite place to be on a weeknight . i do wish they had a better happy hour ! 
overall , i was very pleased with my whole experience here . they come highly recommended for dine-in , take-out or catering ! ! 
confessions of a fake ippudo lover okay , so don ' t kill me people , but i only like ippudo - i don ' t love it . this place has an intimidating , obsessed cult-like following that i could just never become a part of ( for them , not loving ippudo is committing culinary sacrilege against the ramen gods ) . i admit , i ' ve even tried to fake it by pretending to love ippudo in front of friends who constantly rave about it ( shameful , i know ) . it ' s just , i find the broth a little too salty for my taste , and sometimes a little too oily ( seriously , put your torches and pitchforks away ) . and really , its just a chain restaurant . but overall , it is a tasty place to eat . i always thoroughly enjoy anything pork on their menu ( esp . the roast pork over rice lunch special ) worth an hour midday wait ? probably not . anyway , i ' m finally outing myself , and no longer will i live in the closet as a non-lover of ippudo . however , if there ' s anyone out there with murderous inclinations as a result of this review , i was just kidding this whole time . i love ippudo . all hail ippudo ! 
don ' t get the hype . all the meat was overly salted , and the udon broth that i saw rave reviews about was awful . so overpriced for the quality of food . i ' ll much rather grab myself a steaming nabeyaki udon at soba-ya next door . 
the food was really terrific . the atmosphere is that of the typical good restaurant in nyc which is busy . it ' s clean , the service is good and we have never been disappointed . it ' s a must try for nyc . 
this is one of my favorite restaurants . it ' s a perfect blend of classic and modern , and on top of that , the sushi is top notch . i no longer live in the hartford area , but whenever i travel there i make a special effort to visit feng ' s . i ' m never disappointed in the service or quality . in fact , i ' m always impressed . servers and bartenders accurately explain the specials and take care of all customers as if they are regulars . i can ' t say enough good things about feng ' s ! get down there , listen to some classic jazz on the sound system , and enjoy some awesome rolls . it ' s all good ! 
only giving N star because i have to give at least N star . this place is terrible ! burgers are overcooked and greasy and service is beyond horrifying . they don ' t appreciate a minute that you are there giving them business . stay away at all costs . you ' ll save yourself time and money by just going to a mcdonald ' s near you . 
fantastic service and the food was delicious . you have to try the lamb lollipops they were amazing ! a little pricey but a great place to go for a different take on indian food . 
i went here for brunch with a friend . i suggested sugar freak because i kept passing by on the street and the storefront is so intriguing . we sat at one of the tall tables across from the bar so as to avoid the families with children seated at the tables in the back . they had no problem with me saving a table for two while my friend was running late . i had coffee , a mimosa , and a po boy sandwich . i don ' t usually do southern food , but i am a huge brunch fan , and this meal totally hit the spot ! my friend enjoyed her food as well . our server was very attentive and not in a big rush to kick us out ( granted there weren ' t any people waiting to be seated ) . i did notice that sugar freak was closed in june and july . the sign on the door said they would reopen in early july , but they still hadn ' t reopened when i left astoria on july N . it is a bummer because i totally wanted to eat brunch here one more time before i moved to dc ! 
this place is amazing . it ' s a tiny hole in the wall with a whole lot of good , super cheap food . love the dumplings ( both fried and boiled ) . can ' t wait go back ! 
i would give this place five stars , but it is contributing to my already expanded waist-line . so far my favorite is either the buffalo gal or the coney island . i am a bit scared to try some of the more out there dogs , but hopefully will get my name on the wall . the people are nice and it ' s good to find a place open at Nam on a weekend . only wish they were open later on the weekdays . the dogs are very filling , be warned . . . and addicting . 
what a terrific pub . the menu is out of this world , delicious lobster roll , burgers are exactly what you are looking for and coime with great fries . lobster mac and cheese , other great bar pub food including fish and chips and chili . full bar and wine and beer menu . full of local lunch business crowd and hopping at night . check it out , a really beautiful authentic and welcoming pub . 
love this place . second time coming within a week . foods great . especially the red velvet waffles with vanilla cream cheese . awesome service ! 
i ' ve known about the great reviews this place has been getting for maybe a year and i walk past it at least once a week but never go in because it just doesn ' t look like something i would like . looked corporate and more of a coffee shop cafe feel with a food menu i didn ' t care much for . finally went in . boy was i wrong . definite local feel with a much more bar feel than i would have thought . the inside was decorated really cool . couldn ' t put my finger on it why it looked so good but whatever it was it worked . the clientele i was wrong about as well . no tourists and pretty much everyone at the small bar were locals that all lived within a few blocks . the food itself was really tasty . i had the meatball sandwich but coming back for the salt sandwich . looked and smelled epic . regarding the mac and cheese everyone has been talking and about . . . meh . . . nothing special . in writing this review my mouth is watering because i keep thinking about the sandwich i only got a whiff of . i will be back . 
thank goodness for boho cafe . the sandwiches are awesome and filling . my personal favorite is the buffalo chicken with blue cheese . . . you just can ' t beat that . also the prices are totally reasonable . the only thing keeping me from giving this places N stars is the coffee and the decor . i don ' t know what look they are going for but it ' s quit the mishmosh . the iced coffee i got a few days ago was , to be frank , undrinkable . but despite that , the customer service is solid and so is the food . 
cliche
not that everyone out there does not already know - the penny cluse breakfast menu is perfect . great sandwiches for lunch that are very reasonably priced . long waits on the weekends can be a drag . i usually sneak in mid-week . love it ! 
bcd , why must you always torture me with your wait , even at N N on a wednesday afternoon ? all i want is to appreciate you to pick that fried little fish to the bone to inhale a bubbling , splattering pot of kimchi soondobu laden with so much meat and veggies - you deliciously balance my diet . your tofu is so silken and delicate . i love the way you liquefy as you ' re squeezed between my tongue and palate , so warm and spicy as you slide down my throat ( and i like it spicy ) . you ' re such a tease to make me wait , and seoul garden is right across the street , ready to put out as i walk through their door , but i can ' t help but keep coming back for you . 
this is a really cute neighborhood cafe with a little romantic appeal . i have had a salad with goat cheese croutons as well as a salad with smoked samon and homeade potato salad . both were absolutely delicious ! servers are always pleasant , although a bit scatter brained at time ( but honestly who isn ' t ? ) . i ' ve been for lunch as well as dinner . lunch is fairly calm ( if it ' s a hot day though this is not a refuge . not the best of ac units in this place ) and dinner is usually full but not much of a wait . i will definitely be a regular . 
it is quite difficult to judge dinosaur bbq based on the rather stiff bbq competition that has emerged throughout nyc over the course of the last few years . the various side dishes were quite tasty , specifically the black eyed peas braised with small pieces of bacon however when judging the brisket one must keep in mind the rather succulent specimens produced by fette sau , delaney by that measure dinosaur simply does not compete . however , i am quite the fan of the ambiance and it is a great place to hang out grab a drink and by all other accounts " fun " food for watching a game with a group of friends . 
i had dinner here on a weekday evening . we sat outside and the place was fairly crowded as it was thursday . i have heard many good things about stamna from greek- born friends as well as other greek food fans . i was definitely not disappointed . our waiter was very attentive and accommodating . he brought us some bread to nosh on and was helpful in suggesting popular dishes when we were stumped on what to order . ultimately i opted for a salad with grilled calamari and we split the gigantes appetizer between us . everything was fresh and delicious ! special thanks to our waiter who gave us a free dessert which consisted of sweet dough pastries . i will definitely be back ! 
i was visiting from out of town and was in the area buying souveniers . my son ( who lives in new york ) and i wanted italian food and checked several restaurants in the area . trattoria trecolori had the best prices by far , so we went there . it was a friday night so it was busy and loud . in other words , typical ny restaurant . we had a little bit of a wait while some tables cleared and once we were seated , our waiter took too long in between visits to check on us . however , when he did , he was attentive and thorough . minor incoveniences , we felt . an exception to this was we did not notice the specials posted at the entrance and our waiter did not mention them until after we ' d labored over our menus trying to make our selections . each of our dishes were great , chicken parmigiana and fettucini alfredo w chicken . the prices were quite reasonable and the food was excellent . i will definitely return to trattoria trecolori whenever i visit new york ! 
such an odd location on elm st for a shop like this , where this same place was a deli many years ago . still , it ' s a nice and different type of grub in a town like this . . . kearny , where i was raised . it ' s a simple place , with a couple of tables and five or six booths . order at the counter and after N or so minutes , you ' ll have these versions of hot pockets in front of you . we tried each of the vegetarian variety , of which there are six . spinach and mushroom , spinach and cheese , broccoli and corn , corn and vegetable , broccoli and cheese , macaroni and cheese , and mozzarella and tomato which was called a calabrese and was , by far , the best of the bunch . while the crust was quite good , we found the filling having a lack of seasoning . garlic , onion , typical argentinian seasonings would have been welcomed here . this didn ' t make them bad at all , just not a standout product . service was friendly and prices were reasonable . six empanadas and a bottled water for N . everything was made by hand , freshly stuffed on the spot . stop in for something different , but not if you ' re looking for authentic cuisine . 
best . bagels . ever ! ! ! their breakfast sandwiches are great . friendly quick service . but , really , their bagels are spectacular ! 
i went there this morning ordered a bagel with cream cheese . . . kid behind the counter says " you want coffee with that ? " i said no thanks , he then says " c ' mon , spend some more money ! " i don ' t think i ' ll be spending any more there . . . . . . 
best wings in town ! the hot sweet sauce is always a hit when i bring someone for their first time . every now and then , they will feature a new item as a weekly special . this week , they featured a bbq flatbread that i loved . also , the staff is very nice . if you ' re looking for a great bar to catch your favorite team play , this is just the place . they also have two pool tables ! ) 
a must see in nyc . the first and lives up to the hype in taste . it ' s all about the crust - can ' t be matched . N in the country so far . --jer
ha a Npm saturday reservation to celebrate my wife ' s birthday . ordered the N course prix fix menu with the waiter picking the courses for my wife . plating was very nice and the food was great with portions slightly smaller than i would have liked . a nice touch at the end with some chocolates and a birthday candle decibel level in the room is great for conversation . we will definitely eat here again . 
this place introduced me to greek food and because of it , i now have a high standard for greek food all over the world . i ' ll been here on multiple occasions for different reasons , there was an experience of a part of N , there was an experience of a party of N , and there was even an experience of a party of N . all occurances were equally excellent . the first time i went here , unsure as to what i should order , the dishes were recommended by the server . he was great . extremely friendly and knew his dishes inside and out . these are the dishes i would recommend hot mezedes octopodi - charcoal grilled octopus with red and white onions , dill , roasted peppers , capers , parsley and red wine vinaigrette yemista kalamarakia - calamari stuffed with a trio of greek cheeses , grilled served with lemon and extra virgin olive oil midia estia - new zealand mussels , metaxa , ouzo , shallots , dill , diced tomato and feta spread pikilia - tzatziki , htipiti , melitzano salata served with grilled pita also available individually a word or two about their fishes - they are extremely fresh and are their catch of the day . you can also say hi to your fish of choice before it gets beheaded . i recommend doing their seafood fish tour before ordering . this will give you an idea as to which fish you might be protentially ordering . i won ' t order these fishes without taking a peak . i ' ve tried their fishes , but have never tried their other " land " dishes . however , with the large party , most of the dishes on the menu got ordered ( some repeated ) . the final review ? all the dishes served by the restaurant is excellent . . . ! so why the N stars ? the level of service , ( incrediablly good ) not a five star . yes , they ' re highly attentive , very knowledgable , however , it is not a N star rating ( but this is just my opinion ) . i highly recommend this place and i highly push suggest that you order try something you would not normally eat elsewhere . worth the money , worth the experience ! 
if i was just rating the service staff and the food i would give five stars , but since i ' m rating the whole experience its N . the front door people are so ridiculous it blows my mind . i ' ve been Nx in the past N years and the each time the hostesses get worse and worse . there ' s always a wait but when someone tells you you ' re crazy for wiling N hours and then is rude when you that ' s fine it incomprehensible . for one its really not that hard to estimate the wait when you know how many tables there are , the average time per table , and they take your number to supposedly call you when it ' s getting close . instead they give you a useless expected wait time , then occasionally walk around to see whose still around that is on the list , randomly calling names ( yet the took your number to call you though they never call ) , and then after an hour or so when you check back in they act like your crazy for asking how much longer . it ' s great that they have a restaurant with the best ramen in the city and can get away with millions of tourists willing to deal with absurd wait policies , but when your core voting constituency has to constantly deal with such nonsense , you are destined for failure . if the japanese owners knew what rude and poor service that the hostesses provided i guarantee they ' d have a breakdown . my prediction is ippudo ' s will not be profitable in a years time . everytime i ' ve been there recently the crowds are less and less . eventually people will be over the ramen trend and when they are the core crowd will already be gone . good luck ass holes . sye a nora ! ! you won ' t see this patron again , just out of principle .

we have been coming to green eggs since it opened . unfortunately , the overall quality has gone down hill over the years . we have been visiting less frequently than before , and during our previous visit in january everything was well below expectations . when we read that they hired a new chef and the excitement they seemed to have about him , we decided to return . today , we were sat and given dirty menus that were old and the laminating was peeling from the corners . our server was beyond unfriendly and never cracked a smile the entire time we were there . when our food was delivered , my husband ' s coffee was empty . no one ever filled it throughout the meal even though we watched our server stand at the service station staring into space the entire time we ate . my waffle was so cold that the butter didn ' t even have a chance of melting and the cold syrup didn ' t help anything . i never send food back , but this was inedible . we flagged down a server walking by and told him . he got the manager who took the waffle away and asked if i wanted a new one made , but never apologized . after my husband finished his food , we sat for sometime still with no coffee and no server . finally , i waved to our server who was still staring into space . she turned her back for a few minutes and then when she turned back around , she proceeded to drink her coffee at the service station . it must have been nice to have coffee at breakfast ! ! ! ! ! after we finally got the check from another server , no one ever came back . when we left our server was hanging out at the host stand gossiping with the manager and host . this was a terrible dinning experience and it felt more like an ihop than a quality cafe . 
i was at harry ' s the other day for breakfast with a large group . while the servers were quite abit friendlier than they used to be at the farmington avenue location , the food was still alright , nothing special and overpriced ( i know , it ' s west hartford ) , but the service was slow . granted we had a group of N , but breakfast took forever to get to the table and we were one of the first ones in the restaurant . now , i use to come here for breakfast almost every saturday for N years after a run when they were still on farmington avenue . the service was never very good . the servers were quite unfriendly , but it was right next door to fleet feet so very convenient . that will teach me to put convenience over service ! nothing exceptional . . . i haven ' t ventured over to the new location in glastonbury and i live there ! plus , their pizza can ' t measure up to giovanni ' s in glastonbury ! and i look forward to finding a better breakfast brunch place in west hartford center . . . won ' t be hard after eating at harry ' s . 
in the heart of the theater district , carmine ' s serves italian in huge family style portions , my wife i got chicken parmigiana ( N ) and took half of it home , so go with at least three or preferably four people . everything is a la carte , including pasta and salad ( which were immense ) . quality was good , not great and the place is very loud so , it ' s a great location for a romantic dinners or even conversation , but it is an experience and close to most broadway theaters . 
what a surprise , usually when i am going to a sushi place i won ' t even look at veggie only rolls , but to my girlfriend request i agreed to try and well it was worth trying ! the sushi there is unique - from the special rice they are using ( N grain and black chinese forbidden rice - first time i even heard about it . . . ) to the smart combination of fruits and vegetables . not the regular vegetable sushi you will find in other sushi places . we had the haricat ( haricot , carrot , mango ) , ' pickle me ' ( carrot , pickled daikon and avocado ) , the mushroom roll ( enoki , shitake , tofu , micro arugula ) and spicy mango ( avocado , mango and cucumber topped with spicy vegetables ) - all good ( the ' pickle me ' was my favorite ) overall the experience was very good , the place is clean and the decor is very nice as well , the chef is preparing the sushi on the spot in front of you . and the taste is amazing you actually feel you are eating healthy food . i would recommend this place and i believe i will come back
turns out , i ' ve been to the neighborhood before , but i missed graffiti because of the tiny little door . but , after watching the next iron chef and becoming a huge fan of chef mehta , i of course looked him up and just had to go to his restaurant . first impression it ' s a lot smaller than you think it is from the pictures online--a crowded corridor at best , which is made even more crowded by the knicknacks and the measly four tables that occupy the area . add in customers and the waiters , it becomes very difficult to move around , and you have to squish yourself into a very small space in order to get to your table . we were put on a communal table , which was a tight fit as well . that being said , i absolutely loved this place . even though it ' s tiny , or maybe because it ' s so tiny , it completely embodies the whole eclectic , east village atmosphere . it ' s dimly lit , with adorable mini chandeliers hanging haphazardly from the ceiling and a very efficient ( yet quaint ) setting of newspapers as placemats . service was great , the servers were very considerate and our glasses were never more than half empty of water . also , we got a very in-depth description of our food , along with what ingredients were supposed to do what in your mouth--very iron chef ! food the graffiti burger was served with garlic fingerling potatoes and chipotle mayo , and was definitely the highlight of the meal . they were small , two slider burgers with a piece of lettuce and some red onions on top and lightly toasted bread . it was an explosion of flavor , especially with the chipotle mayo spread on top . i can ' t name the exact herbs that were in the burger , but it ' s safe to say that they definitely worked well together , and with the meat . we also tried the shredded pork buns with apricot chutney , which were just as delightful--the pork was flavorful , and there were cornflakes on top , which gave it an added crunch and just an interesting assortment of textures in your mouth . the apricot chutney was freshly made , and apparently had pits in it , but that didn ' t take away from the meal at all . for dessert , we tried the cupcake , and the strawberries with the pepper ice cream . the cupcake is arguably the best one i ' ve ever had--makes sense , chef mehta ' s a pastry chef ! the pepper ice cream was also interesting when aired with the warm strawberries , but the cupcake was definitely the standout of the two . i ' m disappointed we didn ' t get to try the zuccini hummus pasta or the green mango paneer , but i have very concrete plans to go back and try the entire menu ! 
great wings and tuna sandwich not the best place for date-night but the food is good
well what can i say that N others have ? not much . . ramen - try the akamaru - if you plan to order extra toppings , get them on the side , you usually get more ( insider tip ! ) must get pork buns , N per order - they don ' t take reservations in adv . same day reservations are taken in person though - avoid the wait , go at N N pm to get in line for N-N N pm for dinner - happy hour N for N drafts N-Npm ( standing bar only ) - high volume and fast turnovers - not good for big groups because the most they can accommodate is N comfortably in a booth . groups of N and N have been done but it ' s tight . bathrooms to the right of the hosts and hostesses , downstairs . fyi - yes ippudo uses msg in their ramen , that ' s why it ' s so good . food N decor N .

went to jane yesterday for sunday brunch . loved that you could actually make a reservation - when we arrived ( N minutes late ) we were seated immediately . the ambiance is nice - big and open with high ceilings , and a big brunch crowd . seating is a little tight , but not unbearable . many of the entrees included a free cocktail which was a nice perk . food arrived lightning fast , though the waiter forgot about our drinks until we reminded him . my friend and i both ordered the vanilla bean french toast and were hugely disappointed . didn ' t taste at all like vanilla and was completely soggy and mushy on the inside . seemed completely uncooked . at tables around us , the egg dishes and more savory lunch items all looked and smelled delicious . french toast was a huge flop . 
the only thing i tried was the brussels sprouts . so that was good but there wasn ' t anything that made me want to come back . 
best sushi . . . love it
went for brunch and we had breakfast burrito , collard greens , fatty brisket , mac and cheese and pancakes . everything was delicious , and service was good . i will definitely be back . 
waiter service quite good . very generous portions all around , most impressive of which was the calamari . good for your basic thai needs . comfortable atmosphere , though they do tend to get quite busy . have been there twice and plan on going back . 
our server was very pleasant , marc was there and was kind enough to pose in a photo with us . nice selection of appetizers , the chili lobster was top notch as was the foie gras , i highly recommend both . i have to ding marc on two things . one , the drink menu is very limited , i believe there were only N or N mixed drinks listed and they were all very uninspired . two , there were only seven entrees ( aside from the chicken-under-a-brick for two ) and out of the seven four were whole fish . i ' m sure they are wonderful , we didn ' t order any of them , but no veal ? no shrimp ? no chicken for one ? only one steak and one pork dish . . . . . . this area of the menu needs some expansion . pricing was fair for this caliber of restaurant , much more reasonable than bouley which is two blocks away . 
have these guys changed ? meat is not as chopped up and the past N times i bought , the bags were white . have the Nrd Nth ave original guys left ? 
one word overrated . 
good happy hour , N cheesburgers . nice bar area , the service at the bar has been consistantly excellent . happy hour daily N-N and N-N on week days and N-close on fri-saturdays ! 
the place was packed for a saturday brunch , and we mistakenly think it is a sign for great food . well , we were wrong . we ordered the mac and cheese for appetizer , as recommended by foursquare reviews , and it wasn ' t much better than what i can whip out of my own studio kitchen . my salmon entree was so tiny , that i wonder if i should ask the waiter so where is the rest of the fish ? the only positive thing was our waiter , because he was so nice and funny . but , i came for food , not for laughs . . . 
great brunch ! gets crowded on sundays but worth the wait . 
yum ! ! ! ! N of us went to newark to see trans-siberian orchestra sunday and decided to go out for dinner afterward . during the week , we checked out yelp and found denovo - we made reservations for N N . we were on way , but hitting some traffic , so i called to confirm and let them know we ' d be a little late ( we were only about N minutes late ) and they were very understanding . we were seated and the bus boy came around with water ( we asked him to fill up all N glasses , but he only filled the N of us who were there ) . we checked out the menu and the drink menu - my husband and i are craft beer drinkers and they have a really nice , diverse selection of craft beers . i had a brooklyn chocolate stout and hubby had a terrapin wake and bake - both were excellent choices ( the waiter asked if we wanted frozen mugs - we don ' t like frozen mugs , so we really appreciated the fact that he asked and brought us regular mugs ! ) we also had la chouffe bottles , which is a nice belgian strong pale ale - very crisp and refreshing . they have a full bar , so the wine and vodka drinkers at the table were happy as well . our waiter , eric , was very friendly and accommodating . the restaurant itself is very cool - it ' s an old train station , so the train does pass right outside the windows , but it ' s much quieter than you ' d expect . the atmosphere is very cool - can be a bit romantic with candles on the tables and soft lighting , but it ' s also good for larger parties ( we were N ) . for a sunday night , around N N N N , they had a really nice crowd - a few tables were still available . there are a few seats at the bar ( maybe N ? ? ) and another longer table to the side of the bar - it looks like just a communal lounge table with barstools - the rest of the dining area is tables and bench seating . bread , similar to a focaccia is served with herbed oil for dipping - the bread is really tasty and fluffy - not dense and heavy . hubby and i ordered the burrata pugliese , eggplant caponata ( burrata cheese served over arugula with an eggplant caponata and a hint of balsamic glaze ) - quite tasty ! ! and a good size to split . our friends ordered the split pea soup and the special , a curried butternut squash soup . all of them licked their bowls clean ! ( the only issue with the soup is the bowls . . . the servers almost dumped N out of N of them on our friends because they are very wide , but shallow bowls , filled with hot soup . suggestion ? get deeper bowls - easier to serve - might not look as " sexy " , but much more functional , and less chance of scalding your guests ! ) for dinner , i took the safe way out - not sure why - i like to experiment , but it just sounded so good too - i ordered the penne , penne pasta with tomatos , pine nuts , basil pesto , fresh ricotta -the pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was not overpowering . it was very good , but i should have tried the hangar steak or the tuna . my mom got the tuna , and unfortunately she ordered it medium . it was cooked to a perfect medium - which she wanted , but to me , she destroyed a beautiful piece of fish . . . . never eat tuna more than medium rare - you need that pink-ness , otherwise , just open a can of chicken of the sea ! ! i tried a piece and even though she ordered it at the wrong temp , it was still fantastic . my husband and our friend ordered the fettuccine with fennel - i was afraid the fennel ( which is a licorice flavor ) would be so over-powering , but was i wrong . it was fettuccine in a creamy sauce , again , not over-powering . i took my husband ' s leftovers for lunch today ! i would definitely order that if i was in a pasta mood . everybody was very pleased with their meals , and the only reason there were left-overs is because we had appetizers and the portions are pretty decent in size . our friend ' s son ordered the seafood stew which was filled with clams , mussels , shrimp , calamari , and salmon in a lite tomato broth . that looked really good - and he said it was very tasty . a flat bread pizza was ordered , along with a mushroom cheeseburger and linguini with white clam sauce . we also had a couple desserts ( gelato and biscottis ) . . . the bill , for N soups , an app , about N beers , N mixed drinks , wine , N entrees and N desserts came to around N . definitely a great price for a great meal ! kudos to de novo - i think you have a great thing going ! ! and we will be back because i want the tuna , the hangar steak , the chicken breast , and the short ribs . i guess we ' ll have to come back a few times ! ( ps - a little upset the owner manager didn ' t pay our lovely table a visit - but we did notice that he was present throughout the night , which is nice to know - at least he can see what ' s going on and he cares to know what ' s going on ! ) 
stopped by here on new year ' s day looking for some grub as most of our local joints were closed . it was around Npm and not super crowded . my hubs and i used to come to this place all the time years ago when we lived in lincoln park , it was the matthews back then . since then the place has upgraded a bit with some different decorations etc , it looks cleaner , and the menu offers a little more variety . we were greeted by our waitress and places our drink orders and shortly after placed our food orders . this is when the experience kina went south . we waited at least N minutes for N panini ' s , the whole time not being told by our waitress why there was a delay or offering anything else . in fact , she proceeded to count her tips in the open two times while we eyed her waiting for our food . . . totally unprofessional imo . food finally comes out and looks good . i got a chicken cordon bleu panini and husband got an italian sandwich type with a side of disco fries . the sandwiches were pretty good , certainly no reason for taking N minutes tho . mine was missing sauce but considering how long food took i decided to cut my losses . my fries were tasty , husbands disco fries were weak . gravy was ehhh cheese wasn ' t melty . everything was served on long rectangle plates and little wire baskets . while this is cute , i would have preferred a good old fashioned round plate and had my food faster . also on a side note , it appeared the hostess was having an issue w one of the servers while we were there . she went back and forth between what seemed like chastising this woman and then talking to others about it . idk what actually was happening but she was mad about something . this place is out of our way and based on our experience alone we prob won ' t be back often . could have just been an off-day . husband tipped well which i was not good with but i suppose he wanted to be nice on new years . 
very tasty and inexpensive . love this place . 
sunday is the day to go . the N course a la carte menu was awesome . byobs are always great and the service was amazing . definitely a place you should try if you enjoy food . N bucks total for N . it was my first time eating beets and the beet salad was delicious . a great place for a date . 
let me tell you something about this place . it ' s awful ! they are trying to be an upscale peruvian restaurant but they are not . please ! these people need to get real . they look like a trashy bar from the outside , once you go in they are trying to hard to look upscale but they are not . food is way too expensive for how it tastes and the service is horrible ! however , i did see a lady manager and she was annoying the shit out of her waitresses so maybe that is why . i can not blame them . will never go again and do no recommend you to go either . 
omg love codys ! cheap , big portions , delicious food ! have tried other diners like three brothers on dixwell horrible ! codys is the spot ! 
siggy ' s is awesome . it ' s a pretty much go to place if you are looking for quality food . i love the spinach quinoa cakes , as well as the lentil soup ) 
finally lic has a great japanese restaurant ! great service - great food . no need to get to midtown east for my sushi fix . 
i went into marigold ' s with high expectations after reading reviews and looking over the menu . usually all the hype leads to disappointment . but i was really amazed at culinary skill evident in the menu and dishes . i ' ve eaten or worked at some of the best restaurants in boston , san francisco , and philadelphia , and the quality of this meal surpassed or was on par with N and N star restaurants . we each had the four course option . what struck me most was the way chef rob halpern played with texture and temperature . this definitely seemed to be where he was pushing , rather than mimicking , culinary trends . the play on texture went well beyond the cliche foams too , solids were turned into liquids , smooth balanced with crispy , and the serious was balanced with whimsy like liquid nitrogen popcorn . the best part is not only was the food cutting edge in terms of technique and presentation , but the flavors across multiple courses ranged from good to truly exceptional . staff was friendly , attentive , knowledgeable and unpretentious ( which is rare ) . the generous portion sizes left me full despite having a hearty appetite . the only minor knock is that some dishes were a little heavy on butter and salt , but i also tend to eat healthy so my palate may be oversensitive and some more vegetarian options would be a welcome addition . but overall , combine exceptional food with unpretentious service , and i have a favorite new restaurant . this was without exaggeration one of the best meals i ' ve ever eaten . my experience was night and day different compared to the reviewers that came during the uc dining days promotion . i don ' t write a lot of reviews , but i was so impressed with this little gem i had to write something . 
take some elusive giant squid , throw out those displeasing tentacle parts , then deep fry what ' s left , and serve it with a side of awe inspiring tomato sauce . . . . . and you have some of the best calamari anywhere . i see that this place is categorized under " dive bar " , and that ' s fair , beer is stale here ( let ' s pretend it adds to the atmosphere ) and it ' s mainly frequented by blue collar folk ( truck drivers , longshoreman , firefighters , etc . ) . what makes this place stand out though is the fact that it has good bar food . fried seafood , burgers , deli sandwiches , all good for a quick , filling , and cheap lunch to those who work in newark , but i feel that to most ny yelpers daytripping to newark , this place will be sought after more the " experience " than the food . i would rate this place N stars if it wasn ' t for persistent smell of ammonia , but that tells me the place is clean though , no ? 
love love love their pizza and soup ) 
ordered delivery from here and got the quacomole and chips and the quesadilla los gallos for myself . . . it is now two days later and i ' m ordering the same exact thing . excellent food best mexian delivery i have found in my N years in the city . go flyers ! 
wasn ' t a fan . pretty boring steaks all around , really stale . good to check out though . it ' s a must , maybe others have a better experience . 
food was terrible . waitress smelled like an ashtray . 
i waited N min to be seated ! then where i was seated the carpted is ripped and staind then the food was cold then i tryed to tell the owner he could not speak english really never comming back then i found hair i my food vomit
i ' ve never eaten here , but it ' s a good place for a beer or glass of wine . there ' s no tv , which is great and the music comes from the bartenders ipod . no loud drunk college kids well rarely . it is a block away from south street , so you do get rowdy patrons sometimes and then it gets loud and crowded . 
love , love , love ! they have a great menu ! i wish they had one in brooklyn . they always have a small wait but well worth the wait . i strongly recommend the N vegetable side dish , they have tons to choose from . i always get the pesto mashed potatoes , brussels sprouts , asparagus and kale amazing and enough for two people to share . i also recommend the catfish po ' boy and the fish and chips ! delicious . you really can ' t go wrong here . everything i have tried has been delicious ! i will be becoming the duke of this place soon . 
this place used to be artica ( sp ? ) and i have to say w b is a very welcomed change . found in the murray hill location , which is usually suspect , however its been retained by the same owner , that in my humble opinion has done a superlative job in renovating and reinventing the place . his efforts should earn major accolades . we ' ve been to w b over N times and will continue to - w b has yet to disappoint - overly nice service and the the menu is clever and delicious . get the bruschetta-its with roasted chick peas scallops are delish and . you should just go ! 
excellent service , nice atmosphere , friendly staff . full bar . excellent N cheese ravioli in bolognese sauce . 
burgers are great . i was disappointed in the duck fat fries . they had the manliest drink i have ever had . its basically whisky and lemon . felt burny going down but was still great . 
the staff is ultra friendly and the food okay . they didnt put olives in my martini . the problem is that i went at Npm . if you go after Npm when the show crowd has left i am sure everything is much better . 
love this place . great prices and food . the rolls are a bit smaller so order an extra if you ' re super hungry . 
my wife and i have been going here for years and are never disappointed . 
i must of had a bad experience or maybe i know what wood fire pizza should taste like . it is also cool seeing a huge jar of pre-peeled garlic . . . that ' s how the italians do it right ? 
wayy overhyped ! not worth it standing in the rain on a cold ny night ! the white sauce is just ranch dressing - . - the hot red sauce you can get at any asian store , the lamb you can get at any greek place . nothing special for such overhyped ratings . we just went to ny this past weekend , and let me warn other people to not even bother making the trip over . you can do better somewhere else . the only positive thing i can say is that the portions are big for N . that ' s it . 
sunday brunch ! this is the place to be , although you need to snack a little bit because just like any other good brunch place . there is always a wait . they have few cute seats outside facing the street . great for people watching on a sunday day . i ordered asparagus and mushroom salad . it was amazing . it ' s perfect for a hot summer day if you want to eat light . it located on a very cute street too , perfect for date , small group ! i believe you will wait for a long time for a large group . i want to come back here to try the dinner sometimes soon ! 
october N came a long way to pay our respects to heath ledger ' s project and enjoyed N great bottles of bud at Npm in the afternoon . we would have eaten but the cooker was out of action ! would have loved to have stayed into the evening but only on a four day trip to ny . we headed off into the rain with two donated umbrellas . thank you granville . 
this place was great . went on a double and we all ordered something . i got the truffle parm fries , a chocolate milk shake and of course . . the bb burger ( medium ) . all was very delicious . i will be coming back again . 
long time of waiting , weird night club music , seriously ? ridiculous price compare to their food size , N ramen is half the size of other place . the taste is so-so , don ' t listen to people say it ' s the best their ever have , probably noobs , like somalian think mcdonald ' s has greatest burger in the world . if you going there for ramen , definitely will be disappointed , avoid ! if you go there for party , ignore me , but seriously , find a doctor , go to a ramen shop to party ? ? 
my boyfriend and i go here for brunch multiple times per month . it is delicious , has consistently good service , and the brunch special makes it cost-effective as well . we ' d definitely recommend it as a reliable and quality brunch spot in nyc . try the eggs benedict and the french toast , and make sure to get a side of home fries . 
palma is perfect . the covered back garden looks like something out of a fairytale , with fresh roses everywhere on the vine covered brick walls , its like stepping back in time , if they had really , really good food back then . i would recommend this restaurant to really anyone but at night with the christmas lights and flowers , it would make an excellent romantic date restaurant . during the day , come here for brunch and prepare to instantly be put in a good mood by the bright sunlight and happy , shabby chic atmosphere . the food is excellent . for brunch , we got eggs benedict , the burrata and a salad and everything was perfectly cooked and served . we had the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake for dessert . just get it . the the service was just as good . our waiter was attentive without being overbearing . i will definitely , definitely be back to try dinner . 
best italian byo spot we have found in philly ! 
everything fine just feels touristy- i love how they get away with serving you whenever your food is ready one person at a time- kudos
amazing selection , and personable staff as i experienced . must try for a visit to philadelphia . 
amazing restaurant in the old cebu location . for starters , their location is great , right on chestnut , around the corner of Nnd st . the restaurant is in the same location as an old lounge called cebu , so it has really high ceilings and a very cool , hip ambiance to it . i got dinner here last saturday with a bunch of friends after running a Nk and hanging around philly all day . this place has a ton of vegetarian options . i ' ve gotten takeout from the han dynasty ( handy nasty as people like to call it ) from the university city location , but i ' ve never eaten at this restaurant . our waiter was fairly attentive , even though they were super busy on saturday evening . half the table was vegetarian so we decided to order a bunch of apps and entree ' s and just split them . here ' s what we got cold noodles with chili oil - these were probably some of the best noodles i ' ve ever had ! they were spicy , but good spicy , and you could definitely taste the chili oil sauce . the noodles were cooked perfectly and for those of you who don ' t eat eggs , it ' s eggless . by far my favorite dish of the evening . scallion pancakes - very tasty as well . a few small pancakes come on a dish and they ' re nice and soft . . . chewy , but not too much . spring rolls - just had to get them - they ' re normal spring rolls . . . can ' t really mess them up cumin-style tofu - you can really taste the cumin in this dish - if you like cumin , you ' ll love it ! eggplant with garlic sauce - this was full of eggplant and veggies in this delicious , rich , dark garlic soy sauce . it tasted really good with rice mixed in . veggie fried rice - this was very good and it wasn ' t dry . . . sometimes , rice can be dry . overall , i love this restaurant . everything from the ambiance , location , food , service , and price . it was delicious and i ' ll be back when i " m down in philly again . 
best steamed pork buns ever ! nice atmosphere , decent service and very good food . i had terribly high expectations , and only the pork buns exceeded my hopes . connected to the milk bar , the food is worth the calories more than the desserts next door . 
 location next to the flatiron building . how to eataly is a large and upscale italian market . wander the aisles to look for gourmet italian products and visit the fresh food counters for homemade pasta or fresh seafood . i love coming to eataly to eat delicious italian food made from scratch . food bread and olive oil the eateries serve butcher paper-wrapped bread that is always freshly baked . it is served alongside high quality thick and viscous olive oil . you can get balsamic vinegar if you ask for it capricciosa pizza enough meat ( ham ) for the meat lovers and veggies ( mushrooms , olives , and artichokes ) to satiate the veggie lovers . the pizza is thin crust and crispy on the edges while soft in the middle . one of my fave pizzas in nyc margherita pizza simple and elegant with fresh mozzarella cheese pansotti with lemon butter sauce little raviolis filled with cheese in a tart yet creamy butter sauce . sounds simple , but the flavors were very rich . sparkling wines i love the white sparkling wines served at eataly . perfectly sweet and bubbly
very flavorful food i enjoyed this food . the chicken was moist and the rice and beans . . omg ! so good
the pizza here is pretty good , but the service was a little lacking . the hostess seemed frustrated with us because we waited at the front of the restaurant for our table instead of at the bar . she kept suggesting we have a drink at the bar , but we don ' t drink so we declined , until she finally just told us to leave . we went to the bar to wait for our table which we saw was being prepared for us . it sat vacant for a little while , so my friend went to the front to ask if that was indeed our table . before she opened her mouth , the hostess gave her a very annoyed glance and looked away . my friend decided not to exacerbate the situation and left her alone . we were seated shortly after . our waiter was cordial and took our order right away . the people serving the food didn ' t seem happy though . we ordered a coffee and as the guy was setting it down , he gave it a toss and the coffee splashed onto the table . it was so appalling , all we could do was laugh about it . still gave a generous tip , but probably won ' t be back any time soon . 
the bartender steve has been rude and arrogant . no eye contact , arms in front of the heart all time , not answering basic questions about the wines on the board , trying to avoid the contact with customers , instead of engaging with them . . . i wanted to leave , when the manager that i called , was kind enough to move me to another part of the restaurant even if i was alone . she didn ' t seem though to have decided to take action against him , and she looked almost scared because she said that he was there for long time and untouchable . . . no more there with that steve ! 
came here for brunch on a sunday for a party of N . good service , had to wait for only N mins . location is good as well , lots to do in the area after brunch . i got the salmon eggs benedict which was good . 
overall probably one of the best places to eat on the island . the staff was friendly , helpful , and extremely attentive . the atmosphere was cozy . prices were very reasonable and last but not least the food was great . we started with the corn nuggets which was a sweet corn mash , breaded and fried ( yum ) . my girlfriend had a vegetable dish ( they had N veggie dishes on the menu ) that had fresh yellow and green squash sauteed with onions and corn ( not many places , and i had the drunken shrimp . the entire dining experience was supurb . we will continue to visit adobe blues on a regular basis . 
went into the hummus pita co . to find a very clean , organized , mcdonaldized version of mediterranean food . thought mcdonaldization is often bereft of positive qualities , - it actually works here . it ' s a convenient , quick , cheap place to get your med-fix . 
you want a great bite in a place that has got a it right ! the breakroom knows what people want when it comes to the taste of food . the hot dog with jalapenos and bacon is awesome ! the bacon is crispy and is wrapped around the hot dog that has that skin snap to it that i personally love . my friends and i went down ordering almost everything on the menu to sample . if i had more of an appetite i definitely would have ordered more . the steak taco is very flavorful and the fries . . . o . m . g . i am definitely going back . 
a decent diner . however , it ' s not open N hours like typical diners in the area are . the price of food is a bit pricey for diner food , especially considering its location . the service here is average , nothing overly great , but usually not too bad . 
i love el vez ! during the warmer months , it is an excellent area to sit outside and enjoy a few drinks people watch ! or , sit inside and enjoy the wonderfully eclectic decor . they have really really good drinks , not to mention amazing food . it is reasonably priced for what you get . i really miss their surf and turf tacos , and it would be a shame if they don ' t bring them back to their menu . i will be returning to el vez probably about twice a year , only because i want to try out new places . this is a really great spot and i recommend everyone who is visiting philly to come here ! 
simplistic yet effective . their business model keeps them packed and there ' s a reason - the food is worth the wait . there ' s no hype here , if you can look past the ominous line on weekends and are willing to put up with imperfect service , your taste buds are sure to be rewarded . they host an assortment of frittatas and usually have a good slew of specials each weekend . their glory cakes are a good staple but their weekend special glory cakes are typically better . they have monkey bread french toast which is mind blowingly sweet , truculent to the point of additive . they have good eggs and potatoes , homemade ketchup that ' s tasty but their biscuits . . . . oh my god . the biscuits get their own paragraph . they are thick , dry and crumbly . what you do to make them awesome is pour some of their homemade jam or ask for honey on them and they get super delicious . you can ' t go wrong with these things as a dessert after devouring a plate of eggs and fries . fresh squeezed juice , yummy muffins , fresh desserts - it ' s all great . here is the one bummer , their coffee , which is served in coleman stove camping mugs , it ' s yucky . i love coffee with breakfast but i ' ll generally have my fill at morning glory then walk to chapterhouse for the coffee . sorry guys , it sucks . the service is very hit and miss and weekend waits are rough so if you want to beat the wait , i ' d get there about N N . 
stopped by here on a busy friday night and got a table outside which was nice . they have a pretty good drink selection so i got a white sangria which was tasty and my husband got a margarita which he loved ! we then had the bruschetta which i would definitely recommend not getting as it wasn ' t an impressive flavor combination but if you like olives perhaps you would enjoy . the complimentary rolls were tasty - crusty on the outside but soft on the inside , and the olive oil was nicely seasoned with fresh herbs . we then ordered the four cheese pizza to share which was pretty cheesy and cooked well but the pizza and toppings both lacked flavor . overall the food was okay and it was difficult to get our severs attention - perhaps he had too many tables ? not sure but probably won ' t be a headed back to this place in the near future unless we hear better things about their pasta options ! 
on way back home from new england , we had to go to philly , and we stopped in here to check it out . very cool place , very philly . if you are not familiar with philly , it is fast paced , the people are on the go , and you have to keep up . this place is no different ! we snacked on food from a bunch of places , can ' t remember the names , but i do remember a pork sandwich with kolerabi ( spelling ? ) that was really good . i think is was dinic ' s ? i would stop there and get one definitely . the people were nice , not like what you hear about ( of course we were not at a football game so i am sure they are different there ) . we did not get any produce or meats or anything like that . it seems like the groceries were pretty fresh , with that many people in and out , they must move food fast . if we lived there , i would know more , but as a tourist had no need . stuck with the meals . cool place , a must stop if you are in philly
it ' s a hole-in-the-wall place . small , not really fancy , but the food more than makes up for the lack of decor . if you ' re someone who places decor above the the taste of cuisine , then this place might not be your thing . the curry is amazing . the malaysian milk tea is great , if you can overlook the sweetness of it ( they use condensed milk , what do you expect ) . great food at not-so expensive prices . 
good and quick service , but the food is like bar type quality food-only good in the middle of the night after going out , i ' d say ! the staff is very much experienced in handling the crowds . 
this place has great panini ' s but they can ' t pay attention to you very well . i ' m a very picky eater , so i went in , told them what kind of panini i wanted and left to go home . i opened it up at home , and they added stuff i didn ' t even request and didn ' t add stuff i did request . only N out of the N ingredients was right . . but the time they do get it right , it ' s great paninis ! a big too expensive though . ( lost N star here ) 
takes cash only . very affordable place with a plethora of different types of hot dogs and cheese steaks to choose from . they also are the one of the few restaurants that sells " jarritos " which are delicious mexican sodas . i keep on telling myself that since it ' s all natural sugar it somehow makes it better for me . so far they sell them in pineapple , lime , fruit punch , mango , and grape fruit . now , before you go for the safe flavors i will tell you from personal experience that pineapple and grapefruit are easily the best flavors . the pineapple is tart and refreshing and the grapefruit . . . um it tastes nothing like grapefruit but has a very light citrusy flavor to it . as for hot dogs , d makes a really nice sauerkraut and mustard with chopped onions and peppers on top , i would also go with the jersey cheesesteak , and the chili dog . i just uploaded their menu so you can see for yourself . 
from the decor to food and service , the best in nyc ! 
found this hot spot on our way home from vacation with a quick stop for lunch through burlington . really liked this place . built my own salad which i absolutely love to do . ingredients were fresh delicious and the wifi is a bonus ! 
everything is good especially the sweet potato pancakes ( with homemade flavored butter ) along with turkey bacon and scrambled eggs . don ' t forget the hot chocolate with whipped cream . oh - the portion sizes are plenty so bring a big appetite
it was just okay . i had high hopes after seeing everyone talk up the fried chicken , but its not going to be a serious contender on my fried chicken list . the lamb was pretty good , as i ' d hope a nz restaurant would be , but i ' m not sure i really see myself going back . 
i love the fire place ! ! ! ! plus , awesome sausages , fries , big beer selection , jenga . . . this is just a great place to get together with your friends . the place is pretty big but it has a very cozy feeling to it . also , they have N bathrooms and N of them are assigned for women ! ! ! thank you ! i really like their chairs they are flexible so can squeeze bet tables . . . i though that was a very smart touch . 
i was happy to stumble upon this restaurant . walking by with so many choices around what stopped me from continuing my search was the ambiance and the outdoor seating . we waited fifteen minutes for a table at the bar where we enjoyed the first part of a bottle of wine . we sat on the outdoor terrace . a blonde waitress arrived at the table and asked " are you ready to order ? " . no " hello " or " good evening " no salutation , just " are you ready to order " . i said " hello , and how are you this evening and what ' s your name ? " . she then woke up . unfortunately the service was a zero . the bus boys were quietly efficient but were too quick to take away plates without asking if we were done or not . the food was great ! the brussel sprouts we had as a starter and were crispy and delicious . we shared the seabass , perfectly cooked and moist , and the italian salad was also perfectly dressed with fresh ingredients . we skipped dessert . ambiance N stars food N stars service zero
they serve gluten free pasta ! ! yay ! ! service was slow . boo ! nice atmosphere . yay ! ! had a hard time getting my water refilled . boo ! overall nice place . N out of N in our group enjoyed their meal . the Nth should have known better than to get some fancy cod stuffed ravioli . 
yikes . a restaurant must really be doing something wrong for me to give a N star rating . my friends and i decided to visit the pilgrim diner tonight to enjoy some food after watching a movie . however , we didn ' t end up enjoying anything . the pros well ouch , there ' s not much to say here . the man who brings out the water at the beginning of the meal is one of the lone bright spots of the experience . although we only saw him for about five seconds , he warmly greeted us and that is a plus . i would say the only reason this restaurant deserves the N star ( the restaurant itself doesn ' t deserve any ) is because of him . the cons oh boy . to start off , the decor is clearly outdated . the seats are falling apart , one of my friends spotted out a fly , and the ambiance was overall downright depressing . the ordering of food ended up being a complete mess . one of my friends ordered an omelet and ended up getting a salad ( thankfully they switched it ) . in the midst of that confusion , the waitress just put down my plate of food in the front of the table ( i ' m in the inner booth so i can ' t reach it from my position ) without handing it to me . furthermore , one of my other friends inquired about the chili when we first ordered and never received anything when the food came . he had to remind the waitress about the order ( it was clear that she forgot about it ) and ended up receiving the food once half our group finished eating already . i ordered the p . diddy wrap ( grilled chicken , egg , bacon , avocado ) and it was just really bland and forgettable . there were no redeeming qualities about the food that would warrant a visit back . the biggest issue of the night was the staff behind the cash register . clearly , the blonde haired woman working the cash register did not want to be there . when my friends and i approached the counter to pay off the check , i knew by her facial expressions that this would get ugly . being a party of N , i can understand that it can be frustrating to separate out the checks . however , this woman was aggressive and rude to us . the first thing she said in a harsh and rude manner after we asked if we could tell her what each of us got was , " you better just get your money and figure out the check for yourselves , i ' m not going to figure out the tax . " now my problem with this is N ) it was not like there was a line of people waiting to cash out their checks . it ' s N N pm . N ) the math isn ' t hard to figure out , you have a calculator right in front of you . N ) you didn ' t have to give us that attitude and be rude about it . listen , it ' s not my business if you don ' t like your job , just don ' t lash out your frustration on the customers . furthermore , there was an argument afterwards about the check on the cost of pita , since the check stated that my friends ordered extra . after an exchange of words between my friends and the woman , she ended up yelling loudly for the waitress to clarify the check . the dialogue included woman behind the cash register " did they have N orders of pita ? " waitress " they had N full orders of pita " woman behind the cash register " see , that ' s what i ' ve been trying to tell them . . " no . ladies and gentlemen , that is enough . final thoughts forgettable food , a lousy environment , and an aggressive woman behind the counter really ruined the experience . for the life of me , i cannot recommend this place to my friends or any other diner lover . is this place better during the day ? it ' s possible . will i come back to find out ? i wouldn ' t count on it . if you are looking for a nice diner experience , look elsewhere . you won ' t find it here . p . s . i believe this photo below pretty much sums up the experience we had at the pilgrim diner . 
i don ' t know queens at all , but a weekend visit was enough to make apparent that queens kickshaw is part of a strong and current wave of gentrification . the restaurant appeals to hip yuppies with a casual cafe bar setup and a handsome , minimalist aesthetic . also , it ' s a vegetarian brunch place with a good draft list . that only happens in a handful of liberal urban neighborhoods across the country . we arrived at eleven on a saturday with a party of five , and there was no wait for seats at a long communal table in back . it was comfortable enough , and service was good . i kicked off my brunch with a michelada , a red pepper beer bloody mary . it was spicy and satisfying . the food was tasty , simple , and reasonably priced . i had the N egg and cheese sandwich , which came with ricotta , cheese crisp , thyme , and maple hot sauce on brioche . it was small but filling , something i could eat often . it was also wonderfully flavorful , and i loved the texture and burnt cheese taste of the crisp . my husband ' s grilled cheese was also good , though he found it too skimpy for N . he got the cheddar and mozzarella on brioche with tomato soup , standard reliable childhood fare . i tend to prefer meat when it ' s available , but my sandwich was great and i ' d definitely come back to queens kickshaw if i lived in the area . the space was pleasant , perfect for an afternoon beer . astorians should all take advantage . 
my husband and i were both very disappointed with hapgoods . the interior is very charming , but also very loud because there is nothing to absorb the sound . so our hopes of having a nice , quiet breakfast were gone because not only is the restaurant loud but we were seated next to a table that had a very loud baby . it took a very long time to get our drinks ( coffee and iced tea ) following by a long wait for the breakfast which was at best mediocre . i don ' t know how this restaurant got N stars and higher . we will not be coming back . 
i have been to this restaurant more then once and i was never disappointed . the food is great and the service as well . we had the rib eye and shrimp which was great . also , surprisingly the vegetable dumplings were delicious ( although not too appealing as i have never tried green dumplings ) . and for dessert , you must try the green tea ice cream . it ' s creamy and has a strong kick to it , but all the more reason to love it ! 
the panini ' s here are fantastic , and the value isn ' t too bad either since the panini ' s are a decent size . some of the crostini were fantastic as well , others were " meh " . it ' s just a matter of finding what you like . other than the food nice atmosphere and great service with a fairly decent drinks selection . 
such a great place in a very casual environment . always busy . paninis are large enough to share ( and if you tell them that you are sharing , they will gladly put them on separate plates for you ) . the same goes for the soups . i love the meat and cheese dishes that are served with brilliantly toasted slices of bread ends drizzled in olive oil . who knew that bread ends would be my new favorite things ? the crepes are very good , but if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth , they have a frozen hot chocolate that they put an entire hershey ' s milk chocolate bar into . 
hands down , best deli in the area ! 
came for a late saturday afternoon brunch . they serve brunch until N N when they close and reopen for dinner at N . very unique , cutting edge brunch menu . it was hard to choose because there were so many things that looked interesting . we both started with the special pear ginger mimosas ( N ) . the fruity mimosa was effervescent and not too strong . went down fast . after going back and forth i ordered the intriguing bacon , egg and cheese sliders ( N ) . it was two tiny sliders with blue cheese , eggs and crispy pork belly served on a white castle type bun . the sliders themselves were tasty , but not very filling . the real hit were the sweet potato fries with smoked paprika aioli . they were awesome . i was still a little hungry so i went with the bacon doughnuts ( N ) served with a small scoop of coffee ice cream . nice presentation , but nothing outrageous . the munchkin size donuts had a few pieces of crunchy bacon sprinkled on top lying in a sticky syrup glaze . it was something different . my friend is jewish and she mentioned the word traif is yiddish meaning not kosher which is fitting because their menu is filled with bacon items . cool spot for brunch with fast , attentive service . heated outside seating and an open kitchen which gave my friend ample time to check out the chef who she had the hots for . . N . N stars . 
came twice before catching shows at the academy of music across the street . pre-theater menu ( N , N courses ) is a good deal if you were planning to get one of those entree items anyways appetizers are good-sized and can serve as entrees if you ' re not too hungry slow service pre-theater menu took us almost N hours to get through , and we had to rush them every N mins for the last half hour to make it even ordering off the regular menu , it still took them half an hour to bring our food out delicious bread hummus , but try not to fill up on it while waiting ( a ridiculously long time ) for your food really good fresh fish cooked in light sauces . my fav is the sea bass can easily accommodate large parties bathrooms are downstairs , with two side-by-side wooden doors to the women ' s men ' s . don ' t get confused , i saw it almost happen once for what it ' s worth , still a bit on the expensive side . N . N stars , rounding up . 
cafe habana seems to be in a battle with ippudo for the most ridiculously high number of reviews . the nerd in me would guess that with so many reviews , the confidence interval around cafe habana ' s published rating of N should be pretty narrow , and i think the yelpers got it spot on . a fun restaurant in a great location with pretty solid food ( but not groundbreaking - hence no N ) . the highlights for me were -the corn , which has been reviewed ad nauseum on these pages , so no need to go further into that -camarones al ajillo spicy and delicious -the cocktails - of which too many to name were consumed around the table on my visit ( sunday at Npm ) i was fortunate enough to be seated without a wait , but it does appear like this is the exception rather than the rule . i hope to have similar fortunes on my inevitable return visit ! 
i love carmines . we tend to do a lot of large- party birthday celebrations here a lot . family style food tends to make the bill overall less expensive , and encourages more interaction and fun . like most italian places , they also have delicious wine . the atmosphere is fun and family , so dont come here alone ! 
about a year ago , i organized a party there . it was very memorable . i loved the fun festive atmostphere , vibrant outdoor seats . i ' ve been there like N or N times since . crowd can get pretty outrageous , esp on weekends . one night i came they ran out of mojitos . i had to settle for their sangria , which turned out pretty aweful . as for the food , it ' s really like a N stars . just ok , nothing spectacular . the only thing that sticks out is their N corn . the food is def better at cafe habana , their sister restaurant in manhattan . i would give them N stars just for being the only eco-friendly restaurant in bk . i will continue to go there to meet friends but not when i ' m really hungry for some good food . good place to chill pre-party . 
this place was awesome ! get the spread sampler , every single one is amazing on pita . the greek fries were fantastic too . i ' m the biggest carb whore and these hit the spot . very nicely cheesed . we were also offered free dessert ! a light baklava-ish type of thing . . . so yummy . not too sweet . just right . i will be back , fast . 
room service is a solid four star place . cute decor , good food , excellent prices . definitely worth a try ! 
love this place . especially recommend the fried dumplings and the sesame pancak with peking duck . 
come for the adorable atmosphere . stay for the good cappuccino , seriously delicious homemade lemonade , refreshingly not-too-sweet chai lattes , and decent wifi connection . but mostly come for the atmosphere . 
came here for brunch . yummy and charming . the decor is so warm and inviting . they have an open kitchen so you get to see the cooks move around in the kitchen when they get your order . we came somewhat early so there weren ' t that many people around , the service was nice because they kind of left you alone which i really like , however others may take that as not being attentive . liked it very much , great decor , cozy , would recommend to a friend . 
nice selection , great service and tasty food . can ' t complain ! chorizo anything rocks . i can ' t wait to go back again ! 
if your expecting anything special except over priced wanna be microwaved cajun food . . . then keep waking . we told the waitress that the crawfish macaroni and cheese had two pieces of crawfish and was extremely dry and uneditibe . . . she brought the check back and said . . . sorry the macaroni and cheese was not to your liking . . . that ' s it ! unreal . . we will never visit this place again . we ordered an appetizer of deviled eggs . . they brought us N extra small eggs with a imitation crab on it for N dollars . and the so called fried seafood platter had popcorn shrimp , a few clams and one soggy piece of catfish for N dollars ! way over priced and horrible horrible food . don ' t waste your money . hi michelle . . i appreciate your comment , however , i have no reason or no time to sit here and write " fake reviews " we were in your restaurant on sunday the Nth in the late afternoon , we did sit at the first table in the front , we did order your seafood platter mac and cheese with a sweet tea and one beer . . we also payed in cash . . check your receipts again , along with your food . quit trying to cover up bad service and bad food , it just looks really bad . 
i ' d been dying to check this place out , ever since i first read about it around two months ago . i ' m very much disgusted by the corporate , industrial production of all the different animal meats in this good ole u . s . of a . , and very eager to support independent , local , and sustainable farming . ( check out the meat racket the secret takeover of america ' s food business , by cristopher leonard , published by simon and schuster . ) i ' ve no doubt that butcher bar ' s food source , as they claim , is anything but small scale , sustainable , local , humanely raised , and high quality . but the taste ? that ' s altogether another topic for discussion . what i would say to the good folks who are preparing this wholesome food is please , can you go just a little bit lighter on the salt and sugar ? the baked beans tasted , to me , like granulated cane sugar ( and not much else ) , while the pork belly was way too salty . rather than licking my fingers and salivating for more , i struggled to finish them , and ultimately could not . the sauce was on the sweet side , and apparently the only one available , as no options were offered . the pulled pork was over-sauced , over spiced , and also too sweet for my taste . the ribs were good , and the corn ( cakes ? ) were ok , not overly sweet , ( a pleasant surprise ) . if anything was lacking , ironically , i would say it was the smoke . when you have such wholesome , high quality cuts of a sustainable meat product , layered with a good amount of fat , and you add smoke to that , why on earth would anyone want to go and ruin it with a ton of salt and sugar ? it makes me wonder if the cooks and or chefs at this place ever taste the food they ' re preparing before they serve it . i agree with sarah s . on the corn " cakes " . alailnicky z . hit the nail on the head regarding porky ' s platter . but i also agree with christina v . regarding butcher bar ' s potential , so i ' ll give ' em three stars , and another chance . 
tacos don memo is a great good truck located between N - Nth market street in the university city area . i ' ve eaten there chicken burritos and have tried their tacos carnitas . delicious ! ! so very tasty and filling . burritos are my favorite and are filled with fresh cilantro , avocado , and your choice of meat , cheese . you can easily share this burrito as i ' ve done and be pleasantly filled . worth the trip ! 
after the meal i had there this afternoon , i ' ve fallen in love with de mole . my mom and i took a trip out to sunnyside for our first saturday lunch date of N . the restaurant is small , but they ' ve done a lot with the little space they have . i think they succeeded in making it very modern , and cozy . we were seated promptly , and started looking over the menu . we ordered the guacamole , since the majority of people who ' ve yelped it have said not to pass it up . and they were right ! it was full of cilantro and diced tomato , and the chips were on point as well . great start to our meal . we also ordered the scallop ceviche . it should be noted that the scallops are diced , not whole . when it first came , i found myself poking at it with my fork , expecting to find whole scallops underneath . still , the scallops were extremely fresh and i really enjoyed my first taste of mexican ceviche . i ' ve never had ceviche with bits of avocado in it , and my mom and i devoured it . i must say that both appetizers get extra props for their very attractive presentation . after all , you eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth . i considered ordering the enchiladas verde con pollo , especially when i saw others around me digging into their own orders . but , i came to try the mole and thought i should stick to that and order what the restaurant is known for . it is their namesake after all . i ordered the skirt steak mole , a special . it arrived looking just as it did in the photos posted on yelp . and it was amazing . i don ' t think i spoke more than a few words while i ate because i was too busy stuffing my face with the perfectly prepared steak and delicious mole sauce . even after we ' d left , and i was walking to the subway , i was driving my mom crazy repeating " i really enjoyed my mole ! " . we ended off our meal by sharing the tres leches . it tasted like it was flavored with liqueur and topped with bananas and whipped cream . sweet way to end off an awesome meal . if i owned a restaurant , i ' d want it to be like de mole ---- intimate and cozy , and serving up delicious and beautifully presented food that brightens the spirits , fills the tummy and is easy on the wallet . 
i enjoyed my meal . i think that it is a bit pricy for the sandwich . unfortunately , there is no restroom , yike . the cashier was not too friendly . i agree with some people that the lemonade is a bit sour . the cider is delicious . i had a makareal and my partner had a pot belly which was tastier than mine . 
first of all , i love this place and i always go there . second of all , the stairs leading to the bathroom is very slippery . what the f ! you guys don ' t keep it nice and dry . my mom slipped and fell . she hurt and bruised her entire back because of the slippery stairs . you should be happy that you ' re not getting sued . 
how can i be first to review this place ? ? ! ? ! ? ! another family favorite -- used to come here with the grandparents , who also converted my dad into a fan ( even after my parents divorced , my dad and stepmom would go there , run into my grandparents and wind up having dinner altogether . dysfunctional families , unite ! ) their fried chicken is awesome -- they bill it as " honey dipped " , but it doesn ' t taste sweet -- i think the honey just makes the batter crispier . the prime rib is also great -- always cooked perfectly , not overly salty or tough . another little thing is the cinnamon apples they serve as a side -- i can ' t explain it , but they are maybe baked and so tasty ! ! i ' ve had almost everything on the menu at this point , and i can ' t think of one thing that wasn ' t good . freddie ' s is also great for larger groups -- a few years back my dad decided to take the whole family there for christmas -- a total of N people -- and the staff was so accomodating and nice , even though we felt like a big group of loud noisy jerks ( cause we are , i guess ) . 
pork sandwiches is recommended . price saved me from giving it a N star . it was way to greasy for me , i had to drench it in sascha sauce which totally killed the actual flavor . 
our meals were horrible , took way too long and were cold when we got them , and worst of all , the manager was an olympic gold-medaling asshole when i confronted him about our meals . i will never go back to hook ladder . the one bright spot was our very nice waitress gretchen . 
before i get into the restaurants problems , i ' ll say this the burger is the best i ' ve ever had , without question . i ' m not usually a gourmet burger person , but this is the real deal . otherwise though what an overpriced and dissapointing meal . the worst part was the wine - N for junk basically . if you want to be taken seriously as a restaurant , why is it so hard to have good wine at all price points ? if i ever go back , which i doubt , i think i ' d have to spend N to get something drinkable . not fun . 
blossom asian bistro has great atmosphere that ' s reminiscent of nyc restaurants . but without the cramped seating . the dressing on the side salads , which come with most entrees , are delicious ! and their water is of high quality . put a lemon in it ! i know these seem like silly things , but it ' s the small parts that make up the whole . i ' ve eaten there plenty of times as blossom asian bistro is pretty much a byword for great food . 
great food . vast selection of sake . 
i just had to try these infamous macarons ! they ' re about the size of a silver dollar and will set you back three times that , each . N . N a pop to be exact . i ordered the strawberry marshmallow , caramel with salt , chocolate and rose petal . they all sounded so delicious and looked so pretty it was hard to narrow it down . my favorites were the strawberry marshmallow and caramel . i tried to make it last by taking mini-bites of each , but these can easily be devoured in one or two normal bites . but what they lack in size , they easily make up for in flavor . each was bursting with their namesake , so it was easy to tell which was which if they were similar in color . we went on a friday around N Npm and there was very little wait about N minutes . the service is fast and extremely nice . i ' ll be back to try the pistachio since i forgot about that one . 
went to pietro ' s for girls night out a while back and it was wonderful ! i personally had the penne pasta with vodka sauce and it was so good ! i ' d recommend it to any of my friends . the presentation of the food was nice and our waiter was very helpful . i ' d go back to pietro ' s in a heartbeat ! 
seriously one of the best hole-in-the-wall ramen places in nyc . it ' s away from the hustle and bustle of st marks place , but still retains a busy dinner crowd in its tiny east village spot . the pork gyozas are fantastic appetizers , seared perfectly so that they ' re not charred and not too greasy . i ' ve tried several variations of the ramen and they ' ve all been superb . service is great too . 
no way no way no way ! ! ! ! i ' ve experienced much better place than this , yes sushi is fine but so is other places , yes is all you can eat sushi but so is other places . services is terrible and not nice . 
sushi yasuda is the place to go . its sashimi is to die for . they even have a house-made soy sauce . the combo pre-fixe menu is how to go in this place . i was really impressed . 
hard to remember what i even got but all i remember was we ordered too much ! haha . my cousin and i split N sandwiches thinking they were small . . . don ' t be fooled by their size nor price ! it ' s bread , people ! and that will get you full . and also those prices too add up so having like N sandwiches could be like N- N easy . get the sangria , that was delicious . i ' m a big baby when i drink ( as in the less alcohol i taste , the better ) and this was awesome . . how much alcohol was actually in there ? probably not a lot but still tasted so good . their bread is awesome- toasty but soft . and their dessert sandwiches are also a must get . i can ' t remember the exact name of it but it was chocolate bread with nutella and other good stuff . even though i was stuffed , i still had to try it- and it was well worth it . came on a sunday afternoon when it opened . we were the first ones there but around N N , it started getting busy . the people working there are super nice . why the minus one star ? i didn ' t think it was the best sandwiches around . . while it ' s really unique and cool getting different tiny sandwiches , it didn ' t blow my mind- but nonetheless , still pretty darn good sandwiches . 
traif . meaning unkosher ( as ingrained by the server upon seating . ) preface there is nothing " unkosher " about traif ( in the grand sense of the word . ) firstly , the food is alarming delicious . superb product choices and a marrying flavors in ways that affordable food in this city has yet to reproduce . ( primarily the sweetbread shrimp special and the pork belly artichoke starter ) but the service consists of a poor script , painstakingly devised and enforced by a gestapo management . " welcome , have you been to traif before ? ( no , you just opened ) you must sample our delicious . . . " intrusive and poorly rehearsed at that . a reading from the torah has more original appeal . secondly , the decor is anything but traif . you are surrounded and consumed by an extremely kosher upchuck of tried and ( not so true ) ikea concept design . shot glasses filled with pottery barn pebbles ' decorate ' the bathroom alongside a receptacle ' aptly ' labeled a sanitary disposal via a label gun sticker . not to mention the urban outfitters ' decals on the wall which exude a not so thoroughly devised aesthetic for an over-saturated williamsburg restaurant scene . i pity the talented chef ( formerly of the limited la fine dining scene ) that must find a way to coexist within this environment . the disconnect could be its inevitable demise . if you can ignore your remaining three senses , the taste ( and smell ) of this chef ' s approachable cuisine is worth the trek . -a p-heights resident ( still without williamsburg-envy . ) 
trying something new today . taste of summer whole wheat pancakes with fresh strawberries , raspberries and walnuts . . . . awesome . and huevos rancheros to die for ! ! ! i mean they ate really , really great ! try them for yourself and you will see ! and . . . . . don ' t forget to have a cappuccino ! they are so good ! ! ! ! 
this was my first time coming here . went here during lunch time on a friday so it wasn ' t packed at all . our server was very kind and helpful . i was craving the papita de rellenas since that ' s a cuban staple food and we also ordered pernil with tostones . as i was digging into the papita de rellanas . i hit the center and it was ice cold ! ! ( i told the server immediately and he said he would bring fresh ones . they came back and they were still ice cold in the center . at this point i was done with my meal and didn ' t even bother letting the server know . it made me doubt there freshness of food by making that same mistake twice . also i ordered the churasco . i got it medium well and it wasn ' t as tender as it should be . i was definitely disappointed since i was looking forward to coming to this place for a long time . wasn ' t worth a N lunch whatsoever . 
i really hate to say this because i ' m a huge fan of collichio ' s . but riverpark was totally underwhelming . the food was utterly bland , predictable , and boring . granted , i ate there before their " official opening " so maybe they ' re still sharpening their menu up , but i won ' t be returning any time soon . 
ok , port richmond fries ! - french fries with sauer kraut , fried onions , kielbasa , cheese , and sour cream . outstanding ! very friendly place and they have a variety of microbrews and great dining options . 
this is my favorite place to go for pho in south philly . it ' s a nice , clean restaurant with quick service . food their spring rolls are good . my bf and i both ordered a large pho tai . . . i believe its N on the menu . vegetables are fresh , noodle and meat ratio are good , and the broth is very tasty without adding any sauces into it . i love their fruit shakes since they use real fruit ! avocado smoothie all the way ! mango is pretty good as well . i haven ' t tried any of their other kinds yet but definitely will the next time i go back . service quick . you order , they give your food , and pay at the register whenever your done eating . cost about N-N person . 
best mojito i have ever had ! so delicious . the food is great too , although i remember just have a small side dish since i was more interested in the booze ( and was a poor college student ) . 
my lunch was N and it was damn good . i read some mixed reviews about thai palace but went with my gut and they did not disappoint . i had the drunken noodles with chicken and that was plenty of food but you also get a choice of soup and a couple of small egg rolls and pineapple chunks for dessert for . . . . N . service was friendly and efficient . all in all , a very positive experience and one i ' ll be repeating . 
i ' m always here yet i never review . i ' m so terrible . i love nam phuong ! there are so many food items that i could write about but i guess i ' ll just start with my most recent meal . - bo luc lac yummy ! one of those dishes that i order almost every single time i ' m there . -ground shrimp - sugarcane w rice paper a great starter ! it ' s just so so tasty . -pho tai it was decent , but not something i would think to order here . my friend wanted it so i decided to give it a try . come here if you want cheap authentic viet food . until next time . . . 
had dinner there last night and was most impressed . in the early fall and spring this place would be great as it ' s an open air restaurant sitting on the park . while very small , the staff was friendly and the place had an intimate feel . the crowd was in their N ' s to N ' s so it ' s not a place where you ' re going to find a bunch of kids slamming down beers . i had the cheese plate followed by a burger which apparently they are known for and both were great . 
reviewers of this restaurant sure seem to have an over abundance of confidence in their food writing skills--writing skills in general . the " want crab croquette now " review was the most informative , helpful and had the least implication of overwhelming sense of entitlement and importance of any of the reviews here . rye restaurant reviewers on yelp here ' s a hint don ' t make your writing try to read like the mostly crappy food writing in the nytimes . ( amanda hesser remains an idiot and bruni and sifton aren ' t werent much better . ) to you that newspaper may define the world , now get over that attitude , and learn to write about what you like or dislike and avoid adjectives like " comfortable " or " charming " --the list goes on . the noun " atmosphere " is a stupid choice too , and if you can ' t figure out why , stop writing and spare us . ( anybody else here think it completely unacceptable for yelp to ask for your registration email ' s password--just what i want , yelp to know how to read my emails from glen beck thanking me for my support . ) yelp also runs a lot of java script in my browser--wtf . let ' s see if this review of the reviewers and yelp gets posted . have a drink at the bar , i hear it has a good jack rose ( sort of an orange margarita my mother introduced me to more than N years ago , and more than N years ago my father introduced me to wild turkey rye . ) 
been here serveral times since it opened and changed chef pizza master . pizza is up there with the best in the city . very casual atmosphere , great wines and the cheese board was great . i also like the antipasti roasted veggies . 
i really love this place , its a comfortly small bar . the wide selection of local beer is really impressive . it is really hard to find a good place to eat and get a beer in west philly . the owners are very nice and make you feel like you are walking into their house . the only downside of the place is that when there are a lot of people the place can get very loud . 
i went to the rose petal cafe about N weeks ago , the atmosphere was great it was crowded and smelled delicious ! we got seated at the windows it was a lazy sunday morning , late . . . i would say just before noon . although it was very busy it didn ' t take long to get seated but it was a minute before we got served . the waitress was very nice and very professional when she took our orders . i would say its a kool place to go sit and eat and talk when you have time but if your trying to get in and out . . . that ' s not gonna ' work . the truth is i didn ' t really mind the wait bcoz the vibe of the place was so laid back . the food was good . . . french toast , bacon and eggs . i felt like i ate N meals ! lol . . . it ' s very generous portions and i ' m glad i had some walking and shopping to do after bcoz i felt so guilty ! i didn ' t eat again until dinner lol . i love this place for my sunday mornings but i ' m def gonna try another day of the week ) and i wanna try the crab cakes next time . . . someone had them at the next table and they looked and smelled amazing ! 
stopped in with a friend- she had the chicken waffles and i decided to try one of their specialty sandwiches the turkey bacon - yumm ! i couldn ' t help but try some of her waffle and it was probably one of the best waffles i ' ve ever had . my sandwich was spot on - the chipotle sauce definitely made it . i would definitely come back - their prices are more than reasonable , staff is nice and the overall d cor is chill 
we went to the cookshop this sunday to celebrate a big birthday for my husband . we were a party of N , and the waitress was outstanding ! ( i wish i had gotten her name , so that i could give her a shout-out here . ) the food was fantastic from the appetizers to the entrees to the desserts . we were treated like royalty the whole time even though they didn ' t know it was a special occasion until we left . we had to wait just a bit for our main course , but we were busy in conversation and really weren ' t upset about it , but our waitress apologized profusely and made up for it in spades . i highly recommend the cookshop for a special occasion or any occasion . 
go to zafra and enjoy some delicious beverages as well as some well executed cuban inspired dishes . the staff was super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu . thanks to the floor staff and kitchen for a great night . btw if your not in the mood for a whole meal just stop the bar and let ed take great care of you . 
absolutely loved this place . authentic mexican for cheap . service is exactly what it should be , but the tacos are just awesome . not much else to say . drinks were delicious as well . if you like tacos , are in nyc , and can get here , do it . 
best sushi in princeton . difficult to get a table on busy nights . love the " guest rules " on the menu . that ' s right if you don ' t like it , go somewhere else . prices are up this year . try the spider roll , pure perfection . 
el camino gets N stars because this site will not let me give it N . although i have no tattoos , piercings or ability to wear skinny jeans , i love this trendy hippy place . the food is consistent and fantastic . 
family oriented and kid friendly ! wonderful lunch buffet with a huge healthier selection for the lunch on the go . 
funky place with a great fish taco and awesome guacamole
N stars . Nth oldest tavern in nyc ( irish bar ) . ordered a burger which was ok . 
good quiet spot for some home cooked polish food . truly authentic
coconut cream latte . chilequiles . everything here is delicious and thoughtfully presented . the coffee is fantastic , with skulls designed into the foam , the brunch - eggs sides sauces are superb . they really nailed every detail here and i am already dying to go back and take friends . 
i went to day by day for lunch not too long ago , but might have caught them at a bad time . due to " high-volume catering , " they could not serve any of their hot entrees . apparently they do a lot of catering in the city , but the fact that the menu is subject to be so different on any given day is indeed a turnoff . the food itself was just ok . i got a smoked salmon sandwich , and my friend got a chicken salad sandwich . nothing to write home about . except , actually , for their cream of broccoli soup , which was pretty delicious . we ( two of us ) dropped about N on lunch -- and for a couple of cups of soup , and two sandwiches , that is high even for rittenhouse standards . 
was recently back in philly visiting the in-laws and determined to find an alternative to marra ' s ( which i adore by the way ) . how great was it to be squeezed in last minute for a table of N on a saturday evening ? pretty friggin awesome actually . i loved l ' angelo from the sec we walked in and past the kitchen . our entrees were stellar , the service was attentive and appropriate to a joint in the hood and the prices were so fair . but . . . the appetizers were a bit overpriced and stingy when being shared by N peeps . a slight reduction in price or a slight increase in portion would not kill them . the shrimp in the grilled asparagus prosciutto shrimp appetizer was pretty tough and the portion was far too meager but very very tasty nonetheless . the moral of the story is get an easier to find and read on-line menu tweak the prices and portions of the appetizers and i will love you all forever . a great place in a great hood in a great city . 
such an awesome place in nyc - the new yorkers are spoiled to have this gem in their midst ! we got in and the place was mobbed - people everywhere - shopping , scouting for a seat at one of the mini restaurants or bars , drinking . . . just people everywhere . the market areas - they have a large cheese and charcuterie section , produce , fresh pasta , bread , dessert . . . everything and it is just like mario batali - legit ! we managed to get a seat at one of the bars and ordered the cheese and charcuterie plate ( and wine if course ) and it was amazing . the fresh made ricotta was outstanding - so outstanding that i looked up the recipe and plan to make it and pair it with honey and almonds - just how it was there . stop in and check this place out - it makes you want to move to italy . . . or eataly . - ) 
this place is great ! i went with my mom and sister and we loved it . we ordered the spicy tuna roll , cucumber and eel roll and the cy-tuna roll with edamame to start . the waitress hostess was very friendly and attentive and our order came out quickly . the prices are reasonable too . i loved this place and will definitely be back ! 
the worst part is usually the wait . been here three times and enjoyed them all , twice for brunch . the fried chicken is really good , a little greasy but fresh , hot and crunchy . the biscuits arte the best ever . everyone should make them like this . i get a biscuit with sausage gravy and egg for brunch , i think it is called bob evans ? i call it deliscious . i keep going back to the banana cream pie for dessert . i love it . whenever i stray i am not as impressed . have tried chocolate , coconut and the donuts . nope , banana cream please . 
ilili has an amazing happy hour . im impressed by their coctail selection and the space where the happy hour happens is great . although i came here for dinner and not the happy hour with a huge group of girls . ive never really had lebanese food so i was terribly excited . their menu was interesting . lots of unusual things . i tried to order the moussaka bc i thought that it was the same middle eastern one that im used to eating . . but alas , it was cold and did not have meat . no can do . so i opted for the fun stuff ont he menu like the chicken liver , sweet breads , and their popular item which was the katayef . the chicken liver was delicious . . . it was cooked correctly and was really flavorful . the sweetbreads were ok nothing to write home about . but the katayef ! heaven ! ! ! it was this nice and fluffy pancake filled with magical goodness ! ! ! well , veal and veggies and sauce . lol . it certainly has to be their best seller . i also tried their tabbouleh . it was fresh and summery and light . their sardines were also very good . salty in a good way of course . . but so very fresh . service was great , although they did mess up our bill twice . but the manager actually personally apoligized to us which was very nice . i defintely had a nice time here and had fun trying out their unusual cuisine . i serioulsy coming back for happy hour ! 
one of my college professors flew into town for the day and wanted to meet for dinner on short notice . she wanted authentic thai food because she rarely gets to enjoy thai food near the outskirts of illinois where she flew in from . so i went on the hunt to find a great thai restaurant and i came across this place . choosing this place was the biggest mistake ever ! ! ! ! ! although the outside patio is a nice feature and comfy . . . the food was horrible and the lemonade tasted like it came from an old can ! ! i was so embarrassed that as a native nyer i took my professor to this restaurant . the service was ok but i will never step foot in here again ! 
a friend and i ordered takeout , and somehow , miraculously , all the food showed up absolutely perfect and amazingly delicious . . . watching the piano teacher , and too damn lazy to go outside in the snow , the perfect solution was pio pio ( slightly americanized but still authentic peruvian food ) . . . ordering over the phone was a bit of an ordeal , i had to repeat myself a few times , i was put on hold a few times , and then i had to repeat myself a few more times -- the whole process literally took N minutes ( almost as long as the delivery itself took ! ) but it was definitely worth the wait . . . we ordered way too much food , and ate way too much of it . . . the parihuela ( soup ) was wondeful , just the right amount of spice , not at all oily , and lots of really good seafood -- clams , mussels , calamari , octopus , shrimp , scallops -- i don ' t know how they did it but the soup came piping hot yet nothing was overcooked . . . the jalea totally caught me off guard , nowhere in the menu product description does it say fried , but indeed fried it was -- light crispy batter ( even after delivery ! ) , very generous quality cuts of seafood , and the portion was huge ( the large could easily , by itself , be enough for N people ) -- i think the onions lime tomato sauce on the side was just a little bit too salty . . . and , best of all ( for me , at least ) , the whole chicken pio was super delicious , succulent and tender -- i can ' t get enough of the accompanying sauce . . . and there ' s enough leftover for another two-person meal . . . i used to live just an avenue away from this place , and for some reason it ' s taken me N years to actually eat here ( although i ' ve been to the upper east side location a couple times and the jackson heights location once ) -- though i ' ve yet to actually eat inside the restaurant . . . usually i wouldn ' t write a review based on only one experience , especially not a delivery , but i was wowed . 
omg ! ! ! the absolutely best sushi , i have ever had ! i had the lebanon roll . . . . so good , i would definitely recomend that to anyone . tried a bite of the farmer ' s stir fry , the sauce was fantastic and the portion size was huge . also tried the sides they brought out for us and they were very good . tried a bite of another dish , it was deep fried chicken in a spicy sauce , it was amazing ! staff kept coming over to check on us , which was very nice . when you see the place , you might think " this place is a dive " , but the experience and the food are worth it . the food is what i consider to be reasonably priced . will definitely go back again ! 
after reading several negative reviews , i thought this place needed a positive one . i originally came to mediterranea on a date and i was in awe . i ' ve been to many countries in europe and this place made me feel like i was back there . i thought the outside seating area was so romantic and intimate , along with the music . i ended up going back a couple days later with a bunch of my friends . the service both times was not the best , yet i ' ve dealt with worse . the prices are not that high , yet not that low either . the dishes i tried between the N visits consisted of hummus , greek salad , mediterranea salad , and falafel . they were good ! i loved the hookah flavors they had which had a very interesting variety . my favorite is the mango guava one . montclair needs more places like this . the atmosphere , hookah , byob , and music are all great qualities that i rarely find in town . it ' s a great place to chill with friends or have a romantic night ( if you like the middle eastern hookah scene ) . 
finally a normal market place in manhattan . 
the menu had me at wow . my dish , not so much . we walked in on a saturday at N p . m . and there was no wait for two people . even with all the ny tour groups walking by and the euro tourists stalking the greenwich area . gluten free breadsticks . . . . very good . crispy , puffy , cheesy . our waitress hooked us up with extra breadsticks . chicken , porcini , pine nut risotto - N stars . this is what i ordered . not so wow . the rice consistency was perfect , with generous servings of chicken , porcini mushrooms and a heap of pine nuts on top , but something was lacking . enough salt ? yes . freshly grated parmesan on top ? yes . all that and it still lacked flavor . i think it was the chicken . if they would ' ve marinated or cooked the chicken with some seasoning , it would ' ve given the dish flavor . instead , it tasted like plain , lightly salted white breast meat mixed in with mushrooms , pine nuts and rice . i sat there wishing i had gone with my gut reaction of wanting to order the porcini , sweet corn , and white truffle oil risotto . someone please tell me how that tastes so that i can torture myself further . sausage portabello risotto - N stars . my friend got this and i only had a taste . huge difference . it had flavor . much more bite inducing than my dish . the sausage takes well with the chicken broth carnaroli . the restaurant is bright , clean , and only seats about N people . they do have a wine list by the glass and bottle . if i lived in nyc , i would give this place another try , i just would shy away from the chicken risoottos , go with something heartier . 
best italian restaurant in new haven . . . . close call with tre scalini though . 
this great nuevo latino joint is one that i will remember and keep under my belt forever . besides the impeccable food , on sundays they have a serve yourself sangria bar , with the most natural and homemade sangria i have ever had . no waiting for waitresses or waiters , you want a refill , you just go up and get it . great way to start your sunday with a little buzz and a full stomach . 
i love the new location ! this is exactly what this restaurant needed . the place has plenty of room , very nice and the staff are friendly . i love the fact that most items have pictures so it really helps you decide on what to order . i do believe they have the best pork soup dumpling . the dumpling is perfectly cooked , it doesn ' t rip open once you pick it up and just the right amount of soup . the prices are great and i cannot wait to do more dim sum , here ! i ' m looking forward to one of my dim sum weekends with a bunch of friends and just ordering anything and everything we want to try . just remember to bring cash ! 
i ordered N sandwiches just to try and shared them with a friend . we ordered a falafel and a chicken shawarma , and let me tell you , my teeth are hurting from all that acidity they both had . it seemed as if both sandwiches were soaked in vinegar . i have never tried a falafel that had such a sour taste to it . whatever it was , never again falafel hut . the place it self is small cozy place , and the people are friendly , but the food , no no ! 
loud room slow service . turn of the century vibe packed with bearded boys bespeckled girls . overpriced cocktails . great food - reasonable and fresh . stereotypical williamsburg . 
i went here with a couple good friends to celebrate a couple of things-- my admission to grad school in manhattan , along with my roommate ' s new internship on wall street . we originally planned to go to parc or rouge , but having just been to rouge earlier that week , we instead decided to revisit alma de cuba , where we hadn ' t been in over a year . first impressions the decor is very nice , it ' s standard fare for starr restaurant group to incorporate good design that combines modern american sensibilities with whatever culture or mood the place is intended to capture , in this case it ' s cuba ( durrr ! ) . the crowd is mostly adults and young professionals , there ' s an energy to the place , but by no means does it feel like young energy . . . it ' s more like bachelorette party dinner energy , or meet up with your old pals from your last job energy . we went here a couple years back to meet a few girls our age , and it felt a little more energetic then than it does now . the seating not sure if we got lucky , as the three story restaurant had a N-minute wait , along with every other place in the area , but we were allowed to sit at what is usually a table for drinks and hors-d ' vores , and have our dinner there . . . which was fine , the table wasn ' t the roomiest , but it would certainly be accommodating . we also got to skip the line , i guess . the drinks we come to alma for one drink and one drink only the mojito . i was hooked on alma ' s mojito since N , for the excellent mix of mint throughout the drink , as well as a nice , thick stalk of sugar cane to chew on . disappointingly , both of these things i liked were not present in equal measure when i went recently , but it still tasted excellent . the food we got a sampler of three kinds of ceviche-- rainbow , yellowtail , and lobster . my favorite was the lobster , it ' s going to be something ceviche-lovers will really enjoy . it was definitely fitting as a light appetizer for three . for my entree , i had the crispy pork , which was a heavenly combination of tastes and textures . i am developing a real weak spot for certain cuts and preps for pork , and even though my stomach felt it a bit the next morning , it was worth it . combined with the rice and beans , this humble ethnic dish goes from simple to sabroso with ease . i also tried the mini taco appetizers my friends both ordered after the ceviche , very good as well . the pricing service the pricing is as starr group as the food and the ambiance it ' s arguably justifiable for the taste and experience . our waitress seemed to be pretty freaked out at the prospect of getting yelled at if she served us where we were sitting , but once that was worked out , she was great . we were able to eat at a pretty relaxed pace , without waiting forever to get moving once we were ready to hit the town . the bottom line i ' d give alma N-stars without a doubt if the year was N , but i just can ' t help but feel like things have gotten slightly stagnant , some aspects of the dining experience feel unchanged from three years ago , other things , like the craftsmanship i used to appreciate in their mojito felt lacking . simple things that could either have been subjective or that can be easily improved . definitely a good place with an atmosphere , worth trying out or revisiting regularly . 
just an awesome slice of your " not-so-nyc- typical-slice " of pizza . the artichoke pizza is intense , and if you are not ready for it , the flavor will knock your taste buds into the next millennium ! the crust is thick with a solid crunch , the sauce is ever-so creamy , and the cheese is aplenty ! you can only really eat just one slice before you od on the artichoke and spinachy goodness , so eating more is not recommended ! the crab slice is also an interesting find , however , it lies second to the main attraction and the more-than-often forgotten stepchild to the artichoke and spinach slice . if you haven ' t been infected by the gooey yumminess of the artichoke slice , try the crab slice first , go home , recover , and come back the next day for the artichoke . a great find ! 
i have eaten breakfast at the country girl diner twice now and only wish that i lived closer ! it is a taste of heaven , a friendly , efficient heaven at that . the french toast is fluffy and comes with as much real maple syryp and butter as a girl can stand , the bacon is thick cut and delicious and the portions are very generous . too bad because i was too happy and too stuffed to try anything more . next time ! 
had really bad food for lunch once - turkey sandwich , dry bread , dry turkey slooooow service , decided to give it another try for breakfast with two other people . we were disgusted . service was horribly slow even though there was only one other table of people ( now i know why ) and when the food came it was not good ! i dont know how you screw up breakfast but they managed . bland overcooked no flavor . i guess its just a bar place and you shouldnt try to eat there
great atmosphere . . . quaint style . . . awesome thin crust pizza ! have had the ceasars salad from delivery to my work place . . very good ( fresh ) . over all enjoyable experience and will bring friends back ! ! 
seabra ' s marisqueira is a portuguese restaurant that has character . every time i go , the food is consistently well cooked , well priced and very good . traditional portuguese cooking and steaks and seafood are cooked to perfection . it ' s a type of place where their own would be seen eating , if something doesn ' t come out right , words are said , corrections made . the servers are a little older but . . . . sorry to say the portuguese ( mostly older generation ) may be teensy bit ornery but so would anyone if you are undecided and fluctuate back and forth with indecision , if there is anything you don ' t about the menu or food , ask . the knowledgeable servers work hard and i ' m always amazed at the tiny kitchen fulfilling several orders in a timely manner . you hear sizzling food as the cooks are cooking , chopping of the knives as they prepare food , the guys work and the plates that come out , makes you want to sneak a piece as the servers deliver to the guests . . . if you are asking if i would recommend this restaurant . . . N yes ! 
one of the best brunch spots in williamsburg , for sure . i went on a saturday morning afternoon and didn ' t have to wait too long for a table . i got the veggie egg white omelet with goat cheese . . . . to die for ! but honestly , the best part of our meal with the bloody mary with two jumbo shrimp and a pickled green bean . 
purbird--where the lady behind the counter will gladly tell you that she won ' t put your order in because it ' s too much to eat for one person--and you should listen to her even though you think you can down it all . if it ' s your first time and you ' re hungry , get the grilled chicken with the sauces . i liked the purbird sauce , zucchini and chutney . if you ' re not as hungry , get the chicken breast sammich . both of these choices , with a side of jalapeno mash . . . . . it ' ll haunt you in your sleep . i wasn ' t a big fan of the whole wheat mac and cheese . . . something about whole wheat in my cheesy greasy goodness just doesn ' t seem right . also wasn ' t a big fan of the chicken burger--it was good , but the patty absorbed too much grease , which over powered everything else in the burger . 
thank you yelp for helping me discover my new favorite restaurant . nook is just great ! the tuna tartar appetizer , the fillet migno were both out of this world , but the peanut butter pie was definitely the deal sealer as my boyfriend would say . i wonder how much it would come out to to just rent a table ? 
skip this place . if you want good meat , find a real steakhouse . the quality of all the meats i tried were sub par except for the lamb and rib-eye . the thing that really killed me was the lack of a beer selection . philadelphia is a beer town . craft brews are at every other restaurant i ' ve been to except this one that only offers american rice beers and N ( one ! ) brazilian beer . so to sum it up N . mediocre food N . horrible beer selection N . louder than the electric factory
true class . patience required and rewarded . beware yelp and others including the restaurant ' s website ( which is not maintained by the demarcos ) have the wrong operating hours posted . doors are locked and last order is at Npm . 
simply the best . period . 
i have always been skeptical of this place , but am so glad that i had finally decided to give this place a try . i am a ho fun noodle soup gal and boy their beef stew noodle soup was the bomb ! the noodle was thick and soft . the broth was omg delicious . the beef was so tender . i ask for no bean sprouts . i finished my whole bowl and couldn ' t move or breathe . their special duck was pretty amazing too ! 
what a dump ! ! badly managed , crazy prices and just a matter of time before someone falls off that roof , thats if they dont freeze to death first . . . . oh and the drugs being sold there ( that we don ' t know about ) well that ' s a different story . . . lets see if the keystone cops can figure that one out . . thats if they havent been paid off
the wait here is a little ridiculous but well worth it . breakfast all day crispy pulled pork hash with a fried egg on top , comes with whyareyousoamazing portugese toast and N sides . completely satisfying and a lot more filling than it looks . dino poutine beef gravy on pulled pork on fries on pimiento cheese . . . . not much left to say . just eat it its loud , so don ' t expect to hear anybody if you ' re in a large group , but you ' ll be happily occupied eating anyway . 
the quality of the service and quality of food left a lot to be desired , especially when you are going to an establishment that is supposed to deliver quality food and service . on our visit , we sat down and ordered a couple drinks and calamari to start . the drinks came and were as to be expected . however , when the calamari came out , it was soggy and the breaded coating was falling off . you could see all the residual oil in the plate . we mentioned it to the waiter and nothing was done about it . we were a little taken back and decided not to order a meal because of how things were handled . we settled up and carried on to a pizza shop down the terminal where we grabbed a few slices of pizza that ended up being a lot more satisfying . it seems too frequent today that establishments find it acceptable to charge inflated prices because of a name and not because of a superior product . unfortunately , we haven ' t been to gallagher ' s since our visit and despite frequently being in newark airport . . . and we plan on keeping it that way . 
eh . . err . . . arrg . i ' m a bit of a food snob these days . . as in . . i don ' t have kids and i plan on using my extra money that i ' m not putting towards retirement towards good food . for cheesesteaks this means barclay prime ' s N cheesesteak . life is good . that said , i suppose one can not live off foie gras , high end salmon , truffles and caviar alone . when i was coming up , i was a geno ' s guy . i still consider myself a geno ' s guy in that . . i ' m going to pick geno ' s over pat ' s if i ' m going to geno ' s . . because , nostalgia perhaps . i think the steaks here are a bit better than pat ' s , perhaps its the rolls that are of better quality . still , these days i find cheesesteaks lacking proper texture qualities unless prepared by a private cook or just at home with some high end local grass fed meats . it seems geno ' s has given into some slight laziness by leaving the meat on the grill too long . . perhaps by stacking it and reheating it . not sure . it just seems dryer than i remember when i was younger . i still love the cheesesteak , wit and wiz . the english only sign i see as more of a character setting than anything else , it doesn ' t bother me nor delight me . it just seems like it was placed there for the attention and with the intent to get that americana feel to it at the peak of the freedom fries phenomena . despite the flaws , i love this place . i love that they are N N . my favorite time to eat here is at N-Nam on a cold rainy fall night . something about that brings back all these nostalgic feelings that bring me an era of being a N year old just with his license who told his mother he was going to school early to uhh . . study for the sat while instead my friends and i would drive here from the suburbs for an early morning breakfast . . or sometimes . . after a concert or party a late evening snack . . occurring at the same time of the day . . . Nam . be it stoned off my face and eating N of these sandwiches or dangerously drunk underage . . and . . well . . eating N of these sandwiches . . this was a staple for my teen years set up by years of my dad and older brothers taking us here after ball games . going here in the cold rainy late fall nights around Nam is just . . . like christmas for me oddly . i just wish the fires that used to burn in the trash cans across the street , neighboring area back in the early-mid Ns were still around . . that smell of wood burning . . rain , fall . . cheesesteaks . err . . . outbeats the N cheesesteak from barclays any day . . however . . i ' m more likely to be willing to spoil myself on barclays once a month and leave geno ' s for a few visits in the fall , winter , and early spring . only recommendations , figure out what ' s making the meat seem dry and cut it off . other than that , i love you guys . . the hell with the haters , keep the english only sign up . . it adds to the feel of the place . will edit typos later . . phone typing these reviews is not fun . 
joya , i wanted to love you more but apparently it ' s not the time yet . i ' ll give you another chance though . please try to have a nicer host ( get rid of that rude host ) . love your food , your service , and ambiance . you ' re losing N stars just because of that guy . 
found this place after a long day apartment hunting . nice people , nice food . def would come back
wow so many bad reviews i love this place whenever i go back to ct i try to go there to eat . seafood combo my fav ! ! ! 
i finally went to this place today after weeks of wanting to get there . i ordered the popeye on a whole wheat pita . it was abosultely awesome and the price was completely reasonable . i can ' t wait to go back and try the falafel trio ! 
all in all , just not impressed . the tv ' s are all playing loudly enough that the music ( in order to be heard ) has to be played even louder , which causes patrons ( in order to be heard ) to speak even louder . so that was my first impression . . . " this place is too damn loud ! ! " . onto the food . to me , food equals love . italian food even more so . cold bread , especially in an italian restaurant ? unforgivable . seriously . . . how difficult is it to have bread wrapped in foil in the oven ? show me you love me with warm bread , and i ' ll show you i love you by coming back again and again . my date had the veal marsala . it was tasty , though tiny bit too salty . a little skimpy for N . N , too . i had the filet cognac . the lobster was tasty , the sauce was quite bland . i am a beef snob , and what killed it for me was that this filet was not aged . you can definitely taste the difference between supermarket beef and aged . i can ' t believe we paid N and were served a supermarket filet . the service was a little cold . i finished my glass of wine just after the entrees were served , and really wanted another , but the waiter didn ' t return until long after we finished eating , so i just had a nice glass of wine when we went home . don ' t get me wrong , it wasn ' t awful . but there was absolutely nothing that would make me want to give it another try . 
i ' m surprised by the postings by folks who don ' t like this place . it ' s a simple greek place like any other place but their food is fantastic . i live within walking distance of park lane pizza in west hartford and i would go to yanni ' s over that place any day . very similar greek style pizza but i think yanni ' s is so much better . their meals are huge and delicious . the staff is super nice and the prices reasonable . i love , love , love their buffalo chicken pizza . no nubbins in the chicken ( scoring huge points for me ! ) and the perfect amount of blue cheese and buffalo sauce . my mom and grandma turned me onto this place ( they are both reliable chowhounds ) and they were right . one more note about the meals ( like the fabulous chicken francais ) . . . there ' s enough for a full meal of leftovers after you ' ve filled your belly in the restaurant . 
it ' s not easy to add something new after N reviews , but here ' s my attempt happy hours on saturday always make me happy . this is a good one , particularly for the food . the dumplings are incredibly light , smooth , and i could bath in the broth . i was stunned that they could get the kobe sliders a perfect pittsburgh rare , and the pork bao buns were quite tasty . the food comes out fast and in no particular order , but i enjoyed that . note to the wise , do not leave here without trying the brussel sprouts . the drink specials are good , but they could use a little more variety on the hh cocktail menu . atmosphere is unique and bold , but somehow maintains an intimate feel . we ' ll definitely be back to visit the sassy bartenders . . . quite the gaggle . 
great pizza , great service and the owner is friendly . i am glad that this place is under new ownership . . . last owner was rude most of the time . only other advise- stick with the pizza the pasta is nothing special and costly . the same with the salads . 
i found this amazing gem of a restaurant while waiting for a friend to meet me at another place . i was early for my friend , so popped into cielo for a drink . i was awed by the atmosphere , friendliness and superior food ! this place is wonderful . the owner manager isabella is so warm and welcoming that i ended up having my friend meet me at cielo instead of our original destination . now i ' m a confirmed fan and will be a die-hard regular . don ' t miss this place ! 
seedy neighborhood but i was here for restaurant week a few years back and the menu was awesome , the food was great and the staff was spectacular . i haven ' t been back ( my wife has ) but a trip in the near future may be in order . 
tried diner . . . . was not disappointed . cool old diner - you don ' t find places like this anymore . the burger is fantastic , sweet onions , buttery bread . . . . i felt my arteries clogging with joy ! ! ! 
what a little gem ! we had the steak taco and chicken enchilada - the ingrdients were fresh and the portions were plentiful . loved the decor and the service was fast and friendly . save youself from the long lines at jose tejas and try this restaurant . 
these tapas are tops ! from the cozy ambiance to the stellar service , tinto has many other places beat but add on the food and wine and it ' s a wonderful dining experience . the portions are just right and the variety on the menu can please any discerning foodie . having gone to tinto with a colleague , i was fortunate to sample N dishes and all of them were fabulous ( there was a Nth but i don ' t eat crab so i can ' t comment ) . when you go ( notice there is no if about it ! ) , you absolutely must order the artichoke dish --i can only describe it as vegetable heaven . the kobe beef brocheta and the diver scallops were divine and can satisfy the seafood lovers and beef lovers alike . and of course , there was dessert . . . the chocolate y cafe may be the best layer cake i ' ve ever eaten the layers of almond meringue , ganache , buttercream , and chocolate were distinct enough to delight but subtle enough to blend harmoniously . i could go on and on but you ' ve seen enough to make your reservations now ! i really want to try the sister restaurant , amada , soon . . . 
my boyfriend and i love coming to this place whenever we visit nyc . we first stumbled on this place N years ago on our first nyc trip and loved it so much we went back twice during our trip . this time around we were back N times during our recent trip to nyc . the food here is amazing and they have a large selection of sake to choose from ! we love their hamachi kama . it ' s really worth trying . the deep fried chicken gizzards are also worth trying . they are seasoned perfectly and have a great crunch to them . we also tried the deep fried frog legs and they were surprisingly good too . we never had frog before but are really glad we gave them a try . i ' ve never been disappointed in the food and the best part is they are open til Nam ! i definitely recommend checking this place out . 
as an experienced juice lover , i was extremely disappointed by this establishment . i tried a juice combo of carrot apple ginger and was eager to be delighted . however , the juice came warm , the carrot overpowered the whole drink , and the vegetables are not organic , so the juice had a dirty taste . for N a serving , the juice should be organic , cold , and mixed right , not warm dirty and carroty . on top of that , the people " helping " me were cold , distant , and didn ' t even make eye contact , and did not even look at me to respond to a question i ' d asked . i ' d recommend you save your money and juice your own organic fruits and veggies . 
went to meritage on saturday night for dinner . overall , an enjoyable experience with some interesting cuisine and great service but it was a bit loud . the food was great and was reasonably priced but the portions were a bit on the small side . i would have gladly paid a wee bit more to have slightly larger portions but that ' s the balance that surely challenges restaurateurs . i had the brisket , which was fabulous - rich , perfectly prepared with a great parsnip puree . my wife had the sea scallops , which were also well-prepared and tasty . the initial plates were fine but not nearly as terrific as the larger plates . the pei mussels were great the dumplings were ok but we could have used one more in the order and the chick pea fries were interesting but there ' s only so far one can go with chick peas in this capacity . it is always a nice touch when a restaurant doesn ' t rip you off on booze and meritage definitely had an affordable drink menu . the primary issue was the noise of the dining room . i always appreciate a festive room , and everyone was having a good time ( to the point of being a wee bit boisterous ) but this a little annoying in light of the close quarters . overall , a very positive experience and i would surely go back . 
i came here yesterday on the strength of yelp reviews and being on a diet . sushi is healthy ( as long as you don ' t overdo the tempura and sauces ! ) , and very low in calories , so i got the lunch special of a tuna roll and a salmon roll . the special comes with miso ( i don ' t like miso . who wants it ? ) and a salad . i find it to be a good deal , mostly because sushi is always expensive . usually N bucks for a roll . each roll had N pieces and is pretty fresh . i ' m not a sushi connoisseur . i ' m not sure what good sushi really is . all i ever taste is wasabi and soy . but , it didn ' t make my stomach hurt ( so that means fresh right ? ) and i was somewhat full after eating it ( a good thing when you ' re on a diet ! ) . i need to try the olden roll or any roll that has tempura in it . i ' m sure it ' ll taste amazing , but i have to wait another N weeks ! 
went here recently for a birthday dinner . the inside of the place was very pretty . we had a large party which they accommodated easily so they get points there . the food was just ok , nothing special . once we ordered we didn ' t see a waitress for over and hour , our drinks were empty and people were thirsty . the worst part was , the hot sake was barely warm - ( 
great atmosphere , great food . best hot wings in the upper valley ! people , you gotta try this place you will glad you did ! 
we were visiting new york . we stayed on stanten island . we chose denino ' s based on yelp reviews . i am so glad that we did . it was the best in my life . they were packed when we first got there but they got us in a booth in N minutes . it ' s a very casual family atmosphere . we started out with cheese sticks . they were home made and amazing . we got a trash can pizza and a half cheese and pepperoni bell pepper . all of it was awesome . we were practically drooling . i definitely recommend this place . i ' m going to be sad when i leave new york cause they don ' t have them in ga . though i hear they might be getting one in austin tx . 
great food , period . walking in doesn ' t give you a great impression as the tables are fit for barbie and ken , not for adults eating lunch . . . first time at a garces restaurant , and as soon as we walked in - taking advantage of a wonderful fall afternoon , we asked for al fresco seating , which meant we had tables twice the size of the inside tables . most lunch guests were eating at counter seats , either facing the bar , or with their faces two inches from a wall . sorry , not for me . the outside seats , on the other hand , are ample and spacious . . . the service was absolutely impeccable . our waiter was a master in the art of being there when we needed something and not being there when he wasn ' t needed . food wise , it was superb . the duck french fries are absolutely yummy , if a direct line to the cardiac ward . and the hamburger with avocado was out of this world , a full half pound of beef . other than the unimpressive seating inside of the restaurant , this is a winner . it would rate higher if the accommodations were in line with the food and service quality . but for a lunch time rendezvous with great friends , it was absolutely great ! 
the cellar at beecher ' s definitely has a couple things going for it . N . ) they have cheese . amazing . N . ) their cocktails are delicious . try the " players club . " my one quirk about cheese-based restaurants i feel like the cheese itself always outshines the food . we started with a nice camembert , which came with crackers and dried cherries . so good . but , when it came to the main dishes meatballs and the crab mac and cheese , i was disappointed . don ' t get me wrong , the food is good . i definitely plan to eat here again . but , it just didn ' t live up the expectations set by the cheese . ( to be fair , this is how i feel about every cheese place i ' ve been to . ) overall , the cellar at beecher ' s is a great place . i love the atmosphere , the drinks are delicious , the food is good , and the cheese is amazing . definitely check it out . 
great place ! i love the ambiance . this place has two areas inside and when its nice outside they open up the patio . their burger , fries , onion rings are amazing . i went to several business events there and every time it was success . great beer and overall alcohol selection . i would recommend this place to everyone ! 
the food is bad the service is bad , it ' s a very dirty , the food was raw or over cooked , the salad was oily its stinks and the only two things worth getting are the shrimp and french fries . the benches are falling apart . it is not worth going to . 
do you like what sushi in america has become ? do you think mayonnaise , especially hot mayonnaise is delicious ? the best sushi i have ever had has been fish on rice . . . . this place is not where you go for that . . . . though i will say this place is one of the best roll manufacturer ' s i have consumed . if you are a roll fan go here . this place will teach you a lesson . if you like fish and it ' s subtle delicacies steer clear . the next step or even the last three won ' t be found here . 
if you ' re going for sunday brunch , it ' s going to be packed . call N minutes to an hour ahead , and you can be seated almost immediately after you arrive . avoid the orange juice . it ' s fresh squeezed ( apparently by monks ) , and they hit you for N bucks a glass - with no free refills . it has no pulp and tastes like it ' s from concentrate . go for one of the many other breakfast juice options . if you ' re a bacon and eggs kind of brunch person , this place isn ' t for you . the portions are big . the challah french toast - regular or stuffed - is fantastic . unfortunately , that ' s the best part . some basic sides - a cup of fruit or a side of bacon - will run you at least N to N each , and the portions there aren ' t much to speak of . if you want some fantastic french toast and a good cup of coffee , and don ' t mind calling ahead or waiting , sabrina ' s is great for brunch . but if you want a bit of variety without being nickel and dimed ( or in this case , N-and-N-dollared ) for it , there ' s better options to be found in the city . 
awesome chicken fingers . the manager gave me a free bada bing to try , and now i ' m hooked . 
i was very very disappointed with the service at this establishment upon receiving my dinner , the food was dry and was obviously prepared at some point in the morning or the night before and was in no shape or form deemed fit to be served to someone and by no means have that person charged for it for that matter . and not to mention the unprofessionalism , i can understand some people are not in a position to own a business and be able to pay for a child care service , but if you have to have your children at your place of business then at least keep them off the counter and not sleeping on the chairs in the waiting area , and not for nothing i i don ' t think it ' s morally proper let alone legal to have children preparing food for customers , that seams as tho it could pose serious health code violations in my mind , plus the kids are playing on the surfaces that the food is prepared on ! i personally watched the same person take the trash out and walk in and was handed my food and packaged it for me and didn ' t even rinse their hands let alone wash them properly . in my opinion your taking a chance eating here , i hate to get into details but the rest room was my best friend for atleast a day and a half after eating there . the business was highly unprofessional and the food was i hate to say but terrible , it ' s poorly prepared it ' s dry and flavorless , and not for nothing it ' s served to you like some old timey fish market " crudely wrapped in aluminum foil " , this will be the last time i ever eat there , i was so strongly disgusted i felt it was only appropriate to share my experience . ronald . w
i ' m a big fan of italian food so by default carmines score some brownie points right off the bat . they have the best seafood linguine in the city . must have shrimp scampi . the downside is that you need to go with a party of N or more and the service can be slow at times . 
i adore ponty and eat there as much as i can . i try to steer myself away from the branzino but it haunts me . everyone is so friendly . the last time i was there with a friend , we met a pretty famous celebrity . i won ' t tell you who he is since . . . . this is a favorite place of his as well . . the food is delicious . i am so happy to have this restaurant in my community . maybe one of these days i will add variety to my choice and ask for something else . . . . however , that branzino calls me . . . 
good yakitori good atmosphere . 
buenisimo todo . atencion impecable
i always promised myself that if i ever joined yelp , my first review would be for perilla . i went for the first time about N and a half years ago . oh well , better late than never . perilla is my favorite " go-to " restaurant in nyc . reasonable prices , great atmosphere , lovely staff . dinner and brunch are both amazing . i love that you can bring a date or a group of friends for a night out . things to keep an eye out for N . spicy duck burger basically a huge spicy duck meatball . what ' s not to love ? N . perilla cocktail sometimes it ' s not available , but it ' s refreshing and not too sweet . my absolute favorite . N . veal pork combination lovely , lovely . tender , lots of flavor , and i normally don ' t like pork all too much . i was very unimpressed , actually more disappointed , with the desserts . i would recommend skipping it all together here , but if you watch top chef , you ' ll understand why . amazing brunch , dinner , and service all outshine the bleh desserts . love perilla ! 
i ' ve been to village whiskey twice now the first time i learned a very important lesson about sharing a burger and fries with a friend ( plates are huge and i was stuffed ! ) as well as taking septa and or a cab instead of driving myself and or my friends ( drinks are strong and had to cut off the fun so we could get home ok ! ) the second time was pure foodie bliss ! we got there a little bit later then i wanted and we already knew we were in for a long wait . the hostess said she would take our name and phone number so she could call when something opened up . since she was banking on a N minute wait we headed down Nth to grab a drink elsewhere . we weren ' t even N blocks away when she called to say something had opened up . we returned to find a great table waiting for us in the outside seating area . our waiter was awesome , he was polite and attentive as well as super knowledgeable about both the food and drink menus . the food was delicious N of us shared the lobster roll , a burger and the fries with cheese sauce . i was drinking whiskey sours made with egg whites , ( which , i found out , is actually called a boston sour ) and they are just delightful ! as far as the wait is concerned . . . just get over it . village whiskey is a bar with an awesome food menu not a spectacular restaurant with an awesome bar menu . the place isn ' t equipped to handle big parties that are so desperate to celebrate in this small space . thanks to that damn " best burger " review there will forever and always be a wait at village whiskey it just is what it is . 
i was so excited to try this restaurant as i love filipino food . i got the grilled pork chop with fresh lumpia from their lunch combo . i was extremely disappointed ! how can you go wrong with grilled pork chop and fresh lumpia sauce ? maybe the pork that day wasn ' t fresh that it had this odd smell that i couldn ' t bear to eat after N-N bites . the lumpia sauce looks like they added some soy sauce that it tasted like the typical lumpia peanut sauce with soy sauce--wasn ' t good at all . i was so disappointed because i brought lunch from home for work that day but decided to go for pandan restaurant . the food was so bad that i had to throw the rest of them and didn ' t even get to eat half of it . for dessert , i had pandan delight which was thankfully good . the pandan delight was pretty big that it was basically what i had for lunch that day as the combo was unbearable . i will definitely order pandan delight again but skeptical to try other dishes . try them yourself , maybe you might like them just like some other but definitely not for me . 
woww last night was my first time at el almacen and i want to say that it was N of the best meat i have ever ate . the service was perfect ! ! ! thank you guys and i ' ll be back
i visited this little gem on saturday and was treated to some really good eats . i had the creme antiques french toast and it was to die for . my friend had the bacon , egg and cheese which i sampled and the flavor was phenomenal . i did have a little wait for the food but it was well worth it to have all the items cooked to order . i will definitely be back for more ! 
visited my girlfriends parents in ny and they took us to this place . good food , good service . when we are in ny again , we ' ll definitely stop by this place . memorable experience . 
what happened here- it uses to be so good but it has changed this year . what a miserable experience we had . a big mistake to go to lunch with N people . the service was slow - we ordered and waited forever . all the food was lousy . the kiddies macaroni and cheese came covered with breadcrumbs- what N year understands that ? when i asked to send it back i was told they would charge me for another one ! our fish tacos had almost no fish just a few crumbles but tons of cole slaw the same with the shrimp one . our fried shrimp and scallop was all breading and really small shrimp and only N small scallops the tomato mozzarella salad was of poor quality with mushy tomatoes and firm cheese . with such poor quality food we will never go back again . we all felt abused at this place . 
cute restaurant in heart of montclair . very large menu with lots of specialty roles . i reco the tuna sashimi appetizer . price is fair . byob huge plus . if you are a local , i would reco trying . 
this is the first time i have eaten here and it was fantastic ! i had a few of the specialty rolls and the complimentary miso soup . the fish was fresh and everything was great . i recommend the west orange roll ! they gave us a complimentary seared shrimp roll which was also very good . i am definitely coming back here . 
i love everything they have . a great value for nyc . best chicken parm i ' ve ever had , and i ' ve ordered it in just about every restaurant that offers it . the best part about this place is the service . i go there all the time , and they recognize me . they ' re warm , friendly and treat my family great every time i go . i like that they take the time to be nice to their customers . it encourages loyalty ( along with the great food ) 
i have been to chestnut cafe numerous times over the past two years , and it continues to be my favorite eatery in town . family-owned with a very comfortable and friendly atmosphere . may get a little crowded on weekends , but definitely worth the wait , if there is a wait . all of the menu items are great , but my favorites are the buffalo eggs benedict , signature croissant french toast , and mediterranean chicken dinner . 
try their varying assortment of pizzas and what is a decent selection of beers . the bbq sauce here is probably in the top ten bbq sauces i have tried . 
this would be a four-star review , if it weren ' t for the price . my mother and i both met in nyc for a meal , and while we both thoroughly enjoyed the food , i think we would agree it wasn ' t quite worth that price . my advice would be to stick to the basics - we each ordered the striped bass with artichokes , potatoes in a carrot purue ( i usually think of carrot as a flavor for the peons , however this was extremely rich , flavorful , exotic ) - the fish was cooked perfectly and the skin added a great texture to the top - highly recommend ! ( N person ) - the brussel sprouts side with toasted almonds , golden raisins and cranberries might ' ve been the highlight ( which could be because i ' m obsessed with brussel sprouts ) . the crunch of the almonds with the sweetness of the raisins cranberries - made for a delectable dish ( which we finished ) . ( N ) i would avoid the desserts - we shared the following - the chai pudding parfait - good , but not great . it ' s a small parfait cup , and the chai is quite mild . . so while it ' s a huge risk and could have had a great upside , it didn ' t meet the bar . ( N ) - gingerbread cake - for me , this was just a lot of flavors put together on one plate ( gingerbread , apricot confit , molasses mousse , ice cream , marshmallows , caramel curl ) . my mother said the molasses flavor complemented the ginger perfectly . . perhaps i ' m just not as big a fan of the individual flavors . ( N ) anyway - the service was good , the wine was good , the entrees and sides were perfect . . however the place got progressively louder over the evening , and the bill came to N ( pre-tip ) . i ' d only recommend perilla conditionally ( i . e . if you have a bottomless wallet ) , but we enjoyed our evening there ! 
i definitely recommend it for at least a try if you ' re in the area . however i ' d stay away from the cold foods and focus on the hot ones as they tasted better N N times . could be personal preference though . 
the beer list changes often , but there is rarely an ipa ( black ipa maybe ) . the food is hit or miss . eight of us at the table and four dishes were enjoyed and the other four were disappointing . also , those chairs ! simply not comfortable . i prefer the older sibling , hawthorne ' s . 
basically my favorite seafood restaurant just about anywhere . super fresh and delicious fish that is never frozen . as environmentally bad as it is , the chilean sea bass is to die for . i ' ve also had great luck with the barramundi , sockeye salmon , tuna , and several other fish entrees . i inevitably find the menu a bit overwhelming , so usually a helpful server can help you make a choice . they don ' t take reservations which has greatly limited the number of times i ' ve been able to enjoy their food . their preparations are also very simple , don ' t expect anything elaborate done to the fish . if you don ' t want to pay the pricey dinner prices , the little shop next door will make fresh lunch sandwiches which are often delicious and filling for N-N--a well kept secret . it ' s also byob which i love . 
i recently made it back here with a group of people . not like last time , the place was so empty on friday evening ! i was like , oh what ' s up with this place ? and looked at the menu , there have been some changes to it , anyway we ordered a few plates to share . food was generally ok to good , but i feel like it was better before . service was still great . 
pesto lasagna . to die for . 
horrible
this hidden italian mediterranean jewel was a great find for me and my guests . we had a party of N and upon arrival was treated to fresh foccacia bread with evoo . everything from the appetizers to our main course to the dessert presentation was delicious . the servers were courteous and professional and the food came out in a timely manner . i was told they had a new management team as well as a new culinary team . it really showed . i will be back and bring others with me . 
great food . great service . reasonable pricing . very cozy . 
lea is a regular for my friends and i but our last visit was very disappointing . called in advance to find out the dinner menu . when we arrived at the restaurant we found out that the original protein had been substituted by a regular pork sausage that is usually served for brunch for two thirds of the cost . what ' s upsetting is that why was the protein substituted and served with cabbage for the same price as the original item and not Ned . the substitution was so unproportioned that we had to order pizza on the side to compensate for a meal that wasn ' t even close to an entr e . the decision making on this was a big hit and miss . lea please reevaluate and be more relative . get it right or don ' t have it on the menu . please don ' t sell customers short . . . 
having worked in restaurants in philadelphia and knowing some of the crew responsible for this restaurant i will try to be as objective as possible , and in turn knowing that you shouldn ' t visit a restaurant in it ' s first week before they ' ve gotten all the kinks worked out , my wife and i couldn ' t resist checking it out on day N . we ' ll of course go back and see the progression in a few weeks if not sooner , especially when we can go back for lunch in the future ( inevitable ) , but i have to say that we thought this restaurant was solid from the minute we walked in the door . to be totally honest this is not a N star restaurant , the five stars are there because it wildly exceeded my expectations for the place N days in and for the concept as a whole . host staff was on it from the get go getting us seated right away and most importantly acknowledging our existence before we even crossed the doorway . the decor is somewhat of a cross between a futuristic diner and a starkly minimal momofuku-esque food bar . not sure why there aren ' t more restaurants with open kitchen bars , seeing as in this world full of new " foodies " stuck to their tv sets watching every cooking show in existence , wouldn ' t they want to recreate that experience live in the restaurants they actually eat in ? maybe this is the future ? while we didn ' t sit at the bar we will in the future and were disappointed that we didn ' t make that decision this time . michael shulson was on hand in the kitchen and despite the place being somewhat empty at N N when we arrived , by Npm the place was getting packed and the open kitchen was bustling . the led backlit forest is a very inviting sight from the sidewalk and surely an " open " sign for all those passing by . anyway , we noticed many familiar staff from stalwart restaurants such as buddakan and morimoto surely attributing to the casual , efficient and unobtrusive service style . the menu is set up in an approachable small plate style with great pricing . you could probably get out of here for N a person , but it ' s hard to resist ( especially on a first visit ) not ordering everything to try and walk out having spent much more ( but isn ' t that the point of the small plate movement ) . first things first , michael shulson is famous for his edamame dumplings to which he made famous at buddakan but you won ' t find the same delicate petite dumplings here but more of a authentic chinese style soft dumpling ( read thicker doughier skin , and in my experience working with chinese chefs this is the real thing ) . many people may dismiss the dumplings as less refined than those of the style he created at buddakan but it certainly pleased my wife and i to see this style in such a restaurant in philadelphia and we hope others can appreciate it as well . i also hate to say it but the philly cheese steak ( yet another restaurant twisting philly ' s namesake food ) with sriracha was fantastic . and the pork bahn mi . at N i predict this being my lunch on many days headed to work . for what you would pay to eat a sandwich ( and i mean this is a cheesesteak sized roll ) for almost the same price anywhere in center city , you can have this instead . we had the lobster gyoza , which wasn ' t our favorite but was solid with a great presentation and the inclusion of what looked like some sort of dehydrated chili balanced with the sweet and acidic N-N combo of apples and miso . finally we had the shrimp egg fried rice with virginia ham , and i have to say that shulson wins the prize of having the most delicate but fully seasoned fried rice in town . light but full of flavor ! the wine prices are approachable and we had the jovly vouvray at N ( a deal considering it is real loire chenin ) , perfect for the food we had . it arrived less than cold , but possibly had just arrived that day considering how soon after the open we came . overall a great experience for a concept which we had our eyes on because we are fans of david chang ' s momofuku restaurants in the east village and wanted something similar in our neighborhood . next time we ' ll be hitting up the ramen and making the comparison . great new restaurant for center city . 
this is the second time i came here for ramen . i didn ' t like it the first time around . i couldn ' t remember what i ordered , but i did remember the pork not being fresh . last night , however , after a grueling N hour wait , i got to try ippudo ramen again . we started out with pork buns , which were pretty solid . they were tasty ( especially the fatty part ) and the lettuce gave a nice crunchy texture . the sauce was a bit spicy , but it added to the flavor of the pork . we also ate chicken wings- they were spicy , sweet and crispy , but not the best ones i ' ve had . they weren ' t as good as san tung ' s or um ma son chicken wings . . . with oozing spicy , garlic sweet sauce . they weren ' t bad though . i ordered the modern ramen with garlic oil . the soup was nice and light compared to the creamier broth in the classic ramen . the thin egg noodles were sooooo delicious ! ! ! they were very fresh and fit perfectly with the rest of the meal . this time the pork was perfect . . . " melt in your mouth " flavor . i recommend getting a nice beer on the side to balance the savory-ness of the broth . my sister thinks it ' s better than santa ramen which is a huge statement to make . too bad the wait is so long . ( 
i have to say for me never a disappointment . . . at N in the morning or at N in the afternoon . . . the triple mac cheese is awesome and the rib sandwich is one of my favorites . . . the breakfast selection is good as well
i went to this restaurant with my cousin who frequents this establishment . it is a great place to eat and relax . i enjoyed the delicious food and wine . the restaurant is dimly lit and it has big windows . it has beautiful dark wood throughout the restaurant . i like the small candles at the bar and tables . the flowers on the table and bar area added a nice touch as well . the spacing between the seats is a little tight however it is cool . my cousin and i were discussing a book and the table next to us read the same book . all four of us had a nice conversation . there is seating by the windows and it is cool to see the neighborhood . you can sit by the window and feel the nightly breeze on your skin . there is also seating at the bar which is great as well . this restaurant could have been in an episode of sex and the city . i could see carrie bradshaw having brunch here to work on her column or the ladies getting together to gossip . we were attended by devon and carter . devon is awesome and friendly . he made me feel really welcomed . carter was nice and he selected a great wine for me . i do not recall the name however it smelled like a sweet fragrance . we had an appetizer that consisted of bread , cheeses and various meats which was excellent . my cousin had the meat and mozzarrella pizza that was delicious . i had the chicken breast salad and it was good . the food was fresh and amazing . for dessert , my cousin had the apple tart with cinnamon ice cream . i never had a dessert like this and i was pleasantly surprised . overrall , i was very pleased with my dining experience at grape and grain . this place can handle all your needs whether you are having a dining experience with a group of friends or one friend . this place looks great for couples especially first dates . the vibe is cool and the prices are reasonable . i look forward coming here again . also , the bathroom is very clean . i was surprised that i didn ' t have to look out for " droplets " on the toilet seat . not only is grape and grain a cool place to chill but it is very clean as well . please check this place out because you will have a good time ! ! 
fresh and crispy . . . even with delivery . the naked strips were good for the kids . truffle fries were great too . favorite sauces garlic , golden honey mustard , and white bbq . 
you know what . . . this was not what i expected at all . anytime i ' ve been to cheesecake factory it ' d be to take out . . . cheesecakes , haha . well this time around i actually sat in and ate . so the wait was about half an hour but worth it . got a drink at the bar with my boo , my amaretto sour was just fine . the place looked nice . little tight , not enough spacing for my taste between tables but eh . the place was full . server was nice , listened to my N questions and answered . very attentive . i had the moroccan chicken entree , it was delicious , absolutely delicious . i don ' t remember what my boyfriend had but he had another chicken entree , i don ' t remember how that was either but who cares ! my moroccan chicken was . . . delicious ! we had strawberry smoothies , they were pretty tasteful and fresh . not super sugary . mmm , dessert , for the life of me i do not remember what it was called . . . some sort of coffee cheesecake that had kahlua in it . . . awesome , awesome . it was pretty good stuff . i would definitely go again ! 
because i despise cooking , i get a delivery of meals from miss rachel every week . she is an angel on earth ! each meal is incredibly creative , healthy and made with love . they leave you feeling wonderful and full of energy . she is more than willing to accommodate your likes and dislikes , resulting in meals that are designed for your unique taste buds ! 
ive been a longtime fan of paesanos and have been coming here since they opened . they easily make some of the best sandwiches in the city . all of their sammies are delish and your cant go wrong with anything on the menu ! my personal favs are the arista , paesano , gustaio , and the diavola . their sandwiches are best eaten at the counter as the molecular structure of the sandwich ( really just the bread ) changes completely after its been infused by the sandwiches essential essences for more than a few minutes ! my only minor gripe with paesanos is that most of the og guys who worked at the girard ave . spot either moved to the south philly location or maybe to one of peters restaurants . those og guys ( you know who you are ! ) made you feel like a regular , remembering your name and favorite sandwiches . for me , it just took the whole experience over the top and i do miss it . i guess if you never experienced it , you wont miss it ! also , as of late it seems the prices of everything have increased a bit . bottom line- go here and discover the " art of the sandwich " . i would avoid going on the weekends and during prime time lunch hours . also , dont go too late as they sometimes run out of bread and other essential ingredients . if you can make it when they are not super busy your sandwich will be crafted with extra care and your eating experience will be more pleasant . 
i don ' t typically post low rates but i had a need to let others know about our " valentine ' s diner at vivo " , that ended up being a comedy since we have a great sense of humor . . . to start we were told there were no tables available without a prior reservation but we could sit at the bar , which we did . seating at the bar was more private than the packed tables that you could see ended up talking to each other after they returned their under cooked meals . the bartender read off the valentine ' s special and already started complaining that it was very busy night . the valentine ' s special offered N tapas , N entrees , a bottle of wine , a bottle of champagne and N desserts for N ! which seemed as a good deal , since it included wine and champagne . to start we were served hot , white wine ! ! ! the tapas were ok ! after the tapas the only nice attendant at this place removed our settings and N min later when our food arrived , the other bartender starts asking us who took them , and why we didn ' t stop her ! ! ! if we planned to eat with our hands because that was not that kind of restaurant , lol ! ! i ordered stuffed tilapia , which to my surprise was stuffed with under cooked shrimp ! ! ! ! the rice was tasteless and the veggies seems microwaved . . . a complete disappointment . by this time the " manager " had by passed us and bumped me chairs our N times with out even excusing him self and cursing every two min because he had not been told they were running out of wine and the waiters kept walking around with the food plates because they didnt know the table numbers . i had ordered strawberries with chocolate ganache for dessert , and my husband ordered the lava cake . . . but instead i was served creme brulee and he got cold chocolate cake and melted ice cream . . . i let them know wit was the wrong dessert and it took them Nmin to bring me old dry strawberries on sticks with a cold chocolate dipping sauce . . . the champagne bottle , turned into two glasses of champagne . . . and the bartenders for the lounge started getting the juice bottles ready almost on top of our plates . but since we had not stopped laughing at the craziness this place was , and the music was starting we decided to stay and see if the lounge was any better . until we were asked for our chairs because it was getting to crowded and we decided to call it a night . . . 
we love mob , a restaurant serving healthful food without compromising on taste , or on ambiance - this place is fun-ky . the prices are reasonable , the servers are so friendly and nice , and we are all about the local organic bit ( but this is brooklyn , so - duh ) . we were regulars as soon as we walked in , and we bet you will be , too . see you at mob ! 
easily one of the best i have had in a while . the atmosphere was classic east village . small , loud , friendly , and fun . the staff was friendly and very accommodating . food was superb . fried chick to rival any i have had and the coffee rubbed pork loin melted in your mouth . of course we had to have the pretzels and cheese beer dip too . overall we had a great time and some great eats . kudos to louisiana native , meg grace on an outstanding creation . 
this place is awesome . even when the rest of montclair is dead for lunch , this place has a wait ! and for good reason ! we stumbled on this place the other day and were surprised at how great the food and service were even though there were only N waiters for the whole restaurant . i will definitely be coming back and i highly recommend it . 
the perfect " city " brunch . living in brooklyn , i try with all my might not to go in to the city on the weekends , but a cousin was in town over memorial day weekend and i was able to get a prime reservation for N on monday brunch . cookshop has all the makings of a successful manhattan brunch outing busy bustling , good music , great drinks , strong coffee , lots of tables , and surprisingly good food ! i can ' t recall what everyone ordered , but i had the deviled eggs and radish salad . perfect . refreshing . fun . highly recommended for an energetic weekend . check out the new section of the high line that just opened with its entrance across the street . 
tried juni for a client lunch N weeks ago and we were both blown away with the quality of food , impeccable service and price ! everything that was served was a work of art and each bite was divine ! deliciousness included - avocado , prawns ( aussie speak for shrimp ) and cucumber blossoms - hanger tenderloin with truffle - deconstructed pavlova ? it wasn ' t called that but that ' s what it tastes like . i need to find the review that i read that said this would be in the michelin guide for N as they were right ! 
find another pizza place . way over priced for cheaply made pizza . dominos is better compared to this place . total disappointment and a waste of N . 
the food is very good- that is not the problem . but if part of dining out is the company and conversation of those you are with , forget it . the noise level on this saturday night was deffining . everyone in there was nearly screaming , certainly shouting , and one table near us were actually screaming as they told their story to each other . one problem might be the byob which means folks bring quite a bit that won ' t go on the bill , and they drink a lot . the other problem is we called and made a reservation but that didn ' t matter . we still waited N minutes for our table and a party of two who the host knew , who had no reservation , we ' re seated in a matter of minutes . once we were seated it took one hour before our entrees arrived . the salads that came before that we ' re good , but not enough to hold the wait and make up for the roar of noise in that tiny space . i never would have waited on the hot sidewalk for N minutes , for that audio torture had i understood that was what we were in store for . i ' ll never go back to porcini ' s again . 
i love good vegetarian food . . . having been one for a while in college ( somehow that sounds like i was experimenting with a new religion or something . . . hrmph ) . . . but i just dont know why the servings are small , most of the food is bland , and the prices are so high . so , a few things that i have had that come to mind N ) smoothies . . . took some N minutes to have one made when there was no one in the restaurant , and it was still bland N ) gardenburger . . . eh . . . better than the frozen boca burgers , but could be improved N ) insert applause here compliment coming . . . their lithuanian coffee cake is great ( a bit dry and a little too much icing . . . but its still awesome ) 
get into the spicy green bean for dinner this month ! ! ! we started with the super sweet pizza a fried dough base with grilled capicola , basil , spinach fresh mozz ( finally found a way to get my N year old son to eat spinach ! ) he followed it with a burger , cooked to perfection , on a delicious pretzel roll and the best french fries ever . i opted for the blackened swordfish , served on herbed risotto with a side of sweet creamed corn off the cob . what an amazing flavor explosion ! we enjoyed our perfect meals ( the special included a yummy fresh salad ) outside at a cozy table on the patio . our server , laura , could not have been more attentive . she also took a few moments to chat with us , and was eager to help us order what we would like most . grab your favorite bottle of wine and head in for dinner on a thursday , friday or saturday this month . you won ' t regret that decision ! ! ! 
mussels . mussels . mussels . in lovely red sauce with an ipa to wash it down . what more could i ask for . . . . perhaps stools and tables not so far off of the ground . 
well , i ' m sorry to say i have a lot of stories about claire ' s and none of them are good . it ' s really so bad that when i go to vegetarian restaurants in the environs of new haven and people hear that ' s where i live , i get the sympathetic " oh , all you have there is claire ' s " conversation all over again . claire ' s is simply bad . the food is absolutely awful . they can ' t even manage to put a drink together properly and i ' ve given them ample opportunity - with a menu that large i figured they must have something worth eating . i have dietary restrictions that make claire ' s one of my only convenient options but after we saw them eat off of our plate before it came out , after we received a cobb salad with no cobb salad ingredients but with an entire head of broccoli on top including skin and after we ordered the only decent thing we could find on the menu many times only to have it come out differently every time my friends and i finally gave up on the place . to beat all , it ' s ridiculously expensive , especially for a cafeteria style restaurant that couldn ' t cook up decent food if it tried . we actually exchange stories of the horrors of claire ' s with friends . why people continue to patronize this place is one of the great mysteries of new haven , as far as i ' m concerned . 
great place but fyi the " vegetable meatballs " are made of black beans and veggies . . . not beef and veggies ! 
why doesn ' t this place have more credit for their wings ? better than j-tims ( newington , ct ) in my opinion for those of you who are appreciate a good wing and a pint the tavern is for you . good beer selection although i ' ve seen better . service is also prompt , i had the blue boy burger that was mouthwatering and cooked perfectly . ( N outta N ) my girlfriend had the tavern salad with walmuts , cranberry and fetta , it was good but had way too much dressing . i ' d ask for sauce on side . defiantly a return
my review is based on a recent dinner at clinton st . baking co . , and is in no way a reflection of their brunch , which i vaguely remember as being awesome , but that was awhile ago because i ' m now old and have no patience to wait for food . upon arriving on a random weekday , there were no other patrons in the restaurant . at least we were seated right away . i ordered the crab cakes and a side of onion rings , hubby got the blt with fried shrimp for an app . the blt was pretty good with avocado and nice thick bacon . but the rest was , obviously fried but greasy and flavorless . my crab cakes were also fried , which i should have asked , but i was not a fan . they were N small balls of fried crab on top of a huge pile of thick cut sweet potato fries . i guess i was expecting more from a place that is know for great comfort american food . i was expecting flavor . maybe i ' ll be back for brunch again . . . maybe not . . . 
jane has a lovely selection of benedicts , and benedict in general is my very favorite brunch dish . the johnny is wonderfully sweet and savory , and the lobster benny is scrumptiously buttery . i have a hard time getting away away from a benny of some sort here , but on the one occasion i veered and ordered french toast , it was fluffy and satisfying . jane also gets points for the bread basket with strawberry butter ( that ' s right , i said butter . not cream cheese . so don ' t go slathering a scoop onto your bread like i did the first time . ) as claire mentioned , even with a reservation there is usually a bit of a wait ( and i always pity people who try to walk in without one ) . but when we came for our yearly v-day brunch and had to wait N minutes past our res time , the hostess was sweet and apologetic , and they sent a plate of warm donuts over as soon as we were seated as an apology . that warmed us almost as much as the sunshine beaming through the window . 
the husband doesn ' t do " wine and cheese " so i went with some girlfriends and we stayed for . . . N hours . that ' s how awesomely chill this place is ! great specials and a nice selection of wines menu had some great bites on there ( we let the bartender pick out our cheeses so i can ' t say which was which but N N were delicious ) . we also had the grilled cheese with truffle oil ( ahmazing ! and came with a tasty lightly dressed arugula salad side -- perfect to share with a friend ) . bartender picked our cheese selections the basque salami went so well with the cheeses and my rose wine the slab of bacon was a good size and very fatty juicy overall a very chill atmosphere - never felt rushed and never felt overcrowded although it got fairly packed for a wednesday night . . . tiny seats so if your tushy is a bit oversized , might not be the place for you ) 
pizzeria vetri is a five star pizza joint . casual atmosphere with great pizza and a very good beer menu as well . all of the pizzas are very creative but my favorite is the margherita pie . the square pie slices are also very good and they usually have two different types that rotate each time you come in . this is not a five star fine dining establishment like vetris name sake restaurant , but if you ' re looking for a casual dining scene to grab some pizza it is e best in the city . 
there have been many times that i ' ve been in the k-town area and craved some hot korean food , but loathed to actually sit down and eat at one of the wonderful restaurant options in k-town . woorijip is like the oasis in the dessert . stumble in , pick up some snacks , some hot food - like duk bok kee , jap chae , bulgogi , katsu curry , omurice , etc , kim bap and tons of drinks both alcoholic and not and you ' ve got something to look forward to on the way home . that is if half of it even make it that far . . . 
good food with friendly service always crowded and noisy but the food is good with prices to match
overrated . . . . . . . i expected more and was a little disappointmented . i will not be back here
came here for a private business event . there was about N of us . service was excellent and the wait staff was courteous . however , the food was subpar but i ' m sure there is a dish that would give this place N stars , hence the N stars . i would have given them N stars but i felt that would be too harsh . one thing to note is the " butter " they give you with the bread . we had vegetarians with us and i thought it was just regular butter but it wasn ' t . if i tasted it correctly , it has salmon flavor infused into it . so be careful if you are vegetarian that doesn ' t eat seafood . i like the concept but not practical . i had the lobster bisque , herb roasted alaskan halibut , yukon gold whipped potatoes and glazed carrots . when the lobster bisque soup came , it had scattered pockets of what appeared to be film on the top layer of the soup . maybe it was fat . i don ' t know , it looked very unappealing . then i tried the soup and it was quite awful . the soup was bitter and too salty . they do give quite big pieces of lobster meat , which was fine , but the soup base , flavor , and seasoning was terrible . i saw some people not even bother finishing the soup . the halibut looked nice , tasted okay , but subpar . the fish didn ' t flake off and it was dry . the cream sauce wasn ' t bad but you really needed the sauce to make the fish taste good . the sides of potatoes and carrots . i really liked the carrots a lot . it was not soggy and it was fresh , seasoned properly and al dente . it was probably the best dish of the meal that night . the potatoes were definitely whipped but i wasn ' t sure if it was the type of potatoes used or if they used too much butter because the potatoes were dark yellow . probably a combination of both and there was nothing special about it . for dessert , had chocolate chip cookies , N types of ice cream , and N types of sorbet . the cookies were relatively soft in the center and crunchy on the outside . i ' ve had homemade cookies taste better . i didn ' t bother trying the ice cream . the N sorbets i had were the mango , lime , and raspberry . i liked the sorbet except that they were still frozen when they came to the table . overall , great wait staff , crappy food . only thing i will say in their defense is that perhaps the quality of the food suffered because we had a party of about N or so . however , as a customer , i would assume that they would want to put out their best food because they would want us to spread the word about how great this restaurant was . i would not come back here . dine at your own risk . 
i order the general tso chicken from here once a week . i ' ve never ordered food from a chinese restuarant once a week until i found this place . . . my name is l . s . and i ' m addicted to sang kee noodle house ' s general tso chicken . 
i went here because my friend recommended me to try out . i went on a sunday for brunch , the wait wasn ' t that long even though the place was full , the servers were quick and very on to point and moving fast . i tried the la sultan which was very tasty , while my partner tried the banana with neutella ( well , this on can ' t go wrong ) the presentation was great and made me want to try other savory crepes as well . i am glad i tried it out and can ' t wait to go back again ! 
great service and food was delicious , but gave me horrible stomach pains after the meal . i was not alone , i went with N other people and some of them also experienced this . i would try tonys again but maybe try ordering something different . 
we had dinner there last night and it was fabulous ! what a great night out . the food ? amazing . we tried pork belly for the first time , and it was delicious . i had the trout and it was cooked perfectly . the accompanying roasted pepper salsa was so flavorful . my friend had the short ribs and he can ' t stop talking about it . we really wanted to try the fourless chocolate cake for dessert but we just couldn ' t fit one more thing . the portions were perfect . the person saying the portions are small may be speaking of the appetizers , but appetizers are not meant to be huge . if you ' re looking for that , go to chili ' s . if you want quality food , go here . everything was fresh , flavorful , and cooked perfectly . well worth the prices , which were reasonable given the quality of the food and the atmosphere . the waitstaff was fabulous , attentive , friendly , and funny . the manager was hugely attentive , stopping by a few times and even sent us an extra appetizer after we talked about wines for a few minutes . he was hugely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about wines and helped us choose a bottle . maybe these other reviewers had a bad egg waiting on them ? everyone we interacted with was great and only made our experience better . the only reason i ' m not giving the place a full N stars is because they have a few " two-person " booths that are ridiculously small . we were seated in one at first and it was just too cramped . to their credit the second we asked , we were given a new human-sized booth . other than that the space was nice and decorated tastefully with a more modern feel . i would highly recommend this place to anyone . amendment --after dining at the stone hearth N times now , i have to conclude that a lot about your experience here will depend on who ' s waiting on you . i would concur with previous reviews that say the service is inconsistent , or in some cases bad . the Nnd time we ate there we had a waitress who was inattentive and ignored certain requests of ours . it certainly made our night less enjoyable . the waitress on our Nst and Nrd dinners there was absolutely amazing--friendly , attentive , informative--she really made our night . so while the food is absolutely outstanding , know that your experience might be impacted the quality of service depending on which waitress you get . 
this place has the best real new york city pizza ! 
this place looks so inviting from the street , but seriously , keep walking . we had planned to eat somewhere else , but the wait was long , so we decided to get this place a try . first of all , i felt dizzy in there . the set-up of the restaurant is not at all cozy . the decor is too manic or something . i love color and am fine with crazy design , but holy hell . just . no . despite the restaurant being mostly empty on a monday evening , the hostess sat us at one of the tables on the circle around the middle of the restaurant . the table is too small to sit a menu and a drink on at the same time . i literally had to put the menu on my lap when our drinks were delivered to keep from spilling anything . the potato skins are admittedly delicious . but after they were delivered , i found myself asking my dining companion N minutes later whether we were actually going to eat or not . the dining room was empty . there is no excuse for taking N minutes to make two plates of pretty straight-forward food . we got the lemon chicken and a burger . everything was okay . the chicken was overcooked . i guess that ' s what they were using all that downtime for . the chocolate is not noteworthy enough to be the namesake of the whole establishment . it ' s too sweet . i love chocolate . and i ' d still like to try one of their fondues , but i probably won ' t ever go back here unless someone i like really begs me and offers to buy me shit . 
my husband and i saw pat ' s and geno ' s on food network and decided to make a day out of philly and compare them for ourselves . pats lives up to its name , king of steaks . the with , wiz is amazing ! who knew such a simple sub could taste so good . so good in fact that after splitting a sub at pat ' s and geno ' s i made my husband go back and get pats sub for the road . this is a must try place while in philly or even withing a reasonable driving distance ! 
came here about a month ago when it was N degrees out with a party or N . we managed to get the limited seating along the window . was very hot indoors and the ac was on , but the seats on the bench outside were taken ( much more breezy ) . i had a harissa hummus sandwich with a mint ginger lemonade . the sandwich was awesome , the spiciness and dressing was just right . it was good even though the heat might make you loss appetite . it was a little messy for me eating the sandwich , the platter might be better if you like to be more clean . my cousin and friend shared a platter and i took a taste , the platter came with more variety of flavors and sauces . as for the popular mint ginger lemonade , it wasn ' t anything too special to me . the lemonade was refreshing , but was too sweet for me even though i have a sweet tooth . 
never have i waited outside a pizzeria for a slice . however , i will always make an exception for this place . once you enter , you smell the aroma for fresh basil , olive oil , pizza dough , and previous pizzas that left the oven . it ' s so warm and welcoming here with people speaking to each other while waiting , observing the numerous awards throughout the walls , or simply admiring a master pizza maker doing his thing . wait time was ok , i measured from the point i ordered to receiving my order . Nmins . relatively quick . now , if you were further down the line , patience may be tested , but you will be greatly rewarded . i came here for the first time and decided to order the pie ( N ) . delicious ! soft crust and the thinness just right . fresh cheese , basil , and a dollop of olive oil for finishing touches . and it ' s not as if it ' s one pie immediately after the other . the man takes his time observing if the crust is just right and will hold off the next pie if his satisfaction is not met . the crew ( his children ) are friendly and will help get condiments for customers . they pace the orders according to the pizza maker and keep the customers happy . i finished N N slices myself . i couldn ' t resist because the slices are just that exceptional ! goodness , i doubt i can find anywhere else in nyc that can compare to this place . probably have to leave for italy to get a fair comparison . for N a slice , the pie is a better choice . next time , the difara special N for me . ultimately , you will be satisfied . 
i always order from this place before i go home from work . we usually get the sandwiches or the pork chop over rice and spring rolls on the side . food is pretty decent and the price is just right . 
not sure how to review this exactly . the wait wasn ' t too bad at Npm on a thursday . my friend and i hung at the bar while we waited for a third , ordered a few drinks and a round of the pork belly buns . the bartender ended up giving us a second round for free because no one claimed them . that was fabulous , but already was feeling full . the buns were great but momofuku ' s are slightly better ( sorry ! ) . when we were seated we ordered the classic and modern ramen and more buns . the ramen was definitely good , almost too modern clean tasting for my liking . but honestly , as good as the food was , N bowl is not worth it . it ' s just not . you can make pretty great ramen at home for N with an egg and some siracha . so i ' m a little torn . i think it ' s a rip off that could only happen in ny , maybe la , but the food was so good , it ' s hard to complain too much ! 
i had been to this restaurant before it was walia , it was actually called harrer ( more like horror ) . the food then was not at all satisfying . when i heard it was under new ownership i was very eager to give it another shot boy am i glad that i did ! it was a delightful surprise . the food is excellent , very flavorful , and since my first time there i have been back several times . they are very accommodating- in fact you can even call and have gluten free injera ( the bread ) made for you when you come in . the staff is wonderful , they are all very professional . the owner is wonderful as well , once you ' ve been there a few times the treat you like you are practically family . my favorite dish so far would have to be the kitfo and my top choice of sides are the spicy lentil and the mixed greens . they also have wonderful desserts like the home made baklava and home made cheese cake as well as spectacular traditional ethiopian coffee . i definitely recommend giving this place a shot , you will not regret it ! 
i ' ve been occasionally going to black bamboo for a couple years now . the food is decent and the prices used to be good . they recently changed their menu and pricing . i called ahead for two lunch specials ( used to be N . N , now N . N ) and ordered them by number and by name . knowing they changed the numbering , the should have caught that when i said lN , sweet and sour chicken , that i was actually ordering sweet and sour chicken , not the new lN- hunan chicken . . . since i said sweet and sour chicken . i didn ' t have time to go back after returning to the office so i ate what they gave me . i called to let them know people still use older menus and since the number have changed to maybe double check upon ordering since i said the name along with the number . the response i received was , " oh , we changed those awhile ago . " that ' s disappointing . my advice order by name only
one of the oldest bistro in soho and still going strong . a diverse menu and great staff . love the classic french dishes here and a neighborhood gem . 
sushi is good there are other places in the area that i think are a little better but id eat here again . lots on the menu so plenty of reasons to come back and try something different ! 
two delicious entrees , two glasses if wine , a beer and dessert for under N ! will be back ! ! ! 
now this is what i call the most delicious appetizing sandwiches i have ever had . i have been going to lamazou for about a year and i have tried almost every one on their list , it is hard to say which is better than the other . they use the best ingredients , top quality , and my mouth is always drooling in anticipation to digging my teeth into it . . . when you step in there to you feel that you have taken a flight into europe . their shelves are stuffed with great imports from europe , and boy i cannot say enough about their fabulous cheeses which they take care of with love and some they age in their cave . the owners are great and always give me the best recommendations . . . and oh yes their proscuittos , salamis , pates , are exquisite . and if you want party platters this is the place to go . i have also catered their sandwiches for the office and they are the best hit . hats of to lamazou . 
pros great ambience food is spectacular service is great did i say the place was decked out and epic ? loungey lunch specials over the weekend yellow curry fried rice in an omelette cons tofu basil was not great . smelled fish like . i ' m saving the fifth star for consistency . if and when i come back more i will update . 
this place was great . the combination plate had stuffed cabbage , dumplings , pierogies and gulasz ( a stew ) with mashed potatoes corn and carrots . everything was awesome ! 
this is going to be short and sweet . . . . . . i love a place that works wonders with simple ingredients . the gourmet pizzas here are awesome ! i though the dough was spectacular . i ' m not a fan of doughy bready pizza so when our pizza came out , i was drooling even before i even tasted it . we ordered " the joey " sausage pizza and it was simplicity at its best . if you can make a simple pizza topping taste this delicious , i ' m definitely curious to know how all the other pizzas taste ! great atomosphere and friendly staff - me likes ) 
excellent hidden gem above a drive through burger place bar seating plus tables . very good reasonable food , nice ambiance make sure you ' re there when nelson is at the bar he ' s the best ! 
perfect ! had a pepperoni cheese , just great ! come try for yourself . . . 
i ' ve eaten here a handful of times and it has consistently been great . favorite dishes are the fideos , the pumpkin croquettes , the duck hearts , the pan con tomate ( but last time it was way too salty ) the trout is good but again the mushrooms on the top were too salty . try not to sit at the bar as it gets pretty hot . 
i have no preference as to whether i like the regular or sicilian slices because the ingredients are pretty much the same flour , tomato sauce , and cheese . apparently , this place is known for their sicilian pies . i came here yesterday after a fun run in coney island and ordered two regular ( no topping ) sicilian pies . the crust was pretty crispy but was disappointed that it didn ' t have much cheese in general . it looked like they just poured tomato sauce on top and let it be . the slices are pretty thick too so after eating N slices , i was already full . pies are ordered as whole pies only , which means you can ' t do half toppings . they have a decent amount of outdoor seating so perfect for a nice day out . overall , it was an ok place for me . i wouldn ' t say it was the best pizza i had . perhaps a little overrated too . 
this was formerly chuck ' s , where the pizza was lousy . i had a square slice here , and while it was certainly an improvement over chuck ' s it was still average at best . the pie that the slice came from was undercooked , and i had to have it reheated a second time . it still wasn ' t done well enough but i dealt with it . i must add that while the place appeared very clean , i had to brush crumbs off both tables i sat at . there was also no paper of any kind in the rest room . i normally would return to try a round slice , but they did not look all that cheesy so i probably won ' t . N N N they now offer N slices Nam-Npm so maybe i will try it . 
delectable tacos for reasonable prices . highly recommend the fish tacos . the first time i tried them , i was blown away . they literally melt in your mouth . i also think the sweet potato tacos are tasty , and unique ! the guac is also fresh and delish . more than the taste of the food , though , i love the atmosphere . tom has been there every time i ' ve ordered , and he ' s so friendly and helpful . it ' s a cute , intimate shop , and i like it that way . i also still love the truck . and when i ' m lazy , i love that you can get delivery now ! 
you will not find the highest quality fish and the best dining atmosphere at sakura . however , this is the best sushi place for lunch in princeton . its a great deal with two rolls , soup , and a salad . the place is small and crowded , but if you are a regular you get treated very nicely ( with some extra spicy tuna on top ) and the rolls are consistently good . so to sum up , good sized rolls , variety , and a nice soup salad combo to enjoy the sushi with . for the lunch , this is the place to go in princeton . 
lousy services coupled with detestable tasteless foodies at this tourist-favorite , neighbors-shunning bistro . who says it ' s a villagean staple , maybe a snob . 
i ' ve been to cuban pete ' s about N or N times . the place is always very loud . the music is blasting . there is so much running around by the servers and busboys . it ' s not a relaxing place or a place to have a conversation over dinner . we went there because the food was very good except for yesterday . the maduros were so ripe they were like mush and they plopped so much on the plate that we were given very little rice . so , we had to order more rice . the black beans had no sauce . . so we had to ask for more sauce . my daughter ordered the half boneless chicken with cuban mojo . it ' s funny , when they take the bone out you also lose the thight . it ' s to far a ride for the disappointment . won ' t be going baclk . . . . 
i love juniors ! yeah , it ' s touristy and definitely not fancy but that ' s why i love it . there ' s usually never really a wait unless you go on the weekend . i can recommend the grilled chicken sandwich , pastrami reuben , french onion soup , motzo ball soup , potato pancake and strawberry cheesecake . also , don ' t forget to ask for the pickles ( they tend to omit these on the weekends but they can ' t trick this regular ! ! ! ) 
awesome ! ! loved this place ! ! ! ! great food , honest price . lines a bit long . 
checked out this spot on a sunday night around Npm with a few friends . . . . . decor was simple but nice , real comfortable , great aura , people are cool , classic hits on the jukebox , like the cure , billy idol , michael jackson etc . . . . . . and the pricing is not bad . . . . . we had about N miller high lifes , a burger and fries , came out to about N dollars . . . . . food was tasty , only thing that sucked was that the burger was listed at N dollars which comes with no fries just the burger alone , fries will cost another N , so a burger deluxe there is about N dollars which is not cheap . . . . but overall i had a good time , most likely would head back there and just stay away from the food menu . 
absolutely delicious . food took a while to come out . but the chicken pad suew was delicious . the texture of the noodle was cooked just right . and the dish is not greasy like most of the thai places i ' ve tried . lunch special comes with soup or salad and a choice of spring roll , dumplings or net roll . the net roll was super crunchy ! the veg tofu soup was light and healthy . all for N
when i was a senior in highschool , a classmate raved about this place like nobody ' s business . finally when i was a freshman in highschool . i actually found myself with free time and a couple of friends that wanted to stop in . the place is tiny . without a doubt . small small small . when we stepped in it wasn ' t that crowded but in a group of three , we still found it slightly hard to maneuver . the dude behind the counter saw us looking overwhelmed and invited us to try a sample . and when i say sample , he literally gave us a bunch of fries and every sauce . we were so grateful ! ! it was hard but he helped us pick our three flavour sauces . we had to wait a little bit for a table , but we got one and began to enjoy our fries . the tables have holes in them so you can stick the cone shaped fry dispenser . it ' s pretty nifty . i wouldn ' t suggest coming here for a actually dinner date . but casual friend meeting . or simply stepping in for a treat . yeah . totally . i like this place , a lot ! this place is a must go for a unique experience . 
some months ago i had a negative service experience at garces trading company . i spoke to the regional manager about the experience and that i am a frequent customer . i brought a close friend visiter from dc . we were both disappointed . the regional manager graciously apologized and offered to make up for it next time my friend comes in . tonight we dined at gtc and everything was spectacular . we had a great salad and great house-made mozzarella . then we had short ribs and scallops . . . and duck fries for " dessert " . thank you to the regional manager for her generosity and to our waiter nathaniel who wisely recommended our food . once again i love this place , and so does my visiting friend . thank you again . michael silverman
didn ' t like the service nor the pizza . had to repeat my order N times for anyone to understand these people need to learn english
very good happy hour . there is not much like it around . the only thing missing is people . sliders were great , marintinis good enough . 
brought my son to this restaurant to try something new . it was a risk since they only had one vegetarian sandwich on the menu , but he enjoyed it . the veggies looked fresh and the service was good . look forward to returning . 
better than dominoes when you have a big group of kids to feed and they deliver . not for me but fine for them and cheaper than a digornio . 
filet mignon with grilled artichokes , and the whiskey cake for dessert . just as the dishes were godly , so were the waiters , and the entire experience as a whole . 
i went here with my boyfriend in the middle of july . we ' re both from around the area and we wanted to try something new so off to yelp we went ! and boy , did we make the right choice . we ordered the chef ' s sampling ( which they say is four courses but we got more like N or N plates ) . don ' t be too hasty to eat all of the ( heavenly duck fat and sea salt ) bread if the food looks a little small at first by the time dessert rolled around i was so pleasantly stuffed that i didn ' t think i could eat another bite ( but there was chocolate so . . . ) the waiters were extremely friendly , professional , and accommodating . they were careful to listen to my likes dislikes and allergies and they explained every bit of every course . my water glass was never empty yet they never felt overbearing . the food was some of the best in nyc . i will certainly be returning . if you have a little extra cash to spend , i recommend vitae-you won ' t be disappointed ! 
friendly staff with great food and wine in an otherwise very low key town . wasn ' t super busy but i really enjoyed a relaxing evening here . 
seriously ? ! ugh ! after reading all the good reviews , i decided to give this place a try . obviously , greenwich village hillbillies don ' t know what a true falafel tastes like ! N bucks for half a falafel sandwich ! that ' s more evil than paying N for a slice of pizza . the falafel itself was cracked and way tooooo crispy . i felt as if i was eating chips . instead of israeli salad , they put lettuce in their pita bread ! this place is tiny and there is no place for you to turn or move once inside . i am giving it one star because the pita bread was warm and sort of crispy too . if you love falafels , go there , you " ll hate it . 
great lunch spot if you work in the area - lots of space . the food actually tastes quite good and they comes fairly quickly . the spinich dip is delicious ! ! ! just wish the restaurant had a little more personality . . . 
first off , so glad that places like this exist . for those who only want to put real food into their bodies , this is a great spot to have around . i am , however , a little surprised that they used ice in my N juice . really ? the juice is small enough and they ' re watering it down with ice ? i ' m okay with paying a premium for high quality food items . . . . but i ' m not okay paying a premium for watered-down high quality food . in my experience , it ' s not " the norm " to put ice in juice . i ' d prefer my juice to be room temperature ( like normal ) , anyway , and got a headache from drinking it cold . wish they would have asked . 
came here on a wednesday night around N Npm with a few former coworkers for dinner ( group of N ) and cranked open a few wine bottles we brought with us . the space is a modern yet rustic look and doesnt feel like a pizzeria . . if anything it looks and feels more like a restaurant . right away we were greeted by a pleasant and lovely girl who seated us right away . we started with appetizers and ordered the eggplant rolatini and the antipasti salad for N with extra meat and cheese . in addition to this a complimentary basket of toasted warm bread was served with a balsamic and olive oil dipping sauce . all was very good and plentiful - the servings were extremely generous . for entrees we all ordered the chicken parm and it was all thanks to the owners walking over and greeting us and giving us their recommendation . the chicken parm was served with our choice of pasta in various sauces . we all went with the penne pasta in a home made vodka sauce . . it was delicious and very very filling . the chicken was very tender with a crispy outside in with lots of cheeses and just the right amount of tomato sauce . for dessert we shared the last slice of cheesecake the restaurant had along with our coffees . it was delicious and i ' m not a cheesecake fan but this was the perfect balance of sweet and salty . we also received complimentary shots of sambuca with our coffee which was very nice of the owners to do . the best part among the great service and delicious food ? the prices . . they are well priced for the area and wont break the bank , especially with the byob concept . i will def come back here again and recommend this place to my friends and family . we got a winner ! ! -d
i had a lovely experience at kitchen zinc several nights ago , where i was joined by several friends for a small meal after the yale founders ' day events . the setting is nice but not fabulous we chose to be seated outside and we were seated at one of the metal tables ( very " average patio furniture " -esque ) . but it was a lovely evening , so we enjoyed the weather . the service was good , and our waitress was very patient with us ( as we deliberated on what to eat for a while ) . i was a bit surprised that the water served was not chilled or served over ice , but it ' s not a big deal . i shared the fig speck pizza , which wes delicious ! it wonderfully combined the sweetness of fig , smoky and savory flavours of speck , creaminess of the cheese , and earthy freshness of the arugula . verdict i would definitely return to re-order the fig speck pizza and to try other items on their intriguing menu . 
had our annual quiet nye dinner here and definitely had a nice time . this space has been several bar restaurants over the years , but this is the best of the bunch , imo . we had steak and frites , with a nice cut of steak and perfectly cooked . the service was good considering the large crowd and people were genuinely having a nice time . price point was very reasonable for the quality . there ' s a football feel to the place with a couple of tvs , but it wasnt too casual . the sports focus just seemed incidental , although it would be a nice place to eat and watch a game . this would be a solid choice for dinner at anytime . 
yummer i love this place . i am vegetarian and they only have one vegetarian sandwich - the cauliflower - but it is so good . sometimes they have specials seasonal selections though so i shouldn ' t say they have only one . good sauce , love the veggies , only slightly spicy , and delicious bread . despite the line , the sandwich is always out quickly . i crave their sandwiches . if i keep coming back a place really deserves N stars . 
N stars from me because of the prices-although i felt like i was stalking people with half-empty plates for their seats , then hovering over them with a look on my face that read " are you almost done ? are you getting up soon ? hurry up please i want your seat ! " then when they get up me and a few other people are rushing to get to the chair like children playing musical chairs ! ha ! i won this round ! the pork and chive fried dumplings were delish , i also got the chicken steam dumpling but not a fan . miso soup was hearty and yummy , unlike other places that give you one piece of tofu , there is lots of it along with wakame ( seaweed ) . best bet is to take out , but bring cash because they don ' t accept anything but . 
not a bad little spot to hang out and grab a margarita . the corn is great and the sandwiches are not bad either . the patio area outside is nice to hang out on a spring afternoon . 
went there last night and got wings to go . the girl said they are known for their wings . hopefully it was an off night . the wings were terrible ! im used to charlies wings down the shore . the wings had no sauce on them and i did not order them that way , when i woke up in the morning the sauce in the container had about N N red sauce on the bottom and rest was orange hard fat on the top . , sorry wont be getting wings there again . 
love this place ! ! ! ! had a blast and have gone a few times . the chicken is fried perfectly , every time i ' ve gone , and the sides were plentiful . the ambiance was kind of hipster chic , not my taste really , but the food warrants N out of N alone ! service with a smile , and the pies are great too , and that ' s saying something since i ' m picky about pie lol
i have been going to cafe cluny for years . the restaurant is located in the most idyllic corner of w Nth and w Nth in the west village . the food and service is consistent , and the ambiance is both chic and comfortable . last night , i was there with a party of N at N N . we made reservations ahead of time , and we were seated as soon as everyone arrived . we ordered the fresh mozzarella , the grilled lettuce and artichokes to start . for entrees , the pork loin , the chicken , the scallops , and the steak special . all were delicious , though the pork won out while the scallop dish left you wanting more as there were only N pieces . for dessert , we had the almond tart , the chocolate torte , and the profiteroles . while the profiteroles and almond tart where perfectly executed , the chocolate torte really stole the show . all the dishes are great , but i would recommend starting with the seared yellowtail ( which i had for lunch last week ) , moving on to the pork for your entree , and then finishing it up with the chocolate torte . N stars for atmosphere , food , and service . 
great italian food and great pizza . anytime my family wants italian , we always go to fortes . i love the pesto and the garlic knobs . 
great soup . has plenty of potential . i will definitely go back again . 
awesome and totally addictive ! the sandwiches are fantastic and i am a lover of a good vietnamese sandwich . really fresh tasting and incredibly flavorful . . . as they should be . and the owner and the staff are really nice and make it a pleasure to go in anytime . 
i have to say we got an amazing waiter for our brunch date with our friends . there were five of us . one ordered the grilled lamb burger to ordered the grilled vegetable burger one ordered the french toast and i ordered the pesto scrambled eggs . the lamb burger was absolutely delicious very moist and very juicy . the vegetable burgers were also very great one of the best i ' ve ever tasted . my eggs were completely heavenly i just could not stop eating them . they also gave me a side of garlic aeolian which was amazing . definitely you try their avocado toast it was really good . the french toast was also perfectly sweet and yummy . i highly suggest this restaurant . as for the drinks they were perfectly made and the waiter was perfect and giving us suggestions of what each of each one of us like personally . you have to at least try this restaurant once in your lifetime it should give you a grade taste of food that you require for a brunch . 
the pizza melts in your mouth . i love it . the cheese is hot and drips off the slice . i go twice a week . 
paisano ' s appears to cater to large groups ( i . e . N ) vs . dates or " dinner for two " . in the later case you may not be served in a timely manner and even ignored if there are tables with more people . if groups arriving after you possess more people ( i . e . N ) , they will serve the later arrivals ( because they are larger parties which means more gratuity ) . some of the staff ( esp . the young female waitress ) are completely ignorant and outright disrespectful . it ' s comes across as a ' put on ' there . i ' ll never be going there again . you ' ll get much better service and respect just down the street at eros caf . if you really want italian and exceptional service go to sergio ' s over in lodi . 
best place for vegan brunch in brooklyn , hands down . 
food is delicious and fresh . we had a reservation and were seated right away . the cocktails were amazing as well was the service . it ' s a little pricey but worth it . the decor is rustic and cozy . 
the best pizza anywhere . nice and thin with a crisp crust . it is a tight fit in the seating area and if you have a problem being close to the couple next to you then order a pizza to go . a little known delicacy of this place is the calzone . it also rocks . 
we have eaten at this restaurant many times for work and personal meals--have a great brunch ! however , at dinner tonight , we had a relatively disappointing meal . food was ok , slightly overcooked lamb but there was plastic in the spinach . when we pointed this out the manager , he had the nerve to say this happens sometimes--really , this is your idea of customer service ! at the very least you should have provided a new entree . i can tell you this will make me think twice before going here again
one of the few middle eastern places open for weekday lunch in the area my wife and i dropped in on a hot and humid monday afternoon . the owner made us up two cold plates . kale salad with chicken and a plate of carrot salad with falafel and hummus . i am still thinking about it two days later . it was a simple but terrific meal ! fresh and flavorful in ample array , i will be back soon . 
ok we order from here alot this last time we ordered the rude girl on the phone did not add the coupon in we told her about N times . . . then i order cheese fries they deliever the food no cheese for the fries . . we call and tell them they say were sending someone right out . . . half hour later still nothing . . . we did order N . N worth of food we call back asking where is the cheese we ordered the girl puts some guy on the phone who says i have my guys all over the place right now . . . really we ordered like N hours ago and ur telling us that ur drivers are busy then he asks if we wanna pick it up ! ! no ! ! we paid for our food to be delivered and still they havent refunded my money like they said they would ! ! use to love this place now never again they are over priced rude and have no idea how to treat their customers when theres a problem . . . and they need to get rid of the miserable girl on the phone if u dont wanna hornor ur coupons then dont send them out ! ! ! from now on were odering from capital pizza or stellas ! ! ! and were still waiting on them to refund my money for the cheese fries and the money they over charged me and still havent heard anything from them the foods good if u eat there i use to get their chicken parm until the chicken parm was rubbery . . . never again they have the cockiest girls working there owner doesnt understand a thing u say to him he just agrees with everything u say . . . miss the old owners ! ! ! and i will pass this on to all my friends and family in the area along with all the girls i work with and thats alot considering i work for someone who owns N huge salons . . ive worked in retail and customer service for years and at antonios with the new owners they are rude and do not care about their customers at all ! ! ! my days of giving them N . N-N . N for their over priced food that isnt worth it at all anymore and my days of eating their cold soggy food when delievered over over . . teamfrankos capitalpizza stellas
ok so i lied , i ' ve eaten here at least N times since this annoying incident . i love their food , my favorite is the wontons in chili oil and the shrimp dry pot . notable mentions are the house special fried rice . 
this is the best shabu shabu in nyc ! always fresh vegetables and high quality meat . the place is a bit small but it ' s not necessarily a bad thing . great selection on the menu , great service , and intimate atmosphere . they also have some decent happy hour specials . you can only make a reservation with a party of N or more and cause there seems to always be a long line for dinner . best advice- get there for an early dinner , otherwise you ' ll have to patiently wait like everyone else ( but def worth it ) . at least they have bench outside . . . or just wander about the east village . . . 
cute atmosphere . neighborhood service . great beer , wine and food . looks like upstate has just opened . it was packed last night when i was there . small cozy place that is very comfortable . great selection of unusual draft beers and wines . no menu yet , but the knowledgeable staff makes a menu unnecessary . mostly fresh seafood , with interesting presentations and wonderful flavors . go for the oysters . it still needs a sign , but you can not miss it , right next door to an indian place that has more christmas lights than the tree at rockefeller center . i will go back . maybe become a regular . 
this place rocks , fast service , great atmosphere , excellent food ! 
i would give it N star if yelp allows me to do that . it was awful . we browsed through all those rave reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try . my boyfriend had grilled octopus for appetizer , but unfortunately it tasted like chicken . i just can ' t imagine how they did that , since octopus was supposed to be tender and kinda sleek . . . the special pasta entree with mussels and cherry tomatoes and basil was okay . veal francese was okay too . what was really annoying was the smoke from the kitchen . it was everywhere . we could not even smell the dishes and it made our noses uncomfortable , so we just skipped the dessert . will not come here again ! 
amazing brunch ! creative , delicious , and a fantastic staff of family members . will definitely be back from la for this one ! 
burmese food has influences from india ( curry and lentil dishes ) , china ( stir fries , noodles , spring rolls ) and thailand ( spicy , sweet and sour coconut milk and tamarind sauces ) but still retains unique preparation techniques and flavors . rangoon makes some concession to the local palate , but nevertheless serves a flavorful meal . the dishes say " hot and spicy " , but the taste usually remains mild . given the adjustments , rangoon enjoys an eclectic clientele and as a result is usually packed . servers are somewhat strained , and while service levels are adequate they are not exceptional . you could do well by starting with the thousand layer bread with curry chicken or potato dip . inspired from the indian paratha , variants are also present in malay food . the string bean or ginger salads ( both with sesame seeds ) are also popular . in entrees , you have a number of excellent options in chicken . i ' ve really liked the chicken qeema ( sauteed , minced chicken over homemade bread ) chili chicken ( crispy , diced chicken with bell peppers and onions ) which is spicy , but different from the chinese version of the dish chicken mint kebab ( marinated chicken ) --- all are delicious . vegetarians should enjoy the mango tofu and the tomato curry tofu . the noodle dishes are uniformly well made , but the seafood doesn ' t deliver consistently . frankly , there ' s no real reason to try desserts in a cuisine originating east of india . rangoon serves an interesting faluda rose water , milk , jelly , tapioca pearls with vanilla ice cream . but , why stuff yourself when you could instead savor the wonders of capogiro or scoop de ville ? 
amazing brunch and really nice staff ! 
location a bit of a trek . they ' ve got a nice smart casual ambience . big enough place that you can come here with a group . also , a great option on weekends when everywhere else is booked solid - i can always find a table here . food okay , here ' s the deal - the food is great , provided you order the right things . brunch here is a disappointment . lunch is fine but lack selection - dinner is your best bet . the more unique protein selection ( e . g . rabbit , quail etc . . . ) tend to be great options . the salads , oysters , grilled octopus are fantastic as well . pasta and fish tend to get into the iffy territory - the past few times i ordered hadn ' t been so great . desserts are fine but not great - i would skip it and order some wine instead . i ' m a bit miffed that you have to pay N for N N loaf of bread . don ' t get me wrong - it ' s great bread but for N you could at least give me a whole loaf . i can do without N kinds of butter . service service is okay . nothing to really complain about but some servers tend give a stand-offish impression . try looking for reyna if she ' s working , she ' s always fun . price expect to spend a fair amount of dough in this joint . dinner could easily be N including drinks but no dessert . overall a good , solid place to eat . smart casual ambience with fine service . could be pricey . usually have seats during the weekends . a bit of a trek . however , the press lounge has great views and they ' re really near sullivan street bakery ( which has great bread ) . 
overall the food is very good and the drinks as well . the staff is very good too . i remember being greeded by nichole whom may be the manager . i only say this because she is knowledgeable , professionable , and friendly . well if if she is not the manager she should be , anyway i enjoyed my visit because of her and the other employees . 
best chinese food near belleville- fresh , delicious and awesome food . very nice manager too ! 
this is my favorite restaurant ! ! ! i ' ve been to a lot of thai vietnamese restaurant before but thai awesome has the best food not to mention great food and presentation quality for such an affordable price ! they have fast and really good service too . i usually go during the lunch time and always order their lunch combo for only N . N ! ! ! i always get chicken red curry and it comes with rice , soup , salad and a siam roll . . and for that price , its a great deal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! my friends and i go there so much that the last time i went , they gave us free desserts . i just love this restaurant . its really a must ! 
i took my out of town brother here for a relaxing sunday dinner . there are half price quesadillas and tacitos and N margaritas on sunday nights . ( note that the tacitos are not the rolled up tacos , but rather small tacos ) . he actually had a mojito as we were told by my friend ( and foursquare folks ) that they are the best mojitos in the east village . i loved that they came with a stick of suger cane -- super fun to chew on . we got chicken quesadillas which we awesome . i think the chicken was chipotle chicken . there was dif a spicy kick to htem which i loved . a huge glob of yummy guacamole was also a welcome addition to the quesadillas . the shrimp tacos were terrific . the corn salsa was very present . yuca fries were also awesome . there was a garlic-y and cilantro ( ? ) spread on top which was nice to dip them in to . since we ordered dinner , we were able to sit outside and people watch along ave a . it was a really nice and relaxing night . i would def bring more out of town people here on an off night ( since it is rather expensive ) . the food and drinks are delicious and it ' s in a new york neighborhood most out-of-towners would not really get to . 
disappointment . the staff was at best unwelcoming and at worst incompetent . the wait , despite a reservation , was ridiculous , especially considering we had a wheelchair- bound person in our party . but that was perhaps the problem , as opa clearly had no experience nor interest in accomodating the disabled . when we finally were seated , we heard the hostess apologize to the next table she sat that she was sorry for the wait which was due to issues with a handicapped customer . passable food does not overcome such shoddy service or unfriendly atmosphere . 
let me first say that i have been to this place N times . so obviously i do like the food . i think the way that they take the tastes of the philippines and repackage it into a creative dish intrigues me . of the N time i have been to this place the chef has lost our order ticket twice . on both occasions they did recognize their mistake and gave us free drinks or desert to make amends . the place gets packed especially on the weekends and they only take cash . . . . my fave dish that they serve is the chori-burger . i dont know what they put in it but damn it tastes good . as a few other have stated , the price of the food is expensive . and it is ! ! the chori burger with and egg comes out be be a N . N philippine burger . ouch . they do serve filipino food with flair and you are definitely paying a premium for that . is it worth it ? you be the judge . 
i think this could be a good restaurant , but i think it missed the mark . the atmosphere is wonderful , except that it is very cramped . i thought the loud people behind us were sitting with us . we ordered the calamari appetizer which was too salty to eat . then i ordered the grouper chef style and couldn ' t eat but one piece and had to literally guzzle a pitcher of water i was so full of salt . they salt everything to the hilt to try and add flavor all it accomplishes is a thirst behind comprehension . i would never go back although i love the pineapple on the ridizio at the end of the night . 
good , but not great pizza . went there on a friday based on the number of yelp reviews and i found the pizza tasty , but not really worthy of all the praise . there are so many other great pizza places around town ( gruppo , lombardi ' s , john ' s , patsy ' s ) , so unless you are right on that block and or looking to mix things up from your usual pizza joints , it ' s not really a " must eat at " place . on the plus side , they do have excellent fast service , fairly good inexpensive house wine ( N for red or white ) and the furniture nailed up on the ceiling is a nice touch . 
i ' m now a flight attendant but mainly live in newark . . newark has awesome food but it can get boring cuz it ' s all spanish portuguese food ! this diner has always been my " to go " place for food . . breakfast , lunch , dinner and even late night ! love me the spanish skillet omelet with cheese and sweet potato fries ! great food and down to earth folks ! 
michael ' s salumeria is hands down delicious ! ! i ' ve been there a few times during lunch and not only is the food delicious , but the staff is super friendly and helpful ! my experience with them went on a whole other level when my husband ordered catering from them for my Nth birthday party ! food is one of the most important pieces to a party and michaels salumeria went over and above with their catering ! not only is their presentation super fabulous , but the food was sooo good ! ! everyone kept saying how delicious the food was and kept asking where it was from ! it was so delicious that everyone wanted the left overs for breakfast the next day ! ! i highly recommend this restaurant for your next party ! ! and p . s . order the italian mac and cheese if you want your mind blown ! 
for the visit here , we bought four cheesecakes to go . N of the white chocolate raspberry truffle , N of the banana cream , and N original cheesecake . it costed about N ! ! ! way too expensive ! that ' s why they do not get N stars from me . i know that the cheesecakes taste so divine , but they could get more business if they ' d lower the price . i know that i would make a lot more visits to cheesecake factory for their cheesecakes , if they would lower it by a couple of dollars . instead , i ' ll only go to one of their locations about three times a year instead of three times a month because they are too expensive ! just a suggestion from one of your " thrifty " fans . 
great ramen for me personally not worth the wait as a local . i would recommend it if you do not live in the neighborhood and have about an hour to waste . 
my friend at work is part mexican and when he told me this was better than chipotle and qdoba i didn ' t believe him , but man was i wrong . their beans are great , the steak is the best , and the cheese in their burritos and quesadillas is well-distributed . unlike other burrito places , dt does a great job at making sure every bite has every ingredient you asked for . again , steak burrito . 
the tap room never ever lets me down . the food is as good as it gets , service spot on . i just love this place . it ' s casual and the food is always amazing . the room itself is my idea of what a new york city restaurant should be elegant , relaxed , never stuffy or unwelcoming . mile high windows bring in the excitement of the whole high line thing but without fighting the crowds . i eat here a lot . the management is kind enough to hold our favorite table by the window . that ' s kind of how the whole place rolls . hospitality a priority . 
this review is strictly brunch only . this place is on the money . . and with N michelin star under their belt , it ' s not hard to understand why . once i stepped into the restaurant , i immediately fell in love . the wall was filled with cortland apples . . . the scent of sweetness permeated the air . . . and then right there , i knew i was in for one special treat . we opted for the five course tasting menu . . . . amuse bouche - watermelon soup big eye tuna - green apple , bergamot , osetra caviar porcini flan - alaska live dungeness crab , black truffle dashi slow braised kobe style beef cheeks - blue kale gnocchi caramelized anjou pear w valrhona chocolate , biscuit breton , hot toffee sauce lemon verbena and tahitian vanilla ice cream everything was delicious , beautifully presented and my favorite part ? ? ? the bread man . yes , the bread man . this guy had a cart filled with different kinds of bread . . . i couldn ' t decide , so i picked three different kinds . and because it was my birthday , he wrapped up a whole loaf of bread for me , to go . 
this has been my favorite sicilian style pizza since my childhood and i love it the same every time i return . their pizza has been featured on man v . food and is really just excellent . their square is thick , crunchy on the bottom , mushy on top and they put the sauce over the mozzarella and then sprinkle with parmesan . the sauce is hearty and sweet , just the way i like it . it is great ( and packed ) in the summer because they have a huge outdoor seating area . it is pretty hard to park around here ( you will notice the double parked cars , motorcycles and usually at least one cop car-because the cops around here know where it ' s at-and it ' s not the dunkin donuts down the block ) . it is still decently priced and retains its neighborhood feel , even though people from all over brooklyn come here . and the slice ? please don ' t come here if you are ordering a round neapolitan slice . there are plenty of places to go for that . if you want a hefty , filling saucy square then you need look no further . the hardest part is always saving room for spumoni and ices . l b is also known for it ' s spumoni so make sure to try . the traditional spumoni is ' rainbow ' but not the red , white and blue kind . this is creamy gelato , pistachio and chocolate . i can ' t wait to go back and although i don ' t live as close as i did as a kid , i make sure i take my annual summer excursion here . 
i visited bar this week for the first time with some friends who insisted i had to come try the mashed potato pizza and it did not disappoint . food was tremendous and the service was good . no complaints from this customer . 
tonight , i found my muse and his name is domenico demarco . dom - as his friends call him - is a kindly old man uncanily reminiscent of pinocchio ' s father , geppetto . only instead of carving life out of wood , domenico creates magic out of flour , water and the finest ingredients on the other side of the atlantic buffalo mozzarella mixed in with two other cheeses ( all imported from italy ) , fresh tomatoes , basil leaves cut straight from the plant . this adorable N year-old pizzartisan stretches the dough old school , splatters the tomato sauce , and hand grates the mozza on to the crust before drizzling fresh olive oil on top . every few minutes , he opens the fiery oven door and reaches his arm inside , finger testing the dough . once baked to perfection , he grabs the piping hot product with his two bare hands , lifting them on to a plate . ( no , the man can ' t be human ) the product ? none other than one of the best meals of my N ( count ' em ) years . pure heaven in a bite . sumptious dollops of onions , mushrooms , sausage and cheese on a thin crust cooked so well that it never once bent . yes , the crust stood its cantilevered ground . this once-in-a-lifetime delight made lucali , grimaldi ' s and pepe ' s seem like domino ' s , pizza hut and papa johns . most importantly of all , domenico has stayed incorruptible , maintaining his integrity over the years . despite all the accolades - N pizza in this magazine or that guidebook - his ego has not swollen , as he humbly and quietly creates his art , everyday ( but mondays ) from noon til N . 
i tried again to give these guys a chance . . i called to see how late they deliver ( because in the past they sometimes don ' t answer the phone ) . someone answered the phone by coughing . . ( okay , that happens i guess ) , i politely ask my question . he says nothing and puts me on hold ( kinda rude , but okay . . ) another guy comes on the line and asks what i need . i ask how late they deliver . the guy says N pm . . i say thank you , and he just hangs up . that was enough to not order . . if they can ' t even answer the phone and ask like a business . i have no idea how they stay in business . 
there aren ' t a lot of places in the area i enjoy eating but this is definitely one of them . the pricing is good . the food is good . 
good ass pizza . expensive , but good . just do it , now . eat it . you ' ll like it . 
lovely little restaurant in my new hood . came here on a wednesday night on a date , place was a little quiet and service was appropriately attentive . as the space filled in with lively ( probably ) regulars , the atmosphere changed but in the good way ! my food was delicious- we shared the grilled octopus salad and i had the eggplant with ricotta as an entree . our wine was well-priced and excellent . while we were sipping on the last bit of our bottle , our server approached us about moving to another table so he could seat a large party who had arrived . instead of rushing us out of the restaurant by dropping the bill , he kindly offered to buy us dessert . not one to squabble over free dessert , we cheerfully moved to another table and enjoyed a delicious chocolate lava cake ! i ' ll be back , for sure . . . 
bobby ' s burger palace is the go-to spot for a bangin ' burger and fries . i personally have gotten the topless burger ( any burger put over spring mix salad rather than a bun ) and the bobby bleu burger , crunchified . when i got the topless burger , i got the california and it was delicious and fresh - it ' s the perfect light meal . the bobby bleu is another story . it ' s piled high with toppings ( especially when crunchified ) and the bacon bleu cheese combination is perfect . jeff was a huge fan of the philadelphia burger and raved about it quite a bit . he regretted getting his burger crunchified ( i . e . with the standard lay potato chip on top ) . really , crunchifying isn ' t all that and a bag of chips ( pun intended ) . the condiments are great . i ' m a huge fan of the chipotle ketchup . the burgers aren ' t really that big either - you get more toppings than you get actual meat . the fries are mediocre and a la carte . so while the price of the burger seems reasonable ( around N N a burger ) that includes only the burger , so it ' s not really a deal . then , an order of fries includes only a few of them , and they really aren ' t all that good . to me , they didn ' t seem fresh , neither did the buns ( however , jeff says his bun was delicious ) . the sauce that comes with the fries was not very flavorful at all . overall , go for the burgers , not the fries . we also got a black and white milkshake - also not extremely impressive . it was a little too sweet and it ' s a pretty small milkshake for the ( roughly ) N price . in sum , we were happy when we left . 
bought N combo packs boneless wings ( includes fries ) . not one good french fry in any of these overpriced packs . the french fries were the most disgusting , fat and grease-soaked fries i have ever seen . wings were just ok . will not go back- totally not worth the ! ! 
i went to gallos this afternoon and thought it was so good i would write about it . it is a small family owned place . the owner server head chef cashier was great . his english was very good and no one should feel intimidated going there not speaking spanish . the food was spectacular . torta de pollo milanesa , was great . huge and delicious . the chicken is often dried out at other places , not here . the beef tacos , good . simple , but if you wanted extra toppings just ask . just walk in past the convenience store part and find a table in the back . they deliver , the food came out quickly and was great . i will eat here on a regular basis . lunch for two under N bucks . worth a trip down south . 
as far as greek restaurants go in new york , kefi excels in the category of food , but not ambiance and atmosphere . the food is fantastic . well done and rather authentic as greek food goes . the presentation is nice and the portions will definitely leave you full . however , if a true , greek atmosphere is what you look for , i ' d highly recommend heading over to astoria . kefi is more of a " sleeker " style restaurant and not your more ethnic style spot . then again , like any restaurant , the focal point should be the food and they know it here . their food speaks for itself . the real drawback here is the staff . they know they ' re good and act like it . thats the reason not to rate them higher . the staff is rude and the service is lacking , almost like they ' re doing you a favor . definitely worth the trip for the food , just don ' t be scared off by the poor service and the way you ' re treated . 
menu is tiny , space is tiny , employee charm is tiny , bahn mis are banging . also , they close at like Npm ( N N delivery cutoff ! ? ! ! ) which seems wild for a restaurant of any kind in nyc , i think if they were open until N , N , N they would still get tons of business . 
who doesn ' t love this place ? best during off hours when it ' s quiet . everything is delicious ! go ! 
great , fun atmosphere with friendly staff . . . and the drag queens are the best ! highly recommended . 
first spaghetti and meat balls you can get anywhere , so if that ' s your taste this is not the place . let us begin with the appetizers fried asparagus in an obscene butter sauce , sauteed escarole and or spinach , mussels in red or white sauce , or as we say here in philly gravy . moving on to the main courses a veal chop to die for , lobster francaise and chicken sicilian just to name a few of our favorites , however , the other menu selection ' s expose some real hidden treasures . combine all this with the excellent wait staff and a good chianti and this is the reason my wife and i travel to N south Nth street from fenwick island delaware to experience a true taste of italy . 
charlie may have been a sinner , but he did one thing right by lending his name to this dark and sexy spot on Nth . surely that must count for some type of penance ? i arrived at a lucky moment when there was a single open table in an otherwise packed establishment . but it was by the window , on a slightly chilly evening . i soon found out my luck was on a roll when a second table opened up at the nearby banquette , a perfect spot for a drink and a few bites . since i was not planning on drinking ( even the sinners need a break now and then ) , i was happy to see a handful of mocktails . the raspberry ginger club soda concoction was served on ice and just the right amount of sweet . my companion and i shared several plates - everything on the menu is vegan . we had the little hot dogs , the chickpea fries , saffron artichokes and confit potato cup with mushrooms . i thought the artichokes were super boring there just wasn ' t anything remotely special about them . as a carnivore , the hot dogs didn ' t do it for me . the chickpea fries were a nice bite and i liked that they didn ' t come across as super heavy . it took a while for the potato and mushroom dish to come out but it was totally worth the wait - the plate was super flavorful and had a great mix of textures . i will absolutely order that on my next visit . we finished off with the apple fritters , which are basically tempura apple slices served with a side of melted chocolate . i personally think caramel or butterscotch would have been a better partner but it was a solid sweet ending . stock that booze , charlie . next time , i ' m coming in thirsty . 
ok
had a family day here for a party of N . wow , just wow . is a foodies dream . they can really cook mediterranean . my wife had the grilled mixed meat plate which was out of this world . meats were tender , seasoned and cooked to perfection . i had the gyro , again it was outstanding . on top of that it ' s a family run restaurant and they ' re very warm and inviting . i felt like i was eating in the home of a family friend . will definitely be coming back , it ' s a hidden gem . p . s . , its byob . another plus . 
this was hands down my favorite restaurant in new york city for years , the atmosphere was awesome , watching the chefs was so cool , the food was creative and delicious and the service was impeccable , all at a reasonable price for a high class restaurant . unfortunately , the head chef westley has left and things have changed . the food isn ' t as good and the service is down . i will admit the bar is very high and it ' s still a great place , but i miss the way it used to be . 
i can ' t say anything bad about this food ! the chicken is probably the most flavorful chicken i have ever had and i would totally recommend it to anyone who has never been here before . also the ceviche was great and had big pieces of fish . the sangria was perfect and quite boozy ! the only cons was that food service was slow and it was really loud . 
my wife and i decided to try mamma flora ' s since we live in the area and have never been there . we had the anti pasta for two as an appetizer . we then had the lasagna and penne bolognese for entrees . the food was tremendous . great portions and great taste . the server , matt , couldn ' t have given better service . he was friendly as well as knowledgeable about the menu . he timed the service perfectly and was never pushy or overbearing . this is not N star dining but i am giving it N stars because the food and service were great and reasonably priced . also , the place was clean - very important . we ' ll be back . 
excellent food and portion sizes . left very happy . had the goat neck ( tons of rich delicious meat ) , spare ribs ( great dry rub , fall-off-the-bone tender , and again very meaty and not too fatty ) , collard greens ( delicious , perfectly seasoned ) and the soup ( very tasty , like a thai tom yum sort of broth ) . will definitely return ! 
i love this place . they consistently deliver great queso , nachos , tacos , and margaritas . what more could you want ? i love the fact that they have a sense of humor about their food , too . i lived in austin for N years , and this place is the closest i can come to recreating that vibe in nyc . 
let me start with saying that the food was excellent . we came , N of us , for sunday brunch . i had the poached lobster with potato ravioli . the lobster was soft and sweet and just perfect . actually , every thing that i tasted from my friends ( and i tastes a few things ) was just delicious . my only complaint is with the service . our waitress was terrible , she seamed inexperienced and unhappy . she didn ' t smile once and i really wouldn ' t care about that , if she only did her job well . it took forever for the food to arrive . we had to call her over to take our drink orders and then our dessert order . the coffee arrived cold and when asked to replace it she said " of course " and never came back . we had to ask one of the bus boys . maybe it had something to do with the fact that they automatically charged a N tip to the bill so she really had no reason to work to hard . a restaurant of that caliber should really have better service . 
as an area resident i happen to find myself in essex green for a variety of reasons most days out of the week . when i ' m feeling the need for a bite while in the area i always stop in to al ' s . the pizza is excellent when fresh out of the oven and still pretty damned good when reheated for individual slices . the staff is always attentive , courteous , and friendly . i can ' t say much about the other items on the menu but al ' s certainly has a pizza that can fulfill any hunger . 
primo icecubes . very symmetrical , almost perfectly square . perfectly sized at N and N N inches . would recommend . 
usually good service . they need to create gluten free options . good , casual italian food . nothing spectacular and nothing bad . parking in strip mall so it can be challenging . 
protip if you order via seamless web you better order way before you even think about being hungry because delivery time is like N-N minutes . as delicious as crisp is , the portion size is huge and i can never finish the whole thing . i always tell myself i ' ll put it in the office fridge and eat it the next day but if youve ever seen the inside of an office fridge then you already know how that turned out . the office fridge is kinda like food purgatory--the place where leftovers go until they get old enough to finally be thrown out . . . . . but i digress , the point was that crisp is really good . order early and share with a friend ! 
still one of my favorite restaurants . the food is phenomenal and the service is friendly and unpretentious . i always order the bucatini ( perfection ) , but the other pastas are just as fantastic . also try the prosciutto or one of the in-house meats ( testa-yum ! ) and the pork shoulder . 
oh , zahav . what can i say about you that hasn ' t been said hundreds of times before ? . . . likely nothing . this entrance-statement has probably even been said before . i can yak about your wonderful restaurant week deal . i can tell everyone that i had one of the best meals of my entire life here . i can even reiterate the fact that when i got home last night , i didn ' t move an inch for a good hour . last night was like yelp-night at zahav , i tell you . there were several of us spread around the restaurant without actually planning it out that way . at our table , fellow yelper ashley s . and i were mind-blown by the amount of food given to us -- despite seeing the reviews ahead of time . this may have been the longest meal of my life , having clocked in at N . N hours . first there was the salatim and hummus and laffa bread . i loved the beets especially . then came the cauliflower , chicken that tasted like christmas , grape leaves , and haloumi . after that , i had the ribeye -- medium rare , as they suggested . chocolate mousse for dessert . oh , and also a desert rose ( gin ) cocktail . always the gin . servers were super professional and ready to swoop in with fresh plates and silverware ( and also boxes . . . ) when we were done each course . the manager was also very friendly . he asked me where i purchased my change purse since it was clearly turkish . when he said , " i hope to see you again , " i awkwardly replied , " you too , " instead of " thank you , " and i ' m not even ashamed , because i must go back . they even gave a N off return coupon . so really . i will return . who wants to go ? i ' m serious . 
didn ' t like food
my experience with sichuan food can be likened to certain designer drug . the first time you try it a number of questions run through your head how much is too much ? , is this going to kill me ? can i trust this asian guy to sell me the real deal ? but you really just end up sweating a lot , yearning for more , and drinking a ton of water . and you love it . that ' s the addiction . we also know with these types of things that your first time is your best . my first time was with han ' s . it was the best time . while this particular concoction was certainly nice too , producing the familiar effects of sweat , desire , love and regret but it ' s just not the same as that first time . so this is why spice gets N - N stars . side note N service here was absolutely phenomenal . we had drinks at the bar while waiting for our reservation and were very well taken care of from start to finish . this is a big differentiator here . they truly seem to appreciate your business . go give em some . side note N you can make comparable dan dan noodles at home . it ' s actually pretty easy . the key ingredient ? tahini . and good sichuan peppercorns . watch for cheap versions that have a lot of stems in the bag . oh god , was that another drug reference ? 
i came into connecticut from md to visit friends . they brought me out to this place to try their latin american breakfast and they did not disappoint . i tried their green plantains balls with cheese and pork and it was amazing . i felt like i was back in ecuador eating out of my grandma ' s kitchen . i paired the green plantain balls with a bistec a la criolla . later that day i had to return because i had to try their dinner dishes . i tried their ecuadorian shrimp ceviche and once again i was astonished . i was overwhelmed with awesomeness of this dish . the service was great as well . very attentive and friendly . great experience ! ! ! 
brought my friend here who has never tried filipino food . we both got breakfast platters . i had the tosilog which is like their form of bacon but its thicker and juicier kinda . which comes with fried garlic rice . and eggs any way you want it . my friend had the tapsilog which were beef slices and came with the rice and egg too . the portion was big . it was so good that when we were full . we lingered and just talked for about N mins , and then finished the rest of our plate which then led to the itis and going to bed right after ! 
my wife and i took my parents there for lunch and were greeted by stares from the staff with no greeting whatsoever despite there being only five people in the entire place . this was followed by a rude , abrupt waitress who acted like we had to speed talk to place an order . to cap off this wonderful experience , the pizza was non descript and the pasta tasted like it had been ordered from a diner . so poor , in fact , that my two kids , who normally love pasta , refused to eat theirs . won ' t be back and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone . 
move over , thai and make some room , vietnamese ! maharlika proves that filipino food is the next big trend in ethnic new york cuisine . this restaurant offers a surprising combination of classic filipino dishes designed with a young , modern palette in mind . some of the best filipino i ' ve had in quiet a while , i was particularly impressed by their brunch specials including a to-die-for spicy bloody mary , made only the way filipinos would with banana ketchup , fish sauce , and chillis ! much like everything with filipino cuisine , the ingredients are unexpected . . . but come together in a pleasing dance unlike any other cuisine you ' ve tried . brunch can get busy , so reservations are recommended . i highly recommend maharlika for both those uninitiated to the filpino cuisine as well as those who have grown up with " lola ' s " home cooking - ) 
def N . N stars . . . . very good home cooked italian food . excellent pasta specials ! 
 this is the place for all hot dog lovers out there . you will find out why in this review great hot dog " rippers " , which is called that due to the fact that the casings crack when the hot dogs are actually fried ! onion rings are addictive . about N of the place is fried food , if you ' re really hungry , then this is place for you . i will go back there sometime , worth the health-risk after having consumed the foods there despite it ' s quality . just good . affordable , fast-casual , like usual to most hot dog joints throughout nj . 
needs better cooks in the kitchen and they act like they are doing you a favor
if you come to this cart , then you meet a sweet lady who is helpful and ready to take your order . when i was introduced to it from a close friend , i immediately recognize street car favorites ngow zaap ( beef tripe ) , yiu don fun ( fish ball rice noodles ) , and lo mi gai ( chicken inside sticky rice leaf wrap ) . on your cherng fun ( rice crepe noodles ) , you can have gee mai ( sesame seeds ) , hoisin sauce , or laat chern ( spicy red hot sauce ) . after visiting once , i have already came back and even had a long conversation with her . rumor has it that she is done by N or N pm , so please arrive early . and you have to find seating in seward park or take it home . . . this is a food cart , not a restaurant or cafe . good news she speaks cantonese fluently and english clearly . i would definitely be back ! 
william s . and i went on monday during restaurant week and i ' m between a N and a N here . . . but i guess it says something that i ' m rounding up . we got to olde city a half-hour early and thought we ' d grab a quick drink at the bar before getting seated , but the crowd on monday after work is . . . the after work crowd . lots of men sitting alone at the bar in suits , and we kinda stuck out in our " young people " clothes , so we went a block away to eulogy . pros -the service was great . i ' m sure it had a lot to do w harrison , our server , who was fab , not bc he was particularly chatty or trying too hard but was very informative , friendly and let us enjoy our meal . glasses of water always over half-full , napkins folded after returning from the restroom , we didn ' t wait too long for our dishes . . . ya know . -the veggie dishes ! grilled asparagus with poached egg and mahon cream sauce . who knew asparagus could blow your mind ? ! i was sad we had to share it . also really enjoyed the grilled veggie appetizers that comes out w little toasted bread some cheesy spread ( great description , i know . . ) not-my-fave ( just has to do w what we ordered . . . ) -white wine sangria w the pear . my first time having white wine sangria and i ' m sure its just a preference thing , but definitely go for the red wine one over this . -short-rib flatbread . it was just ok . overall , i was pleasantly surprised and its in the running to be my fave jg joint . . . can ' t wait to go back ! ( hint-hint hubby ) 
holy cannoli . it ' s that good . they pipe it fresh into your fried crispy goodness of a shell , large or small . next time , getting a large one . oh yea , and sandwiches delish too . 
i ' ve been here twice and both times it was great . had to make reservations weeks in advance , but it ' s worth it ! definitely get the tasting menu . food is served family style , so if you coordinate with the rest of your party , you ' ll be able to try almost everything on the menu . i don ' t remember everything we picked , but it was all really delicious . everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned . there are a lot of " interesting " dishes on the menu like duck hearts , sweetbreads , and beef tongue . . . so i ' m not sure that i would take a super non-adventurous eater here ( like my dad , who once sent back a seared tuna steak at bookbinders because he thought it " wasn ' t cooked " ) . but if you can convince those people to try something new , they ' ll love it . the service was great attentive without hovering . my only criticism is that some of the tables are realllllly close together , but everything else is so good that it doesn ' t matter . a nice bonus when they called my fiance to confirm our reservation , they asked if there was any special occasion ( it was our anniversary ) . we received complemetary glasses of champagne , and an additional course of smoked sable ( edit oops , just remembered it was not arctic char as i originally wrote ) , which was of course delicious . 
sandwiches are delicious , as is the coffee . it ' s wonderful to have this much-needed addition to the neighborhood . i ' d say my biggest gripe is the baked goods i ' d like more variety and better selections . the muffins are sort of generic yogurt muffins you could get anywhere . if your coffee is stumptown and your sandwiches are artisanal , why not bake your own muffins or get them from some great place like blue sky bakery ? it doesn ' t make sense . and how bout some chocolate chip cookies ? okay , i ' d also like wifi ! but now i ' m done complaining ! welcome , brooklyn commune . i wish you much success . i don ' t think other reviewers are fair to complain about there being kids there . . . maybe they should spend more time in their neighborhood where there are many kids . and they just opened , so i give them a little more time to work out service kinks on busy days . 
one of my favorite places in fishtown . i especially love the food-the grilled cheeses are always delicious and the bread pudding i had is the best i have ever had anywhere , i kept fantasizing about it afterwards . they are always playing an eclectic mix of good tunes and the place has a relaxed vibe . they change the specialty drinks and took my favorite one off . . . it had gin in it and i never drink gin but it was so good i made an exception . every time i went the service has been super friendly and on top of things . it is one of my go to places in my neighborhood
great service , great food and authentic ! 
i know this is a pancake house , but i really love their omelette . 
we enjoyed our dinner ! we had the hanger steak , trout , and croque monsieur . fantastic ! plus some incredible oysters from mass . yummy wild mushrooms . finished with delightful dark chocolate pudding and banana walnut brownie and maple bourbon ice cream ! had manhattan ' s and martini while we waited for a table . wonderful experience ! 
it was quite interesting to see chef jump from his seat to the counter where the raw foods are right before us . it ' s quite entertaining to watch two chefs grilling in front of us if you ' re being seated in the front bar of the restaurant . the bar is elongated facing towards chef either directly or sideway , so you ' ll get a pretty good views whereever you ' re seated . i ' d have to say all the food , especially seafoods looks really fresh , i ' ve never seen gigantic shrimp or scallops in shells . we ordered a whole mackeral , veggies such as asparagus , mushroom , brussel sprouts that were grilled to perfection , we also order salmon cerviche , it was beyond delicious and refreshing w just right touch of citrus ! the sliced beef ( forgot the name of the dish ) appetizer was prepared really well , j was nice enough to yield me the last piece cos of odd number of pieces ) . their menu changes daily , that reassure the freshness of the food ! overall , i love the food , our waters were filled the whole time . like most of the yelpers mentioned , the portions can be small , for example , an order of broussel sprout came w N pieces , so it comes down to quality over quantity ! 
best ramen place we have found in manhattan thus far . granted , we haven ' t been to them all ( maybe in a year or so ) , but as my boyfriend put it , the chicken paitan ramen is like a hug from the inside . 
was the soba good ? sure . is it worth the N-N ? hell no . not to mention the N red bean dessert bun the size of a golf ball . the quality of food is definitely there , plus it comes out right after you order , but sorry i ' d rather buy my own udon soba and feed a family for the same price . the service wasn ' t the best , and they sure know how to be pushy and ask you to leave when there are other folks waiting . sorry sobaya , i had high hopes for you as i love soba , but you ' re not worth the wait . 
the first thing i have to say is the greek yogurt is amazing . personally , i do not like yogurt , at all , i just never got into it . so i was skeptical of trying it as a dessert , but i am so glad i did , it is just the best thing ever . but now that i am done with that their greek fries ? good enough to go on another rant about how great it is , but i will leave it at " you need to try it . " so the basic outline of our dinner went something like pita bread with N types of dippings , the spicy cheese ( which is not spicy ) is my favorite , but definitely try them all . we essentially had an endless supply of pita bread and there is enough of the N dippings to last the entire meal . then we had the greek fries ( yay ) then there were the actual stix , i tried the chicken one , which was grilled perfectly . finally there was dessert , which consisted of the greek yogurt with strawberries and blueberries , and some type of homemade donut with honey and the option of chocolate . i don ' t even think that is an accurate way to describe the latter , but either way it was great . so if all of this means nothing to you just remember this stix has the best greek yogurt and fries and you need to try them both . also , you cannot go wrong with the pita bread , i think we had about N servings , so yes , it is great . 
this place is away from the main drag in montclair . still on bloomfield and way easier to get parking . the service js friendly and quick . the food is great . recommend to do take out for a good dinner at home too . 
i live in nyc but was visiting a friend ' s family out in jerz for the weekend . we went out to a few different restaurants and caldwell ' s was by far the best quality in terms of food . i do not get out much for seafood in the city , so this was a great treat . service and ambiance was fine as well , but the food was the best part ! 
nyc meal with nj price ! definitely go for the tasting menu , which changes seasonally and you can ' t go wrong . the chef staff sommelier gets a N star wine selection N thus for the N star review . 
simply the temple of taquerias ! 
we are staying about N doors down from here and have walked by it on and off , so not wanting to go far we stopped in for dinner and were lucky to get a booth . it ' s a warm and inviting restaurant but it does get loud when busy , so if you want an intimate meal , go elsewhere . our server was friendly and took good care of us . i did check yelp first and went to their website and wanted to try the mac ' n cheese with chicharron . creamy cheese and crispy pork . . . and a spicy kick ! very good ! we ordered a reasonably priced malbec and i ordered their version of eggs benedict and the partner ordered the arroz con pollo . my hollandaise also had a little spicy kick to it as did the home crispy potatoes . the arroz came out in a large bowl and tossed with the moist chicken . of course we had to have dessert and i decided to be good and ordered the carrot cake . this was not overly sweet which was great ! a very satisfying evening . there ' s more on the menu and i believe we might come by again one more time . another plus is that they are open N N . maybe i ' ll go for an early morning breakfast . . . . hhhmmm . 
great menu , they have more better options than the typical chinese take-out joint . dishes i can recommend -tofu in black bean sauce -chicken in spicy tea sauce -crab rangoon - you can get this anywhere , but jin ' s is better than average
baristas with crazy top-notch skills and a side of surly . good vibe , and i ' d be happy to chill there in the evenings . ohhhh but wait ! Npm close . c ' mon , upper valley . take a chance on at least Npm . panera does . don ' t make me go there anymore . food is pricier than i ' m comfortable with . an otherwise stellar grilled cheese and tomato hurt the wallet at N . N . maybe it is a marriage of artisan cheese lovingly crafted from milk abundantly flowing from the owner ' s organically grain-fed free range star cow , and an heirloom tomato birthed from the lineage of a N year old seed . could be . i ' ll ask . cos i will be there again . 
teeny tiny place ( and teeny tiny bathroom , but clean ) with lovely ambience , but super loud . my husband and i had trouble hearing each other across the table . i can ' t imagine what a larger group would experience . that said , we had a lovely meal . great service from the waitress and the owner ( a woman -- which always makes me happy ) . the bread basket comes with oil vinegar , which was surprising to me since i think of butter when i think of french restaurants . i had the goat cheese tarte appetizer ( served with a small salad on the plate ) . it was quite large with a nice crust and a lot of goat cheese . my husband had the pear and blue cheese appetizer ( also served with a small salad on the plate ) . his was super delicious ! for my main course i had the small portion of the moules mariniere . i ' m glad i had the small , as it was quite a large portion . i can ' t imagine what the large must be like . i was very very disappointed to discover that virtually all the mussels still had their beards . this is a dish i have had often elsewhere and i can ' t remember that every being the case . that said , the broth was lovely . my husband had the cassoulet and enjoyed it very much . it ' s quite a heavy dish for summer , but he was very happy with it . for dessert we shared the cheese plate three cheeses ( a soft brie , a semi soft stinky cheese , and a hard waxy cheese ) served with soft bread , three slices of apple , and a teaspoon or two of jam . i did not care for the hard cheese ( not enough flavor for me ) , but the other two were fine . a very nice experience overall . i would go back . i strongly recommend making a reservation . fyi it ' s byob and cash only . 
really excellent chinese food-- they have an extensive menu , items are reasonably priced , and they even offer alcoholic beverages , unlike most chinese restaurants . i have loved everything i have ordered , except for the sweet and sour chicken , which contained small pieces of fried chicken that were just too greasy . the service is great for dining and take out . 
i bring out of towners to coppelia every chance i get . i even dragged along my family for brunch on christmas eve and they made room for all N of us . my favorite dinner order is an avocado milkshake ( fantastic ! ) and the cuban sandwich . the cocktails are also fabulous , particularly the spicy michelada and the mojitos . for non-pork folks , the veggie burger , salads and beef empanadas are also excellent . 
we have been to sampan several times since they opened . we have always had a great meal with great friendly service . our favorite dishes are the tuna tacos , dumplings , lamb satay , brussel sprouts , and bahn mi sandwich . the small cones for dessert are always a hit and we look forward to see the flavors of the night . lately , we have been going there to sit outside , either in the front ( they have about N-N tables ) or we love the graffiti bar in the back of the restaurant . how many restaurants can you really go to and sit outside and eat without being on the sidewalk ? it is a really funky bar and eating area with a great vibe ! we sometimes have to wait on weekends to be seated for a few minutes , however i do not mind because the drinks are good and the manager and hostesses are all friendly . it is our new favorite restaurant in philly and we will keep going back to see chef schulson ' s new menu additions . 
the best empanadas and ice pops i ever had in nyc and the prices are cheap . 
what can i say ? everyone from the bartenders , to servers , to the chefs are some of the nicest staff i ' ve encountered in a restaurant in a long time ! i ' ve been here a few times now and have loved every minute of all my visits . the tuna pizza at the bar is amazing ! and N for the bread and butter is worth it ! hand down the best butter i have ever had ! the truffles they add to it are mouthwatering , and the bread is just as good ! the cocktails are as fabulous as the truffle better and i still think about the white peach sorbet i had over a month ago . hand down one of the best i ever had ! i can say i prefer prospect to a lot of N star restaurants i have been to in manhattan recently , and this is cheaper ! 
my go-to brunch spot in my neck of the hood . nashville style fried chicken is free range , spicy , and delicious . scrambles are solid and the sandwiches are generous . cocktails are a little too sweet for my taste , but anything to fight the hangover right ? 
this pizza joint is a keeper . everytime my hubby and i go here , the line is out the door , and the manager gets everyone seated by N minutes ! the salads are light and fresh . pizza is not greasy . we are fans ! ! ! 
i ' ve been here twice and have loved it each time . the tapas are great portions and are of high quality . drinks are great , the interior is beautiful , the servers are quick and friendly and dessert is amazing as well . i would come more often if it was cheaper - that is the only downfall . 
not sure what i ' m missing here , but this was definitely our most disappointing dinner while out in ny . what am i missing here ? ? ? after hearing so much hype about this burger , i booked us a reservation three days later from when i called . i assumed that this could only mean that this burger will help you realize the meaning of life . we went ahead and shared the black label burger , and the mesclun salad . the salad was literally nothing more than greens and goat cheese . as for the burger , it was just bread and meat , which furthermore , increased my expectations for this thing . sadly enough , my expectations were not even the least bit close to being met . now by no means was the burger disgusting or " bad , " but wasn ' t much more impressive than . . . an in n ' out burger ? the rest of the table also was just as disappointed as well . charging N for this burger makes baby jesus cry . . . and made me upset . i will mention that their fries were damn tasty . too bad i didn ' t think about stuffing a whole bunch of them in the burger to enhance its flavor . . . . unless you ' re that pretentious douche bag that has to dine at such hyped-up , " renowned " spots just for bragging rights , skip this place and just hit shake shack . 
my first experience with mamoun can be described as a scene from fear loathing . my vague memory of that faithful night was that , " this is the bomb ! ! ! ! " since that night i ' ve often wondered if said shawarma was as delicious as my intoxicated self perceived it . one year later , i find myself here in west village on a lovely friday afternoon . scared that i ' ll disappoint myself , i went in with a full heart and empty stomach . food boooommm ! ! ! ! thats how i ' ll describe it . meat was flavorful with awesome burnt ends , which added to the texture . brillant idea to keep the tomatoes cubed and fairly large . crisp lettuce evenly dispersed . this my friend is a great shawarma . though the meat was a bit gamey at times , the sauce helped cover it up . definitely one of the better ones i ' ve had , but still not beating my all time favorite , ali baba ' s in valley stream long island . even better than their food , is their service . fast and on point ! i literally ordered and by the time i could reach for my wallet , the food was done . pretty sure they had a lot of training for the busy night hours when drunk people storm their store . enjoy ! 
an amazing experience each time . came in after work for a quick snack and ended up staying for hours . best tacos ever . the menu items are creative and delicious , thanks to the genius head chef who is always there . i wholeheartedly recommend this place for a special date or a night out with the whole family . enjoy ! 
this was my favorite weekend am place when i lived in old city ! the coffee and iced tea are better than anywhere else around and their sandwiches are creative , fresh , and delicious . even when i didn ' t go in , i always loved seeing the people sitting outside , looking so chic and enjoying a mid-day snack . and they take credit cards ! woohoo ! 
i love the cantina for the chips and salsa and drink menu . the service has really improved over the past couple of years and the new outdoor seating area is great if not a little dark at night time . i will say that the food is pricey for what you get , and the vegan appetizer with the amaranth should be avoided . yuck . 
the food is phenomenal . i recommend any of the ceviches they offer . very good quality seafood and the service is very quick no matter how busy it is . the drink menu is also really good , i recommend a pitcher of sangria to share . definitely a place to go with a big group or friends as it gets busy it is loud and the music is playing at all times . not really a romantic date night type of restaurant . 
my favorite food is a cheese steak i ' ve had sooooo many over the years that i was scared to have the " orginal . " being from nyc the drive was about N hours . i get there and the line is around the . . . the triangle ? i have no idea what you call the space pat ' s is situated on . but yeah the line was long . there were N of us and we approach the window to order and see an ordering guide of sorts . has like N rules . N . know what you want . N . " wit " or wit w cheese . N . what cheese , wiz , provolone . . . ect . N . practice this in line before you ' re up to order and work out borrowing money before you get up to order . so my friends order first and they guy is rushing them like a tsunami was on its way and he had to close the damn shop up , but out of the kindness of his heart before the wave hit he was going to take his order . i was traumatized ! when my turn came up i didn ' t even bother ordering . when he asked what i wanted i said " nothing . i ' m with them . " and meekly moved out of the line . we take a seat and my friends give me some of their cheese steak and to be honest it was just aaight ! the steak was too thick and could have used some more seasoning . oh and talk about over priced . at N dollars a piece i expected a lot more . i ' ll tick to charlie ' s for my cheese steak fix . so my friends ask me if i wanna go across the street to geno ' s and buy one from them and i say " hell no ! " we get in the car and drive to front street or something and we go to have drinks at copa banana and i order a burger " well done . " the burger was effing rare ! ! ! but that ' s another review . 
the person took reservation was a little rude on the phone . the service was okay when we got there . the food is average . maybe i have too high of expectation for the place . 
stopped by when in town because i heard decent reviews . food wasn ' t bad but customer service was ! and woman who prepared food did so with bare hands . . . no gloves . had a bad attitude from the get go . won ' t go back . 
i have been twice . the first was on a summer saturday . the wait was N minutes , no big deal . the pizza was awesome . thin and crisp . everything was perfect . service was attentive but not over bearing . we sat downstairs which is ok , i would have preferred to be on the main level . my second experience was on a tuesday at N . the waiter told us the oven does not hit it ' s prime temperature till at least N and unfortunately we could taste the difference . 
had the cuban . no lie one of the best cubans i ' ve ever had ! the staff was super friendly i will def be returning ! once again try the cuban ! 
food is ok , nothing special . prices are high for the quality of food you get . i do not mind spending money on a good meal however , i do mind spending alot of money on a mediocre meal . wait staff was friendly . i would not recommend this place , there are better mexican restaurants out there . 
awesome pizza . not sure if its worth the hype . 
way overpriced for the food served . was there on saturday night N N . you can go to any falafel joint and get everything on the menu for N of the cost . the service was not good . took way to long to get our food and then when the food came out they didn ' t know what dish went where and we were missing items as well . then there is the bar . what a lame excuse for a bar tending staff . really ! ! i come up to a bar to get served not to watch the bartender and bar staff socialize making me wait N minutes for a drink and that was with a half filled bar . just do you job . your a bartender , bartend ! ! 
public is kind of an anomaly in that it ' s a rather nice place to eat , except you ' re just as likely to be sitting next to someone who is dressed like they were a guest on a montel show as they are to be wearing shirt and tie . anyhow , the girl and i have eaten here a few times , and each time it ' s actually the drink that pulls us back in . they had a drink called a liquid gold , and i would tell you what ' s in it except it ' s not on the menu anymore . bastards . drinks are normal N each prices , and come swiftly and with a punch . entrees run from N to N each , with sides running about N and appetizers that tend to hover around the N mark . i have to say that i really dig that they do different things with their menu , and have some really unique takes on dishes . she got the oxtail ravioli recently , but i don ' t even remember what i had . what i remember is that we were both in the mood for pho . like hardcore . we contemplated cancelling the reservations just to walk down mott and eat at pho bang , but decided to follow through on the dinner plans . so her ravioli comes out and , what the holy jesus hell , it tastes like pho . but concentrated . what the eff is that about ? i mean that in a good way . she hasn ' t stopped talking about it since , and being that their menu changes frequently i don ' t know that we would experience that again . tangent about ravioli that tastes like vietnamese street food aside , very above average food , and with sensible ordering and drinking you can walk out of there for about N per person , which i think is very reasonable given the quality . side note they sucked the first time we went . we ' ve been back a number of times since and it seems to be that we had an off experience the first time , so the rating does not reflect that . 
my brother and i had the pleasure of attending multiple events at the forsgate country club . one event to mention was the nj small business development center ' s annual success award luncheon . this was our first time at forsgate and we were very impressed by the main entrance and facility . we were able to explore other aspects of the venue such as their meeting area and restaurant during the forsgate foundation annual golf outing . at that time , we were also able to take a tour of their beautiful golf course . our most recent event that we attended was the freehold nj network for success event . once again , we were greeted with a warm welcome and inviting atmosphere . we also had the pleasure of meeting the executive chef . after speaking with him , we knew that he took pride in his work and was meticulous about the presentation of his food . overall forsgate country club is a great destination for your future events . mentioned events njsbdc . com blog category forsgatefoundation . org facebook . com groups free 
i love this place . if you can ' t find it at the terminal market you can ' t find it ! food is delicious and varied . candy shop is the best , kitchen store has a bunch of " what did i ever do w out this " . great for out of guest of the city and locals . 
got a same day reservation at walter ' s for N N pm for dinner - late but what can you do when you don ' t plan in advance ? we arrived at N N and were promptly seated even though the place was packed . the atmosphere is very comfortable , a little loud but not over the top , with excellent , fast service . i had the french dip ( filet mignon on a soft baguette with au jus on the side ) but ordered garlic mashed potatoes instead of the fries . sandwich was awesome , mashed was good but a little cold . my friends got the grilled bar steak ( strip steak ) spicy fisherman ' s stew ( really spicy ) for entrees and for appetizers ordered the octopus , artichoke dip and crab . i didn ' t try the crab or octopus but the dip was delicious . they all raved about everything they tried so walter ' s is a definite new dinner spot for us . 
great place for italian food ! i love the marsala sauce and pasta here . the chicken parmesan was so-so only , otherwise i would give this place a five ! it ' s a family style restaurant , so you can order a few dishes and share . the dishes are huge ! we always order the calamari here also . the desserts are excellent ! ( to be shared as well ) 
great fries , good burgers . if you are looking for a good burger and beer kinda place in new haven , this is a good bet . its a bit cheaper and easier to get into than prime N . the service is a bit hit or miss , but its never been horrible . i go to rudy ' s all the time . 
i ' m from new york so i ' m especially picky about my pizza . i ' ve tried many pizza joints around new haven and oregano joe ' s is by far the closest thing to what i ' m used to . i ordered a large thin crust cheese pizza and it tasted- delicious ! reminded me of new york style pizza , that ' s how good it was . this is my new go to pizza place- even if i have to drive all the way from west haven ! 
best pizza around ! friday and saturday they are open till Nam thats crazy ! ! ! love the service and food . staff is very friendly . 
even better than pat ' s or geno ' s ! and much more conveniently located to the sites . don ' t miss this gem for an amazing philly chessesteak . 
you haven ' t lived until you walk into this charming eatery and order a " popover breakfast " which will have you dreaming of another one for days to come ! it consists of a huge , melt-in-your-mouth popover filled with scrambled eggs , cheese , broccoli and spinach , heavenly homefries and fresh fruit on the side . . . . . scruptious ! 
always good and open N hours . big menu with all the standards , and you get everything the way you asked for it . these guys know how to run diners . 
great products . i always get the sheep ' s milk goat cheese . so good - like no other cheese i have tasted . the red-headed counter girl is always so helpful and friendly ( give her a promotion and a raise ! ) . shopping there is so nice and relaxing . i wish more places could be like this . 
this is definitely the best restaurant in greenpoint . the only problem with this place you have to wait to get seated -always . this is why we went there after N pm , and anyway N minute wait . we tried the homemade ricotta and the scallops , both were awesome . after that we ordered ravioli and shepherd ' s pie delicious . i wish i could try the brunch sometime , but when i see the line of people every sunday it is unbelievable . good job
their reubens are phenomenal . . by far my favorite ( along with koch ' s deli ) . there ' s enough meat on the sandwich that you can make it into N meals . the price is a little expensive for a sandwich , but it ' s worth it with the amount of food you get . if you ' re in there before N , their challah bread french toast is also really really good . great staff too
great food , decent prices , and cheerful attitude from the employees . this is my to-go place when i crave for some chinese food . also , they have a reward board on their wall . with pictures of past caterings and all these achievements . to let the owner know if he reads this-you should update the achievements , they are outdated . . . ( N ) . and i liked you guys on facebook . finally you started a page ! you only got like N likes so any bao lovers out there give them a good job for the work they do , because for the delicious food they make , they deserve more ! 
i met my N girlfriends there one sunday afternoon . no one came over and even offered a beverage for at least N minutes . when i looked at any of the waitresses they all turned their heads as if they didn ' t already catch me eye ! finally , we ordered . upon delivery of our meals , everyone ' s , your read that right , everyone ' s order was wrong , except mine . i was the only salad . they took all the plates back but when they came back again , still wrooonggg ! finally on the third try they got it right . in fairness the food was good but the service was crap ! ! they could not even get the change right when we paid the bill . i asked for singles but got large bills . when i said something , the women , apparently the owner was so snippy , i wanted the tip back . when everyone left and i was last out the door , all miss snippy could say was i ' m sorry , so glad you told me . but she knew something had been going wrong all along . as courtesy , they should have at least made some kind of offer . . . but no . . . too bad . this was my first time and if it ' s managed this poorly , i doubt i would go again nor would i recommend . 
first and foremost , it ' s important to understand the concept behind momofuku ss m bar ( pronounced ' siam ' ) . prior reviewers have commented that the food is asian fusion , but it is in fact american new cuisine . the idea behind the range of influences ( many admittedly are asian ) is that american food draws influences from the immigrants that come here , so of course variations on korean and chinese food are as american as they are korean or chinese . and the philosophy shows through in the way traditional american dishes are infused with eastern influences . for instance , the beef brisket i had was served as small slices of beef in a broth and eaten with chopsticks and while the horseradish was decidedly american , the spices definitely were not . this is a common theme throughout the menu here a traditional american dish will be given a new spin through the eyes of immigrants . true , some dishes are true to their roots the pork buns , which are quite possibly the best use of pork ever devised , are essentially asian . but the rotating menu is not beholden to one culture or one way of thinking about presenting and eating food . except that it ' s all delicious . i recommend going with a small group of friends , maybe up to four , and ordering a bunch of small dishes to share . reasonably priced , a well-shared smattering will give you both an appreciation of the food itself and a full belly . the environment is certainly hip and the loud , well-selected rock music makes it hard to think of ss m bar as an intimate dining experience . no , this is a good laugh with friends over excellent , mouth-watering food . 
the brothers who used to run own this place are gone , and with them the charm . the food was never all that good , but the wines were carefully selected , the music interesting and eclectic , the crowd diverse . now it ' s way too loud , overcrowded , the wine selection gone downhill ( a glass i had there recently was terrible and never would have made it anywhere near the list before ) , the tunes more like what you would hear at a sports arena . . . it ' s ok , but what used to be a comfy neighborhood winebar where the owners just wanted to talk about wine now feels like a business catering to people flying in from the uws . they ' re doing very well , and good for them , but the soul is gone . 
the banh mi here is quite delicious . with a small vietnamese population , it is hard to find quality banh mi here in the city , but saigon banh mi delivers on taste and friendly service . i ' ve tried their N ( saigon pork ) and N ( meatball ) . the N is the most popular choice , savory meats balanced with crisp cucumbers , pickled daikon and carrots , cilantro , and jalapeno peppers ( optional ) . the N banh mi xiu mai ( meatball ) contains juicy crushed pork meatballs and the usual dressing of cucumbers , pickled daikon carrots , and jalapeo peppers . it ' s quite good , but the bread can get a bit on the soggy side from its juiciness . when introducing friends to banh mi , i usually take them here . they ' re all hooked on banh mi now . 
the brunch is amazing ! fried chicken biscuit - get that shit ! ! ! also duck rolls were amazing too . . . i ' m really shocked how good they were at an american bar . they ' ve put some kind of american twist to it but i like it . bonus - the bartender looks and sounds like chelsea handler . 
had another great meal last night . home made pasta to die for . great staff , great surroundings . my nine-year-old loves it too . 
the surrounding neighborhood is so-so but the food was delicious . the kitchen is right in front of your eyes ! the dishes are small , meant to be shared , tapas style but if you order around the recommended N-N , it is sufficient . i liked the softshell crabs , tartar dishes and so forth . there is an outdoor seating area . it ' s not too big but it is a great place to try out if you are in the area . the dishes are slightly pricey . you are also given some chef ' s special prior to your meal - sometimes a small sampling of a soup . it is complimentary . overall , the experience is what counts ( at least to me ) . as soon as we sat , the place started to fill up on a sunday Npm time slot , wow ! 
ichabod ' s , located in gramercy , just opened in the spring and has become one of our favorites and a must every time we visit the city ! having dined there now at least a dozen times , i am particularly impressed with the consistent quality . . . whether we order an appetizer , an entree from the menu , or the nightly special . my favorite is definitely the tuna tartare , which i order every time i visit . my husband loves the burger and the chicken . the squash dumplings were a huge surprise and something we highly recommend . really , everything we have tried so far ( and we ' ve tried nearly everything on the menu ) has been delicious . oh . . . and the ice cream sundae with the toasted marshmallows . . . i know i shouldn ' t but i always have to finish my meal with that ! it is just too good . plus , my husband shares it with me . 
green shakshuka green shakshuka green shakshuka must have ! ! ! ! my husband and i are addicted to the green shakshuka here . . . . . . if you come here for brunch , lunch , breakfast , whatever you gotta try it ! love the flavor , its light yet so flavorful at the same time . also try the mint tea . . . . on a cold nyc day it is the best thing to have . we have had their chicken kebab and the chicken prego and both are good , but what keeps us coming back is that green shakshuka . for those who don ' t know shakshuka is usually red because its made with tomatoes but here its green and yummylicious ! if you ' re coming here on the weekend be ready for a wait because the wait is crazy long . . . . sometimes up to N hours yikes ! ambiance is cute and the place is tiny and crowded but then again it is nyc . the service is always good and the waiters are always the sweetest . if you ' re looking for a breakfast brunch lunch place in the city come try this place out and remember get the green shakshuka ! 
such a great authentic chinese restaurant ! ! ! i ' m really loving this place . definitely need to come back with friends ! ! ! ! 
soooooooo yummy ! this might be the best mexican food i ' ve had in years ! i ended up ordering the " quesadilla " instead of a taco because the taco did not come with cheese , but the " quesadilla " was really just a taco with melted cheese so i ended up with just what i craved ! i got the chicken and the seasoning on the meat was perfect ! the cheese added a lot of flavor and the corn tortilla was nice and moist and soft . yum yum yum ! you ' ll probably need more than one to make a meal , but since i was only looking for a snack - one was perfect ! 
for a yelp foodie , i haven ' t really had an appetite lately . finally , on this day , i was starving ! my boss got a classic and a couple of other coworkers got some things . i , myself , had a really freakin good fried chicken sandwich from here fried chicken , pepper jack , red cabbage slaw melt sauce on sourdough we all got our food except the person who ordered the big skinny mozzarella , grilled mushrooms , roasted tomatoes , red peppers , arugula sherry vinaigrette on sourdough toast . we were like , " good job ordering those veggies . . . " no , not really , we were nice , but i got mine way before her . i don ' t know what was taking so long . thank god it was a decently warm day , since you ' re standing outside by the pick-up window . my boss was thinking that his sandwich was going to be all soggy by the time he ate it . it probably was , but it is a melt anyway . we all got tater tots too . my friend and i coulda shared them . my sandwich was pretty big so i was able to take home half with some spare tots . i ate it all for dinner , pre-santacon . i think it helped me survive the next day . i drank for N hours . . . . 
i am in love with this place . they are amazingly cheap and sooo good . i moved to new haven from dc a few months ago and was nervous about how good it would be because the storefront isn ' t amazing . but the service is great and the food is even better . two things to know - their chicken is way better than their beef - you don ' t quiet know when it will be open because they have minimal staff . sometimes it will randomly be closed or open N minutes late . it ' s such good food for so cheap , i have no idea how it stays open because it ' s that cheap ! 
nothing compares to freshly made hand pulled noodle soup on a cold nyc day ! when you pass by this restaurant , you might not want to go in because it ' s small and looks dingy . but trust me , the rave reviews are true ! i had the beef brisket noodle soup and boiled dumplings and it truly satisfied my cravings ! and , it was cheap ! the noodle soup was only N . N and the dumplings were N . N for N pcs ! i even bought their frozen dumplings to take home ( N . N N pcs ! ) . this is one of the best hole in the wall cheap eats places i ' ve been to ! 
this is an awful place to take your family to , unless you fancy impolite and rude staff , awful service and hospitality and lastly ruining your entire day . this place deserves no stars . i went to this terrible place on a sunday along with my parents who were visiting me . i could understand the rush on a sunday , so i was ok with the wait . but when people are waiting to be seated , i would expect the hotel staff to try and clean up tables as fast as possible . rite from step N the lacklustre attitude of the staff was so evident . finally , i took it upon myself to find a table and pointing out to one of their headless staffs that a table was free , and asked him to get it cleaned for us to be seated . i finally got a seat after N min . little did i know that it was going to get worser . though we got a seat , i didnt see any one even making an attempt to furnish the table with any of the cutlery , not even keeping any glasses or napkins . after about N min , we lost patience and i took it upon myself to engage another headless waiter to take our order . he said he will be back shortly . he came back after N mins and took our order . he hurriedly wrote down our order and disappeared . occasionally i used to see him wander across like a headless chicken . after half an hour , i got hold of this headless chicken and inquired about my order . he said he will check and get back . after another N min , he came back and told us casually that he had misplaced our order and without any guilt or shame , asked us to repeat our order so that he could write it down again . i just lost my patience and yelled at that guy . even my highly patient father , who usually is very calm and composed , couldnt resist this and ended up cursing that guy . we pretty much created a scene at the restaurant . the moron waiter even tried to talk back to us like its our fault . the management staff ( not sure if they have one ) didnt even try to resolve or throw in some apologies . they were just smiling . what a big waste of time . well i do agree with that moron waiter , as it was indeed our fault to have chosen this crappy place to dine . hospitality and service is the number N priority for a restaurant to excel , not just the food . i wouldn ' t be surprised if this place is either taken over or even shut down . 
today i made the trip for that pastrami sandwich that is so famous . and boy i wasn ' t let down . i ordered the large way way to big for me never again . i ' m so stuffed four hours later ! ! ! ! it was a great sandwich i enjoyed it along with a cream soda and that hit the spot . but traveling from queens it was a trip . they need to get a place in queens . 
yum . today was my first time there , but i will definitely be back . the staff was super friendly and attentive , and the brunch was crazy good . i had the poached egg , ham , potatoes , biscuit with almond butter , grits , blueberry pancake , and a mimosa . and if i had had room to eat every bite , i would have ! 
wow ! their burger was amazing . candied foie gras on a fresh , delicious burger . heaven . also , their staff is amazing and it ' s a nice atmosphere depite the crappy location . 
i always go to the bar and never had a bad meal . good place for a nice dinner too if you are entertaining guests or with family . they often have big parties so there often is a festive atmosphere . the specials are great and the menu consistent . what else can i say ! 
my experience was the food was great and the service leave you ecstatic . i believe every time you eat there you ' ll feel full what the first few bites i would recommend this to my family and friends and come on special occasions to this exquisite diner . and i recommend any birthdays to let staff know what the person likes as a cake because they will come out singing happy birthday and leaving you feeling embarrassed but happy . 
instead of medium well i received well done , over cooked meat . also the size of a N dollar burger is a joke . fries were gummy and soaked with oil . although i did like the overall vibe i ' m not intending on going back nor recommending this place to anyone . 
supper we found for a birthday dinner after reading amazing reviews . . . . . we couldn ' t have been happier with our experience there ! ! ! were seated at the bar----because of the crowd , but this is not a bad thing , we had the opportunity to watch the very talented chefs in action prepare our meals right in front of our eyes ! the grilled asparagus appetizer was perfection , while the lemon spaghetti so simple yet so tasty . the special pork chop that night was mouthwatering goodness , we had to go back again for our second birthday dinner . this time it was on a monday night , and we ordered the special-----which we will go back for every monday night from now on , was so succulent and right on . thank you to supper for having this authentic italian haven that is affordable with great service and even better food ! ! ! buonissimo ! ! 
chicken for two is by far the best chicken i have ever had . truly amazing . 
went here on N N N with , N people total . greeted warmly by the owner , valther , i called him al pacino , because of how much he resembles al . he was also our waiter . very attentive . this is a byob . we had a bottle of vodka but no olives . valther took care of that . he actually went out and bought us a bottle of green olives . food was awesome ! ! ! ! we did family style apps . dishes came full and left clean . we ate every morsel . dinner was perfect . i had the peppercorn filet , grilled to perfection . everyone else raved about there choices . the lasagna was described to us as the best lasagna ever . he wasn ' t kidding . make sure you try it . desserts were just as good . i had the lemoncilo . i also tried a couple of the others , mouth watering . will be back asap ! 
this place does not need another great review but you need to know that it is definitely a place you should check out . the dinner menu looked amazing and we were excited , but we went with friends and just got caught up in their amazing , i ' m saying it again , amazing appetizers . we started with the brussel sprouts ( and if you are one of those people who ' s childhood ruined these delicious veggies for give it another chance , i promise you won ' t be disappointed ) , grilled pita with three dips roasted beet skordalia , hummus and romesco , ( we had to keep asking for pita bread ) , lamb kefteddes , and the patatas bravas . we were loving the tapas theme we had started so we ordered more patatas bravas , mushrooms , and some items off of the daily menu ( which i can ' t remember right now , but trust me it was delicious . if you need another reason to check this place out we ordered tons of drinks and food for N hungry people and it came out to less then N . so check it out . buen provecho ! 
excellent food all around . the burgers are very hearty as well as the cheese steaks . food is often ready in under N minutes highly recommend if you ' re in the area . 
if this place was called something innocuous , like joe ' s deli , i might be able to give this place a higher rating . instead , they call it " gourmet heaven " , and give every appearance at first of being a high-end ye olde foode shoppe . when you actually try the food , it ' s both too expensive , and below par . hard to accomplish , but they manage it . even packaged things like sushi can look okay , but when you taste it you ' ll regret paying a N premium . entire sections of the store have no price tags . unless you have the conviction to walk out when you find out the price , don ' t even bother going in there . 
what a great lunch spot on a chilly , winter day ! the place is huge so there was no waiting for a table . there ' s a large selection of udon and or rice bowls . the food was made and served very quickly . i ' ve been eating a lot of ramen and pasta lately so i wasn ' t in the mood for more noodle . instead , i tried the beef bowl today and loved it . the proportion was huge so i had leftovers for dinner . 
review for happy hour only . went for a corporate event -- open bar sponsored event is a wonderful thing . they booked the lower level for the private event . great service , the servers come by often to get our orders so we dont have to wait at the bar and can maximize our mingle time . also love the fried mac and cheese balls - perfect finger food ! ! ! i ' ll definitely comr back for another happy hour . 
i ' m really surprised at the high reviews . . . i found their chicken to be very , very greasy . . . lacked crunch and flavor , mashed potatoes were super salty . . . i was pretty unimpressed overall and won ' t be giving it a second try . 
still not quite up to par with the east village one , but its pretty good still . tastes like the pots need to be broken in still , but its got potential . wait time is no where near as crazy as the the ev one , so its still worth a trip to come down if you ' re not into waiting N hours for a table . also has a unique separate seating area that you walk through a hidden door in the wall and up a flight of stairs that only has room for about N-N people and has its own ramen station that looks like is for private parties . 
we went off a recommendation as was very satisfied with the surf and turf . our bar bill put us over N mark but we had a good time and liked the atmosphere . the mall inside is actually very nice as well , we would like to come back . 
just close . now , please . after a bad meal , i guess it ' s pretty normal to feel angry or disappointed , but after my recent experience at buddakan , all i felt was sad . sad that this once great restaurant which hosted so many terrific memories for me in years past could devolve into what it ' s become today . N-N years ago this was a five star restaurant today it ' s not even passable . the appetizers were small and unimpressive . the angry lobster ( N ) was majorly overcooked ( used to be one of my favorites ) . the service was just poor all around . it wasn ' t just us - we heard comments from fellow diners about how bad the experience was . so i ' m puzzled who ' s writing all these glowing reviews , and which restaurant they actually visited . one interesting observation , we counted six ( N ) different birthday presentations while we were there ! i ' m not really sure what that means , but the fact that people still look at this as a special occasion restaurant is baffling . if you ' re looking to impress your significant other , this is not the place . this place is definitely resting on its laurels . save your money . 
this pizza is not cheap but i think it just might be the best that i have had in nj . i am not sure what the best way to describe the food . the thin pizza just cannot be missed . 
went here for my first birthday in nyc . i was alone , it was the summer , my friends were vacationing . i went to yelp , you saved my evening . i called and they told me to come drop by whenever that night . it ' s business casual btw . i walked in and was greeted by extraordinary staff , who were very courteous , helpful , and cheery . i ordered the grilled cobia ( they ran out of swordfish i think ) . it was fantastic . for dessert , i had mango sorbet and frozen greek yogurt . the sorbet was far too rich , didn ' t like it . but the greek was a very interesting experience , texture wise and taste wise . don ' t order the french fries , i did so for kicks . they are far too salty , and tasteless , i was expecting a bit more than mcdonald ' s . N stars otherwise . a fantastic meal , ran me about N ( i splurged- could have been under N easily ) . 
this place really isn ' t that great . . . i got the veggie burger , my girlfriend got the truffle burger , and we shared a truffle fry . the food was okay . . . i ' d take a five guys burger over it any day though . . . main complaint terrible , terrible organization . . waiting for a table we were told N minutes . . . fine . . . got texted that our table was ready . . got there then . . we were told another half hour . . . . okay . . . . then got told out table was almost ready ( as we saw atleast N open tables ) stood there another N minutes as a roach crawled along the floor . . . then they were about to seat a table of four and i stepped in and said eh you fucking idiots we ' ve been here forever and ur seating a table of four before us . . . got a table . . . then spent too much money for a small adequate meal . . . . last time i go to one of these fad places ! 
the N . N happy hour N Npm-Npm everyday includes beer , sake , wine , rolls , and appetizers . this is a great deal if you ' re looking for a cheap sushi dinner option , granted your office will let you out before N N pm . this place is also byob and there ' s no corkage fee for the first bottle you bring . the restaurant is cozy and intimate and the service is really nice . i ' ll definitely be back to satiate my sushi cravings without breaking the bank ! 
yuck ! ! i waited in line along with a troop of unbathed hipsters only to have the greasiest pizza coming out of the b rated health hazard . . . . N stars for simply being a pizza spot . 
a little bit of a drive if you ' re from outside of philly , but it is definitely worth the distance if you can cab or find a parking spot . the atmosphere was great for a reunion and birthday celebration . if things get slow , there ' s always jenga , amazing food and drinks ! will definitely come again with great company . 
i would suggest to the proprietor of juventino that he either relocate the establishment to manhattan or open after N N am on weekends to make it clear he is not interested in having families with young children at the restaurant . no matter how many times the word ' heirloom ' appears on the menu , being rude to parents of young children is not a sustainable business practice . 
went last night at Nam short and sweet food was ok . . wings is key punch drink was good burger sucked ! service . . well let ' s say dear manager your staff smokes weed at work and they have a little adjustment seating host was great super accomadating and at tentative to our searing request . 
my husband and i have been going here for about N years . the food is good--burgers of the week are a little crazy sometimes ( we got the ellios burger one time , it was eh . ) but the brunch menu is my favorite ! the adult shakes are super yummy but i have to agree that the food quality has decreased since they have said they will be franchising . the service is ok--nothing spectacular . the server will come to your table about twice--to take your order and then take your money . good luck trying to get their attention any other time . i ' ll be back soon and will hope they start taking these reviews seriously ! 
went here for a company event recently was completely disappointed by my experience , although considering the general clientele there . . . i shouldn ' t be surprised . the bar area was mostly needlessly oversized and the decor was way outdated . waiter service was completely slow . you would have thought it was a busy night there , but it was mostly empty except for our party . i ordered the chef ' s calamari which came in some sort of an olive oil garlic sauce was excessively over seasoned , so i sent it back w no interest in a replacement . for an entree i had an encrusted tilapia dish which i thought would be a safe bet was recommended , but clearly i was wrong . this fish was not fresh or even prepared that day . i would guess it was straight out of a bj ' s wholesale club freezer . the taste was bland unfulfilling . there aren ' t many worthwhile places to eat at in this area , but this is right there at the bottom of the list . it ' s honestly no better than a fast food restaurant . poor and outdated ambiance and a dining experience you most certainly will want to pass on if presented the option . 
had dinner for the first time a few weeks ago at mie thai . extremely satisfied . i love that this restaurant is so vegetarian friendly - they had a whole vegetarian menu . ordered a mango drink that i wasn ' t too fond of esp for the price . tasted like the indian drink " frooti " - ready out of a container . wish they would modify their drink menu and include fresh cocktails and fresh frozen smoothies . the ambiance can be much better . it felt like a restaurant stuck in the early N ' s . the waiters very really friendly . will return for more ! 
this is good . really good . good enough that it ' s likely you ' ll come here and the parking lot will be mostly full with people waiting outside . yep - good ! i ' ll reiterate what everyone has said the menu is huge . that ' s horrible for me cause i ' m one of those chronic un-deciders when it comes to food , but alas , i ' ve only been here for breakfast so my choices have been easy . each item - pancakes , eggs and bacon , french toast , etc- was tasty , generous in portion and quick to the table . great service despite how busy the place always is . next on the list try those desserts from the case at the entry . shewwwww ! 
since the new owners took over , the food taste much better . . . . i only order food from this restaurant . . . . takeout . . . very tasty
the korean N-N . for N dollars , one can buy any korean meal that would cost up N buck . they also sell alcoholic beverages as long as you ' re N . i always stop but here for snack when i am in midtown . 
awesome lamb sandwich . that ' s what i usually get . the other stuff i had is excellent too . the bun is top notch . no complaints about the food . i am only disappointed that their hours are sketchy - i ' ve probably gone here about N times after noon only to find that stupid gate half-way shut or a sign in the window that says open at N N or more likely N N . the moral of my review is better call them before you go . if they kept consistent hours , N stars . minus N stars for all the disappointment and suffering you ' ve caused me . 
nook is a tiny place . yes , there is a solitary man taking care of all customers . but the food was beyond good . i loved the baguette with cheese and jam appetizer it sounded like a curious combination but it arrived beautifully plated and was easily devoured by all . my scramble was great , the potato pancakes on par , and the benedict good . 
if you don ' t decide to read my entire review . read this . avoid this cramped rat hole establishment like the black plague . food is junk , service is selective , based on age ? sex ? race ? no idea why we got the treatment we did ? never have i ever ! wow . left me speechless . worst service hands down in all of new york and possibly worst service i have ever received in my entire life ! reservations at N . we stood awkwardly at the door without being acknowledged for N minutes . when i finally said excuse me to the heavy set man who was checking in on table after table as he passed us , he looked irritated that i had interrupted him . wasn ' t this guy just a friendly person checking in on customers ? dr jekyll and mr . hyde ? ? glaring at me , he put one chubby sausage finger in the air as to silent me . . . say whaaaat ? ! around N N we were seated , no apologies , i can see they are busy no ? eye roll but i bit my tongue . what was the reservation for anyways ? he quickly sat the family of N who walked in after we had been waiting N minutes . he stumbled over the specials , lost his place and repeated himself , mentioned something about something being on his mind . yadiyada . . . we finally got our order in . when my stomach finally growled , i realized our appetizers had only arrived . we didn ' t realize because we were busy enjoying our conversation at the table . i flagged someone down who i thought could be our server , not too sure who it was since they came only to deliver the appetizer and never came back since . i asked about our main dishes and he left to " check " on it . no one came back . . N minutes go by and someone finally slammed our dishes down on our table , turned around and left , no apology , no explanation , nothing . . i started eating because i was so hungry , until i just had to say something the food was not good . i wasted my stomach on this when there is so much good food in ny , and not only that i had wasted N hours in this cramped corner with a table the size of my night stand . i called over the grumpy heavy set man again and he basically said the printer malfunctioned and that was that . also what else do i expect in nyc ? so it was my fault for eating there , i see . i had no problems with any of my reservations at other restaurants in new york at all . this review is already such a waste of my time . i won ' t give this place another moment of my previous time . save yourselves people . 
have all you people giving this place N stars tried the greek lady salad ? it ' s ridiculous . that with their homemade pita , hummus , and tzatziki heaven . 
i live right behind pizzeria vetri and was really excited about it opening in such a convenient location . unfortunately , i have to give one star for quality and customer service . i ' ve dined here a few times and have thought the pizza was just under mediocre and way too pricey for what you get which is burnt flatbread pizza with little to no toppings . if you want something similar that is way better quality , go to stella ' s . . . steven starr ' s gourmet pizzeria . although i ' m giving this is a negative rating and have mentioned i ' ve dined here a few times , i wanted to give them a couple chances to see if anything improved given it ' s a fairly new restaurant . my last time eating here was last night getting take out and coming home to an almost inedible pizza completely burnt on the bottom . . . and cold . meanwhile i live N . N seconds away behind the establishment . too tired and hungry to go back and complain the same night , i went back today with pics of my half eaten burnt pizza . the manager hostess ( not sure what her position was ) is extremely unfriendly and clearly doesn ' t care that a customer was dissatisfied with their N pizza . she looked at me like i had two heads , rolled her eyes and told me this is how their pizza is . . . sorry . no offer to refund me even after i said i wouldn ' t be dining there ever again . great customer service vetri ! ! i ' ll make sure to tell all my neighbors in my apt building and friends family not to dine with you . anyone looking for great quality pizza and good customer service , go to stella ' s or zavino ! - ) 
went for lunch and i had the italian steak sandwich it was terrific . nice wine selection . attentive staff , not over bearing . i suggest the balsamic calamari as an app . next time i will try the special mediterranean chicken salad my friend had . she loved it ! 
been here twice and had great service both times ! perfect service actually . great beer selection . nice outdoor seating in the summer . the food is pretty good . lobster , burgers , tuna over salad , mac and cheese . good bar food . much better than that over rated burger place down the street . 
the atmosphere of the rabbit hole actually deserves a five - especially in the summer with its vine draped patio . the interior is equally beautiful , having dark wooden-bar , lowly lit with chandalier- and candle-light . then , there is the food ! every item i have yet ordered is absolutely divine . last night , i ordered the red lentil soup and the red beet salad . i would definitely order each one again , though the red lentil soup was my favorite . the only thing that sets this restaurant back is that most main course items do not come with sides . you have to order everything a la cart , which makes a meal quite expensive . my soup and salad combo ended up being N-N . the perfect thing to do in this case is to share a salad and a sandwich with a friend but only if you want a light meal . the portions are quite moderate . that said , i already know what i will order next time . . . the black bean burger and the red beet salad . i have also been to the rabbit hole for breakfast , and i think this might be the best time to come . i ordered the breakfast sandwich both times i went there , because it is simply that delicious . oh , yes ! and it is also only N-N . although it doesn ' t come with any sides , it makes a good meal . 
what constitutes a good restaurant ? easy . satisfying food , an enjoyable atmosphere and a pleasant service experience that together combine to provide upon departure a feeling that you would certainly return . not rocket science is it ? so let us see how the single pebble did last night . food the single pebble seems to capitalize upon the fact that asian cuisine is not renowned in vermont . sitting at the bar , the wife and i started off with an order of pot stickers . thick pastry and overcooked filling . not a good start . the beef special on offer was quite delicious . tender pieces of well trimmed beef mixed with well prepared vegetables . the rice that accompanies the dish turned up N minutes after the dish was served , and then only after we reminded the staff it was was absent . second main dish appeared . apparently the spicy shrimp dish . not spicy , overcooked seafood and did i mention bland . not even soy or hoisin sauce ( if it were available ) could have resurrected this one . atmosphere sitting at the bar was our choice and not a problem . the single staff member running the bar took our order . the restaurant has a quirky layout due to it being a converted house and this adds something . sitting next to a busing station where dishes sit for N minutes does not . it has an acceptable atmosphere with dimly lit and tired decor . the service staff dressed in black adds a hint of ninja to the proceedings . . . if only . service the person running the bar became progressively busier over the course of the hour we were at the restaurant . creating drinks for the N other people in the place . patrons at the bar are then overlooked and no additional cover is provided for this sole bar person . empty dishes mount up on the bar , not just for us , and space is filling up . it was at this stage that i noticed a person pointing at me across the restaurant , the owner who was talking to a member of staff . as expected this person then turned up on my right shoulder asking if there was anything else we needed and would i like the bill . we were being moved along after less than an hour and N later . as we left , the owner shouted after us something as we stepped outside . summary the single pebble seems to capitalize upon the fact that asian cuisine is not renowned in vermont . that said , there is no excuse for poor service when customers are charged single pebble prices . 
yes , i love this place . the food is awesome . mussels are the best in the city . steak frites wonderful . salads are awesome . fair prices and great wine . excellent service every day from anna . but , monday is a different story service from that young french fellow . talk about sounding arrogance , short and unfriendly . 
vegetarian empanadas were delicious ! i had an app of sea scallops penne with mixed vegetables all outstanding flavors ! wait staff is very friendly timed apps entrees perfect . very cosy comfortable dim lit interior . me like ! 
love
the food at su xing house will not blow your mind . what is great about it is that you are able to have all those wonderful feelings of eating chinese food ( from your childhood ) but without the meat . most ( if not all ) of their stuff seems to be vegan . perhaps they throw in some egg or butter somewhere but for the most part , you ' re good . the price point is insanely low for this section of the city . there aren ' t many places with a lunch special like this one . for a low price , you get soup , entree , rice and a spring roll , with all the tea and duck sauce you can drink . on a recent trip , i was pleasantly surprised by the lotus root soup . i doctored it up with a bit of white pepper and it was nearly perfect . i ' m partial to the homestyle bean curd but i haven ' t ever gotten them to prepare me something " spicy " i feel like each time i ask for it they just sort of chuckle and never actually do it . so , i ' ve eaten here a number of times and will continue to . it ' s an inexpensive lunch option and the food is tasty , in that " i want to feel guilty about eating chinese " way . 
every time i go to new york i eat here , great food
we ' ve been here five times and gotten in only twice . the waiting time is absolutely horrible . it ' s too small of a restaurant for so many people to be waiting large amounts of time . we ' ve left very disappointed the last three times we went there , because we couldn ' t get in and the wait time was over an hour ! the lobby area was packed and the line was out the door . this is a pizza parlor after all ! there ' s no reason for such a long wait . their pizzas , sorry , tomatoe pies , are excellent but when the kitchen is overwhelmed , which is often , it ' s not out of the question to be waiting N minutes for your pizza ! that ' s after you ' ve already had two drinks and appetizers and you wait an additional N-N minutes for your main course ! we like the food but they need to work on the speed of moving tables and food delivery . 
pretty good but did not have an extensive list of wines . pizza was good though nothing too special . i ordered the stache , it was an untraditional mix of flavors for me . service was ok , although the waitress seemed annoyed if you didn ' t order something else every time she came by . 
a few weeks ago , i finally got a chance to sit down for a meal here . i went in with a group of my coworkers while we were waiting for our phone internet to come back up and didn ' t want to go far while we waited for the verizon tech . it was pretty empty for a friday afternoon . i guess the newness has worn off of this place because they were jam packed for the first few weeks they were open . anyway , we got a table near the window and looked over the menu . N sandwiches , a burger , and N salads plus a bunch of beer were ordered . honestly , it would have been pretty hard to mess up our orders , so there ' s no complaints on that part . what was killing me was how long everything seemed to take . mind you , it was all but empty in the restaurant . it just felt like for-freaking-ever between when we ordered and when we finally got our food . in reality , the whole meal took like an hour and a half . . . but see , that would have been totally unacceptable had i not been with my boss . i totally get that things take longer when a restaurant is busy , but would not work as an excuse the day we were there . a handful of people at the bar and N tables is nowhere near capacity for this place , so there ' s really no excuse for why it would take so long to get our food out to us . and speaking of food , it was just ok . i ' ve heard rumblings of discord between the owners , but that is not an excuse to let the quality of your food suffer . it wasn ' t even that the food was bad , because it wasn ' t . it ' s that it was . . . ok . the franklin steakhouse in nutley has a great reputation , so this is really disappointing . i ate every bite of my salad ( with avocado and grilled shrimp , yum ) , but it just wasn ' t as spectacular as i had hoped it would be considering adding shrimp to the salad nearly doubled the price of it . i would never turn down a meal here if someone else was paying , but really , i ' m kind of over it . also , on a side note , the parking here is awful . the lot is decent sized for regular business , but it is way too small and the entrances too narrow for happy hour or other times where it gets busy . 
chive pork fried dumplings that i ordered were pretty good . 
this place is great ! i love the kale pesto and N dollar bottles of wine ! bravo
i love the atmosphere at barn joo . i ' ve been here a few times for dinner and also for events on two occasions . it feels rustic and cozy and the food is great too . don ' t come expecting authentic , authentic korean fare , but enjoy the unique twists on classic dishes . my favorite item is an appetizer with a piece of sashimi on a sesame leaf ( aka " perilla " or in korean this is called gaen-ip ) called " yellowtail on the green " -- this is a must try in my opinion . the wings are also great extra crispy , not too sticky or spicy . at happy hour , they ' re a great deal , too . barn joo is cool departure from the k-town scene ( which i also enjoy , but for different reasons ) . 
my neighborhood restaurant my husband and i stop in oneN about once a week . the food is great - always some interesting specials - cooking with seasonal ingredients . i enjoy the soups and fresh salads but every now and then i have to go for the grilled flat iron steak with chimichuri sauce and fries with truffled mayo - yum ! suggestions - take a seat at the bar and let craig take care of you . 
i came here expecting the best pizza ever because of the tv shows and what not . um , it isn ' t that great . trust being a new yorker there ' s definitely way better pizza out there . i mean don ' t get me wrong its good , but its not over the top i want to eat everyday pizza . i might go there again to give it another try , but i might not as well . i mean go , try it yourself but don ' t say i didn ' t warn you . 
i rarely spend N for an entree , but this was well worth it . i hadn ' t ordered pork from a menu in N years , but could not resist the pork chop on a mound of creamy polenta . the meal more than lived up to expectations with wilted bok choy and soft pear in a hearty jus . the chop was exquisitely cooked - thick , evenly cooked and charred on both sides . we also got the farro risotto which i wouldn ' t have named as such but offered delicious aroma of cream , stock and herbs . the vegetarian tart was hearty with a perfect crust . maybe not the most exciting thing on the menu , but unique . service was fantastic , with one small exception- we tried to get drinks at the bar prior to our reservation . even after finally sitting in front of the bartender , it took him N minutes to acknowledge us . hire backup- poor guy was also providing cocktails for the whole dining room . finally , the the complimentary dark chocolate cookie with salted toffee was the perfect bite to end a perfectly executed meal ! thanks perilla . 
i ' m not a sushi fanatic or anything , and i won ' t eat anything raw , but i had both the tempura appetizer and california roll and i thought they were both very good . the service was decent , but N off sushi . . how can you beat that ? i would definitely go again ! nice spot to meet friends after work . the crappy part is having to put money in the parking meter until Npm because the parking lot fills up quickly ! 
i grew up eating calandra ' s delicious desserts . now i ' ve been living in hoboken the past N years and can ' t find anything comparable . i don ' t understand why people stand in line for hours at some average tasting bakery here in town . whenever i ' m back in the old neighborhood visiting family i make a stop in caldwell or fairfield for the best tasting cupcakes ever ! 
i ' m rarely totally happy with anything . and after searching for a parking spot this past sunday night for over N minutes , i was expecting to continue my history . however i loved it . i really did . the food was fabulous the service was excellent and the prices were surprisingly reasonable ( and i ' m known for cheap ) . a little noisy , but not uncomfortably so . and just great food . barbecued salmon , calamari and N large shrimp . perfect . and my girlfriend , joodles , felt the same about her dinner ( which i also shared ) . we shall return again soon , but will walk this time . 
love this place . delicious . homemade . great atmosphere . 
i have been all over the city and nothing beat this place . yummmmmm ! best pizza ever . 
mediocre food , inattentive wait staff , generally unorganized . i went with group of N for lunch and one person ' s food came N minutes after everyone else ' s . the staff didn ' t seem to care and gave no explanation and weren ' t apologetic . 
dingy , dark , scruffy bar scene , kind of crowded - the best burger i ' ve had since i moved to the city . the burger is nice and thick ( cooked to your preferred temp ) . friendly staff , and they do have a couple tv ' s with sports usually on . update i ' ve continued to eat here a few more times - this burger is great - bottom line ! ( as long as you can get a table ) 
made a reservation here for Nam on a sunday morning for a small , family brunch . cocktails weren ' t available yet by the time we sat down , but the coffee and juices were very good . the service was great , very welcoming and warm . the food was priced pretty much in keeping with the neighborhood and the food was good . standouts included grits and the beef shortrib eggs benedict . i would definitely return for brunch here , probably once cocktails were available though . 
two of us arrived at Npm on a saturday and were seated in about N minutes . nice . ordered raw scallops and oysters to start . very fresh , great flavor and enjoyed the accompanying sauces . friend got the special ( branzino with mashed potatoes some other stuff ) , and it was delicious . i got the pigeon entree , a delightful option as i love pigeon but it ' s so hard to find places that serve it ! meat was tender ( like duck but slightly gamier , according to my companion ) , the sauce was tasty ( dark , almost a bit earthy ? ) , and i loved the mashed sweet potatoes . except . . . i was almost done with the dish and was working my way through a mouthful of mashed sweet potatoes when i pulled what looked like a piece of tape out of my mouth . um . . . i handed it off to the waiter . the manager came over , was very apologetic and comped my entree and gave us a free dessert . i didn ' t make a big deal of it . ( but i was sad that i couldn ' t finish my sweet potatoes lol ) we selected the chocolate bruno for our dessert , and it was just . . . gluttony . a super-dense , super-fudgy ( and relatively sizable ) flourless chocolate cake with three deliciously silky scoops of ice cream ( two vanilla , one chocolate ) . 
loved the crostini and house made pastas ! for the quality of food the price is very reasonable . great ambiance and friendly staff ! will be coming back here soon ! 
great price , great food
the best pizza in the area ! i mean overall all of their food is good but their pizza . . . . just wow . recently they started delivering and its fantastic . the sicilian is hands down the best in nj but their round pie rivals benny ' s in hoboken . baked ziti is good , eggplant parm is good , the chicken parm sandwich is good , could use more sauce but that ' s the only complaint . service is always good whether at the counter , booth or in the more ' formal ' dining in the back . answering the phone is never really an issue , they ' re prompt with that too . as far as italian places go this is well worth it . 
oh dar how i love thee . . . let me count the ways N ) for your tabouli so fresh and so tastey N ) for your bread so light and so flakey N ) for you hummus that will never be wasted N ) for the hot manager who sadly is taken i can ' t get enough of all that you have , i ' ll come back for more as much as i can ! i ' m obviously not a poet but damn the food is so good i couldn ' t help myself . this is the first review i ' ve ever written . great addition to the neighborhood ! 
the thing that makes this restaurant so great is their service . they have such nice and attentive wait staff , and the bartender was so friendly . the food was pretty good about N stars , but their service pushed me to give them N stars . great date restaurant . 
i went there twice in a week . weekend weekday . but each time make me so disappoint . i think you shouldn ' t go there with a group ! poor management ! they cannot make a table for four people . we had to wait N hours to be seated , even though we came there earlier to put our name on the waiting list and were told the wait would be one hour . more than N couples went before us ! the food was so delicious . i love the interior . the server shige ' s table service was excellent . but i will not recommend to go there with a group . ) 
the food was very mediocre . to start we had the dumplings , which were thin and not very flavorful as well as the butternut squash soup ( a special ) , that was very watery . i guess the only plus of the appetizers were that they were not too filling . the trout , that was served with broccoli rabe and beets sounded like an excellent combination but turned out to be very bland . the mustard that it was served with added nothing but watery yellowness . the only thing that was decent was the mahi ( a special ) . the staff was not particularly friendly , and at the end of our meal seemed to be rushing us to finish our wine ( byob ) since we were not ordering dessert . if you are looking for an average meal at an okay price and byob then this is your place . 
good cuban food , can ' t go wrong with anything on the menu . where you can go wrong is by expecting to be seated right away and a quiet atmosphere . out of the N or so times i ' ve attempted to dine here , i ' ve only succeeded N times . once there was a N hour wait , you read that right . . . N hours ! so come early if you want to eat . 
awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
the falafel is good . . but the owners are rude and not friendly . the girl working there . . . she ' s either the man ' s wife or daughter is sooo rude . . she doesn ' t even say thank you or look at you when she takes your money and gives you change . been there twice and same deal both times . it amazes me how people can be so unappreciative and still stay in business . 
the food is excellent . the service is good as well . it ' s a hidden gem on a little street in st george . i recommend it all the time . 
N N for this amazing spot ! ! i ended up here by accident for lunch and ended up stayin for much longer . the beer menu was one of the best i ' ve ever seen and i ' m very hard to please . i ordered the chicken buffalo wrap with fries and it was awesome . staff were also N N , were very friendly and the manager was excellent , she came over to myself and my friend , we got talking about beers etc and wow she was impressive , certainly knows her stuff ! ! we will definitely be coming back here ! ! 
a great mix of ex pats and locals . never had a bad night there . staff are very friendly and food tastes great . being smokefree and a western toilet would give it a N N but when in china . . . . 
came with my wife last week and we loved it ! it was a tuesday and we arrived at around N N pm not expecting it to be that crowded at the time but we notice the packed parking lot . as we walked in , we saw to our left the packed bar scene ( not rowdy ) but a little loud so we requested to sit in the middle room which didn ' t bother the maitre ' d at all . they have a nice wine list but we ordered cocktails instead . for appetizer we had the french onion soup and the fried calamari which were very tasty . for dinner we had the angel hair pommeray and my wife had the herb crusted salmon . i would like to add here that the dinner portions are very generous ! neither of us finished our dinners but we took them home . the salmon was done perfectly , crispy on the outside but very moist on the inside ( in fact our waiter told us that ' s how the chef does it and he was spot on ) . the angel hair pommeray was delicious it had a little touch of mustard seed which offset the subtle sweetness of the sauce . lot ' s of scallops and shrimp too . no room for dessert . . . so we sat a few moments to enjoy the music and took off . on our way out we noticed dancing and a great singer sax player had arrived later on the night . at the bar . overall a lot of good food and seems like fun entertainment , i ' m glad i tried it out
really cool brunch spot . everything was on point . staff is super friendly and we really enjoyed ourselves . it is super tiny so make sure you call ahead . can ' t wait to go back ! 
the pizza is good if you asked for it cooked light . if you don ' t you will get a burnt pizza . the sauce and cheese are good , thats why you are paying an arm and a leg for it . very expensive
we clearly ordered the wrong things here . it ' s hard to know how this place got so many N stars unless we were wrong in what we ordered . beware of the following daikon salad - just strange . the daikon , other veggies and plum dressing were all acceptable , but there was some other flavor we couldn ' t place . it permeated even the raw daikon . maybe something the veggies were soaked in ? it was almost chemical tasting . husband ate it because he thought it was weird , but i didn ' t bother wasting more than one bite on this . pretty plate though . nasu shoga itame - sauteed eggplant with ginger sauce . this was good . the chunks of eggplant were very large , and i think they should have been smaller because the large chunks end up being huge bites of mush in your mouth . but otherwise , the sauce was tasty . fried avocado skewers - this was not good or bad . slices of avocado , breaded with tempura and deep fried . served with more avocado , kind of like a flavorless guacamole , on the side . three skewers per plate . if you mix the soy sauce and some of the other sauces on the table and pour over the skewer , there is enough flavor to make it edible . that is all . tofu curry - beyond bad . no portion of this plate worked . the curry itself tasted like brown gravy mixed with indian spices . weird and gelatinous . the tofu was a very soft , wet tofu that was cut into large pieces that were incredibly gelatinous as well . completely inedible . the inside of the tofu looked like the white of a raw egg . the tofu had been lightly fried , which created a skin on the outside . seriously . it felt like skin . the white rice on the plate was sticky but completely flavorless . while the service was ok at the beginning , once the bill was presented the waiter disappeared for at least N minutes . when we took the bill to the front and asked someone else to run the card , they asked us to please be seated while they located our waiter . which took another N minutes . overall not as pleasant of a dining experience as we hoped . 
i ate at mamma rosa ' s last night . when we drove up to the place , we were unsure whether to give it a try , but all four of us are thrilled we did . the owner , gino , was so welcoming . it almost felt like being in italy . we ate outside , and that worked well for us - not at all noisy . we had two appetizers - the artichokes were excellent , the roasted pepper and mozzarella was very fresh , but needed more flavor for my taste . these were entree size portions . we had N entrees . all were very good , but the standout has to be the eggplant parmesan . this dish is one i usually don ' t care for as its typically too heavy . at mamma ' s , it was light and incredibly flavorful . even the bread that was served was very good , as was the seasoned olive oil . nice deserts too , and to cap it all , very reasonably priced . highly recommended
how many of you who love this place have been to italy ? it is a bad red sauce house with huge portions of not very good , nor very fresh tasting food . avoid the fish at all costs . a lot of garlic and cheap cooking oil pervade every dish . 
jose garces is truly amazing with his restaurant concepts and food . amada has authentic style spanish tapas ( many tasting exactly like i had in spain ) but for higher prices than you ' d find in spain . it is a great place for romantic or special occasion dinners . i would also recommend trying amada out during restaurant week so you get to try an assortment of the dishes for a smaller price . 
i have gluten intolerance so you would think i ' d be a fan . i don ' t think i ' ll ever go back to risotteria . i visited on august Nth during the lunch hour . i begged my friend to come with me ( he eats gluten ) and i was overjoyed when he agreed . it ' s so rare that i eat pizza ! we ' d both visited the restaurant last year . i loved it then . he didn ' t think it was great . this time our waitress was truly a snob . she gave me still water when i asked for sparkling , made it clear she did not appreciate our menu choices , and ignored us for most of our meal . overall , bad vibes from the whole experience . honestly , i make better pizza . theirs was too starchy- the dough was so chewy it stuck to my teeth . why drag your gluten-eating friends here and deal with attitude and lack luster gf cooking ? make it at home ! and do something else with your N . 
italian food is kind of a high bar for me because it ' s pretty easy to cook it yourself . this place was fine , but not amazing . the eggplant parm appetizer was good as was the buccatini . it was actually lovely . but the gnocchi was very mediocre . i don ' t get what the fuss is about . all in all this restaurant is an inoffensive cute choice but the food is okay , not spectacular by any means . N stars seemed harsh , but N seems a little generous . the waitstaff is lovely so i rounded up . 
great service , small place , but the food was outstanding . the crepes are huge and they will fill you up . this place is way better than most crepes places , i can ' t wait to go back for more ! 
we got the half chicken and half lamb halal rice plate . it is a ridiculous amount of food . you can easily split it with another person . i think the half half is nice . even though the food is delicious , packed with umami flavors , it gets monotonous after a while . it comes with soft pita bread and seasoned orange rice . you have to use the white ranch-like dressing . the hot sauce is insanely hot . we only put a little bit on , but we were dying from the heat . use sparingly ! 
the three roll special is their mainstay and the fish is always tasty . all the same , longtime customers can note a drop in service quality and a hike in wait times . a strange note i tried their dumplings for the first time two days ago and they tasted bitter and metallic . the rest of the night , i couldn ' t get the metallic taste out of my mouth . it hasn ' t gone away yet not sure , but i think the dumplings gave me pine mouth ! ! ! 
haven ' t been this giddy about a place in a while ! is this what falling in love is like ? ? if so , i will take it with strong sangria -- which alta does and does right . everything we tried was good . this does not happen in most tapas places i have been to , even the well reviewed ones ( ie boqueria ) . best dishes fried goat cheese with lavender-infused honey yes . over and over please . i don ' t care if i was inappropriately moaning while consuming this . not all fried foods are created equally , and just because you fry something does not make it automatically good . this is very lightly fried with a thin just crispy outside and the goat cheese melts in your mouth . perfect . and yes , the lavender honey makes a real difference in this dish . crispy brussels sprouts with apples , pistachios these are the only brussels sprouts i ' ve had that are comparable to ilili ' s amazing roasted brussels sprouts . the ilili one is drenched in a yogurt based sauce , which makes it quite heavy . these are much lighter , even though there is some creme fraiche in them , they are not too filling . so good i wanted to order another plate . bacon wrapped dates thanks to another yelper , i requested this with dates only , and they accommodated even though our waiter said he never got that request before . it was great - bite sized dates with crispy bacon wrapped around was a perfect combination of salty and sweet . i ' m not one to think that adding bacon automatically makes everything better , but in this case , it was so right . seared sea scallops the order comes with N , and they are jumbo sized and very well cooked . delicious . less awesome but very good dishes char-grilled eggplants with shallots this had a nice smokey flavor from the grill , and it was actually a very good eggplant dish . i love eggplant and have had a lot of good eggplant dishes , so i would not re-order this next time . lamb meatballs i ' m glad we got these , it was a last minute order because they forgot our duck , but by then we were too full for a big dish . we opted to try these instead , and they were very soft and well flavored . much better than the meatballs i had at pylos . it also didn ' t taste gamey at all , and they were smaller than i expected , which was good for our stomachs at that point . pan roasted striped bass also a great seafood option , the skin was nicely crispy and the carrot puree was just lovely i can ' t put this in the best dish section as good as it was , because it was a bit small for the price of N . N . our waiter , who was great , did warn us that it was a small portion and recommended the salmon instead . i try not to order salmon most places because it ' s usually unimpressive , but i would consider it next time since i trusted his judgment . sangria is extremely strong , one glass was more than enough for a weekday dinner . if there ' s one thing you can skip here , it would be the dessert . we got the grand marnier custard and the apple confit . they were just okay - i liked the apple a little more , the warm apple slices were nice with the ice cream . the custard was a goopy mess . i would have preferred to try two more plates instead of the dessert . besides the desserts , all the plates were excellent - nothing was bad . what separated the best dishes for me is likely a matter of personal preference in food . i ' ll have trouble next time deciding between getting the dishes i loved last time , and trying new dishes . maybe the charm will wear off eventually , but for now i am smitten and i cannot wait to go back . 
do yourself a favor . . . just order dumplings . skip everything else . the noodles are just okay . but the dumplings are the best . especially the soup dumplings . the chive and pork dumplings are excellent , too . 
i normally do not write on yelp but because of the experience i had , i have to let everyone know what this place really is about . the food is ok . not the best like most people here are saying . katana-ya in san francisco beats it by far . the service here is absolutely awful . the host had attitude , the waiter was rude and just tossed the food on the table without a smile or asking how we were doing . on top of this , the table was sticky . the health grade for this location is pending ( previously c ) because of totto ' s history of storing dishes in the restroom . i checked the restroom and they no longer have dishes there so kudos for them for reading the reviews and fixing their problem on that issue . however because of the poor service i did not give the big tip i normally do . the waiter upon receiving the bill , count the amount and the tip in front of my face . he then threw it and not handed to my table and said that it was not enough . i was applauded by this reaction and did not spoke a word and left . the food here was good but certainly not worth the wait . but to those who think this place is like heaven , i do not feel the any food no matter how good it is is worth the service and " rude-ness " given here . in case if the owner is reading this , the host was a white guy with bread in his Ns-Ns and the waiter i had was this tall asian guy with long brown hair . i know you guys will always be busy regardless of what you do but if you what to be a good human being please work on your service totto . 
impeccable food without the pretentious attitude although in this case they ' d be allowed the sassiness ( they ' re food is that good . ) i ' d like to say i was carbing up for the marathon the next day , alas , t ' was not . rather , i was going for that serotonin overload that only the gt pasta with chanterelles , sweet cream , and even sweeter corn can give one . this was after a date with the bread basket mind you . i started with the arugula salad which illustrates how dreamy the gt staff is i abhor when diners make alterations to menus . i totally understand chef has a vision , and one should not monkey around with that vision no matter what your aversions . . . . . if you don ' t like something in a dish , order something else . well leave it to me , whom has a propensity toward the dramatics , to voice my utter sadness when finding out , as i read the menu , that the arugula salad was tainted by the absurd turnip for the evening ? root vegetables , in my opinion , are wrong and taste like dirty , old library books . i wish people would quit trying to put them in my food . nevertheless , i wouldn ' t dare ask them to change the salad . our waiter though heard my tirade and quickly ( like a mother trying the shut her bratty baby up ) told me they ' d be happy to make a salad without turnips for me . it was outstanding with a saffron dressing , and the perfect little currants to dance with the lettuce . for dessert they made a most heavenly cheese plate , where i was still trying to lick my fingertips after we paid the bill . 
the place is overrated . they built a name for them selves and now they just rely on that . for some reason they think that their pizza is so special . they keep people crowded outside however there are plenty of opened talbles inside . besides we had four people N boys and a girl . they sat us in a small table howevery the bigger tables were free . after we asked to be reseated and we were told --no . waiter dropped the food on the table and walked away no bon appetite , no enjoy your pizza . waiters at this place are rude and even dont pick up the empty bottles . we paied N for N large pizzas with four drinks , no alochol . guys ! ! ! ! ! ! ! never go to this place . save you time and money . 
buyer beware ! this experience starts with an extremely rude phone receptionist followed by a N minute hold . after ordering a simple chicken club which was repeated twice we put the phone down and waited . N minutes later what arrived was in fact not a chicken club but a fried chicken with melted mozzarella cheese sandwich . after grimacing in disgust at the " joey ' s " version of a " chicken club " i decided to give into my hunger after a long days hike , what happened next was unbelievable . . as i bit into this so called " chicken club " my mouth became immediately dry , so dry in fact i had to physically stand up on two feet an walk to the kitchen to pour a glass of water as the dry crusted bread stuck to my tonsils . weather or not my tonsils are harmed has yet to be determined . the sandwich tasted like it had be sitting on top of the roof all day melting by sun and heat created by the black tar . so a paying customer i went against my morals and decided that the so called " chicken club " was just inedible and in fact may cause bodily harm to my esophagus on the way down , therefore i decided to call back joeys pizza . unfortunately i wish it stopped there . . . we kindly reiterated that there may had been some mix up with the sandwiches and although we repeated the order twice to the phone receptionist there must have been a misinterpretation between the cook and the english terminology of a " chicken club " sandwich . yes i agree most people would say " hey i think your in the wrong line of work " but even so we disregarded the fact that they could not comprehend the mere makings of a " club " sandwich - bread-chicken-bacon-lettuce-mayo we even left the tomato out to simplify it for einstein cooking behind the counter . their answer . . . . . that there was a bite taken , and we would not be reimbursed monetarily or with a new sandwich . joeys your like school on a saturday , " no class " - customer satisfaction appreciation and service are key in your industry . . you fall short in all N areas . ill be surprised if this isn ' t the last N star review . thanks for the dog food though . 
ok here it goes . . . ricotta cheese on grilled bread perfect arugala salad very tasty- nice touches lamb sliders , joey campanaro watch your step these might be better - the goat cheese roll takes ti over the top ravioli with the robiola cheese is one great noodle which is stuffed perfectly , not too much , not too little . the malati or whatever the uneven flat pasta with the pesto is called is seriously a great pasta light , but flavorful pesto . porchetta is tender , fatty , ande flavorful . . . pure peasant delight . . the lightly dressed radichio arugala goes well to cut the fattyness . . . the side of potaoes is not to be missed . . . toasted , fried with garlic oil . . whatever . . . really special the focaccia is the lightest with a hint of tomato sauce on top is great for scapping up the sauces . the wine list is varied priced gentle . the cake with the raspberry pistaccio was moist , light worked with a buttermilk gelati illy coffee nice staff professional only con the bus staff tends to want to grab stuff off the table too fast . the wait staff does not rush you , but they do want to at these price points , need to turn tables . we recommend we will be back
this is a great place to have a ( good ) beer , on draft or in bottle . i appreciate that they support local craft breweries . the staff i ' ve dealt with have been accommodating . the atmosphere is updated and lively . i have not had any of the food , but i don ' t think you ' d be disappointed coming here for a beer . 
oh my , what lovely balls you have ! i tried the falafel for lunch and it was divine . i got it with " just tahini and lots of balls . " while i ' m not a spicy food eater , i think it would have been better had i gotten some spicy sauce with it . there ' s a lovely counter of sides and toppings you can add yourself . N for the meal and it was very filling . cash only , they have an atm in the restaurant if you ' re desperate ! 
ha . two offensive things from my ordering process to my digestive process . N . " speak english " sign is plastered right in the front of their window . standing near his sign lies a man who looks almost like an italian immigrant sticking up for a country that taxes the living crap out of him . and sir , if you are serving " good " food , you need to understand that real good food does not discriminate . N . i don ' t know if it was just my batch , but the steak was dry and incredibly chewy . other than that , the cheesesteak was not bad ! i wish they had the option of mushrooms , or had more onions on the thing but these are just personal preferences . despite a long ( but quick ) moving line , i gave geno ' s a chance . disappointed with a distaste for the racial mentality and steak , i give my crown to philly ' s cheesesteak wit wiz to the boys across the way . 
to put it simply . . . i don ' t understand why this joint is four stars . plus , for a new haven business , N prior reviews seems to be a substantial volume . i must have gone in with some wildly inflated expectations . that ' s not to say that we didn ' t enjoy our meal of one margherita and one white clam pie with a house salad . the amount of grub was significant , even though we ordered two smalls i considered packing up half our leftovers to go , but reconsidered since the bottoms were droopy even fresh out of the oven . and although the service was quite prompt , there wasn ' t much in the way of friendliness by any of the staff . everyone we interacted with was quite brusque and businesslike , which i found unusual for a small business . and for two pizzas , a salad , and two beers , our total ran us roughly N . don ' t expect to leave without a dent in your wallet . this is definitely a step up from a fast food joint , to be sure . but i ' m uncompelled to recommend a visit here to anyone looking for a standout pie . 
i wish i could give standard tap N stars . i am in love with the octopus and order it almost exclusively when i visit . however , my most recent visit deeply disappointed me to the point where i am unsure whether to return . we had a group of N and made it clear to our server that N in our party were vegan and one was severly allergic to pinapple . another person in our party ordered a pinapple flavored beer and the server stated that she wasn ' t sure which beer was which , but she would pull out an epi-pen if she needed to . not cool- we should have left after this incident . the two people in my group ( one who was allergic to pinapple and ordered an ipa , and the other that wanted the pineapple beer ) very hesitantly sipped the pints that were placed in front of them- the server stated that they looked and smelled the same and she couldnt tell which was which . the man who was allergic to pineapple felt his tongue tingling and immediately gave his beer to another person in our party . the server did not check on this , offer to bring a new beer , appologize , or do anything to act like she cared . also , the vegans ordered chickpea sandwiches after specifying that they did not want any dairy , and cheese was served on both . my octopus was extremely overcooked and i felt so let down . the server seemed to be flip-flopping with another server and they both brought out our dishes- whether they were drunk or just incompetent is a mystery , but sauce from one plate ended up all over my shoes and the floor without so much as an appology from the carefree server who plopped it on the table . standard , step up your game or i will not be returning . 
we went on friday after hearing about some " growing pains " stories and had a very good experience . kevin was our server and he was friendly , attentive , and took great care of us . we felt as if we were old friends . we will definitely be back and look forward to playing mini golf when it ' s open ! 
pylos is a fantastic greek gem hidden on a fantastic food block in the east village . everything from it ' s warm , cozy interior to it ' s not too large dining area to it ' s authentic cuisine from tasty meatballs , domades , lamb chops , whole fish ( simply prepared ) to it ' s impressive greek-filled wine list . it ' s hard to find good greek in manhattan ( astoria is the best ! ) but i think pylos is amongst the best , especially for the money . overall a great , romantic date joint that won ' t break the bank . tip go to desnuda for a cozy glass of wine afterwards ! 
i went here with my husband by chance - we were just passing by and it was a good thing to because we had one of the best bolognese sauces we have ever had . we keep coming back and each time we argue over who gets to order it and who had to try something new . if you are in the neighborhood give this place a try - the ravioli ( which they change daily ) is always good . 
it ' s ridiculous how inexpensive this place is . my friend and i ordered enough dumplings to stuff us both for only N ! some were a little greasy , but delicious nonetheless . it ' s exactly what you want out of cheap asian street food - excited tastebuds and a warm , full belly . my favorite was the fried pork and chive dumpling , but all were good . definitely recommended . 
this restaurant recently opened and it already seems to have already established a clientele . they were quite busy both times we went . the d cor and atmosphere are great and the waitresses are very helpful - especially since i wanted to order off the chinese menu and i can ' t read chinese . the chinese menu , which many chinese restaurants have is a few pages and you have to ask for it . i asked the waitresses to please explain the dishes and make recommendations . the double cooked pork ( hwei gwo rou ) when done in real chinese style is great ! we also had spare ribs and bitter melon which i really liked . having bitter melon with anything really doesn ' t get me too excited , but i ' m so glad we tried it - i will definitely order this dish again . we frequent flushing and my wife commented " this place is great and so much closer than flushing - let ' s come her instead of going to flushing " . we will definitely be back . 
sensational . food is top notch beautiful , delicious , well paced . i never saw , do i remember any staff - which is perfect - stay away from me let me eat . i ' ll be back , a lot . 
i was only in philadelphia for a weekend . and several people told me to go to el vez . everyone said it was fun and the drinks were great and the food was even better . after hearing all the hype maybe i had high expectations just waiting to be unmet . but i felt like the restaurant was a ok . just like it says for three stars . a ok . not as great as everyone said but pretty darn good . we had nachos and tacos . very tasty . i think what bothered me most was sort of how gimicky the place felt to me . a lot of young people that were drunk and loud . and also some old people that were wealthy and snobby . it ' s not el vez ' s fault . this i know . but it did affect the experience . 
this is my favorite place for breakfast brunch . it ' s hugely popular so be prepared to wait on the weekends--but it ' s definitely worth the wait ! great food , great coffee , and sometimes great service . 
spinach , homemade meatballs , provolone omelette . this place is awesome . friendly . welcoming . we will be coming back . this is great italian family place ! loved it so much ! 
yes , cocktails here is tasty strong , but food ! i ordered a jumbo shrimp cocktail for N , and got N ( four ) shrimp ! ! N shrimp for N ! ! N , N per shrimp ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and shrimps were not giant at all ! the amount of sauce was bigger ( ( and my friends ordered a burgers , same N , and got so much bigger plate , it was soo weird and unfair ( it ' s definatly not a place for smb , who does not eat meat . N stars only for cocktails and atmosphere . 
really good food--although i think the drinks are way overpriced . service is usually hit or miss . i like this place for lunch the most , since the bar upstairs is really small , so you are usually smushed somewhere and constantly moving to let servers go by . 
the food here was amazing and so was the service ! we came here with a guest from senegal and he was smiling ear to ear ! ! try the chicken yassa or five star seafood
delicious dinner . i had the prix-fixe special with a pappardelle appetizer , hangar steak entree , and brownie dessert for N . after N glasses of wine , though the bill came to N . while good , i don ' t think it was N good . the bartender was sweet and made small talk as the owner or manager sat next to me and ran through the finances with an investor of sorts . interesting conversation to listen in on . 
not only is the food delicious , but the service was wonderful . patrick , the general manager , goes above and beyond to ensure a pleasant experience . the menu is intricate , but he took an extensive amount of time to provide answers , guidance and recommendations . the atmosphere is lively and fun . boqueria is such a great spot ! 
to begin , the coffee here is great- and if that ' s all you want , def worth a visit . if , on the other hand , you want some food , might want to go to one of the neighborhood diners for a better meal-at half the price . ordered eggs over easy with some smoked salmon . the salmon that they served looked like leftover pieces of salmon jerky . thick and crusty and hard . the waiter took it back , and when it came out the second time , the salmon was fresh and excellent ( the way it should have been in the first place ) but the eggs were literally uncooked , white was mostly clear . ate the salmon , not the eggs-- and the waiter ( who was excellent and sympathetic ) took the eggs off the bill . we ' ll probably go back cause it ' s in the hood and it ' s a good vibe for weekend breakfast , but hopefully they will upgrade the qc in the kitchen . 
this is a very cool urban style restaurant in an authentic old corner property . it had a beautiful cherry in blossom outside which was superb . the complimentary bruschetta is a nice touch as is the bread and tomato pesto style dressing which is topped up during the meal . the caprese salad is superb - my wife catherine had the red beet salad which was also very good . they make the simple sublime . we both had pasta entrees and both were similarly good . i would go N . N if the system would allow . being byo keeps the cost down and the waitress is charming . parking can be tough - but worth it . 
i eat at yama at least N-N times a week . their miso soup is delicious . i ' ve had all of their sushi rolls and they are really good . the service is always very quick . the food quality and portions are always consistent . the yama in hanover is almost as good with a different environment . either way i would highly recommend to any one eating at both . 
when we arrived there was a huge crowd waiting for tables , but we were seated in about half an hour . our pizza arrived piping hot and fresh , but i felt they skimped on the toppings . overall a great experience , and we ' ll be back , especially with out of town visitors . 
the soup dumpling is good enough compared with some other restaurant in philly . don ' t have a cart so it is not the typical cantonese dim sum that i expected . 
underwhelming at best . found the food mediocre and predictable . over priced , but was a nice place to sit . service was adequate . probably wont be back . 
i love , love , love it here . i love that there are only a few options . when i ' m hungry , really hungry , i don ' t want to sit down , look at a lengthy menu and try to determine what i ' m hungry for -- when i go to pho N , the decision ' s already made . all i have to say is " small beef , please , " and minutes later a delicious bowl of soup ready for me to eat ( or customize to my tastes ) arrives . it can get busy , but the turnover is usually startlingly quick . you ' re also welcome to take out your soup if you want , making the wait nonexistent . they do accept credit cards . my only complaint is that they aren ' t open N N , and that i don ' t live right next door . 
grilled corn . all i have to say . oh , and the rest of the food is pretty damn good , too . recommend the huevos rancheros ! ! ! ! ! 
love this local cafe - delicious drinks nibbles , complemented by a fun atmosphere and great service . try the paninis . 
spaghetti al limone - so good we should have gotten two of them . it looks simple but it ' s really amazing . i even converted a friend who doesn ' t like lemon . bruschetta- simple but delicious . they grill the bread which is key . the tomatoes are fresh ( which in the early winter is hard to find ) . just a really nice flavor . tagliatille - very hearty , nice flavor . not as good as the spaghetti al limone
horrible service . . . . it took N mins to get our food on the table n a refill of water . . . no matter how the food tasted its terrible to dine here if u r hungry n its an awful place to celebrate ones anniversary . . . never ever coming here again even for free food ! ! ! 
came here with a friend while in the area with about an hour and a half to kill . the hostess ( wearing jeans ) was friendly and welcoming . as we sat down , our waitress had about N other tables get sat at the same time , so i was worried that our service would suffer . however , she did a great job being attentive to us . i love a good skirt steak and my friend and i each ordered it . it comes with sausage , peppers , and onions and it was excellent . i am pretty picky about my medium rare , and it was cooked perfectly . they give you a pretty large portion for the price , which i recall was around N . i don ' t find myself in the carlstadt area too much but i really enjoyed my meal here and if i am ever around the area again , i would definitely make it a point to return ! 
horrible experience all around . i can ' t decide which was worse the food , the drinks or the service . met a friend at the bar and as soon as i sat down , the bartender threw a menu at me and walked away . that dude set the tone for the evening . he begrudgingly dealt with us all night , snarling in our direction whenever we needed something . i made the mistake of ordering the red sangria . meh ! way too much orange and awfully sweet . you ' d do much better sticking with the wine list . for tapas we ordered the brussel sprouts , empanadas , steak tartare , bacon-wrapped figs and pork belly . the figs and empanadas came out two seconds after we ordered them and appeared to have been pre-cooked and sitting around all night . the brussel sprouts were decent , but can you really mess up brussel sprouts ? i enjoyed the steak tartare , but the pork belly was an overcooked mess . spongy , tough and just all-around nasty . so disappointing . to add insult to injury , when we asked for our check , the bartender ( that lovely fellow who threw the menus at us ) tossed it in our face and walked away . my advice , don ' t waste your money at this place . walk a little further west and enjoy an evening at tia pol instead . 
we were in the area , and looking for somewhere to eat . i remember cosmic cantina used to be in the spot i think . looked nice inside , and went inside to check it out . we went with two of their specials for the day , crab cake and lobster pad thai , and green curry fried rice . i haven ' t had much thai to have a basis of comparison , but i didn ' t find anything exciting . it was just ok . i finished the rest just didn ' t want it to be a waste . one thing to point out , the server mentioned the branzini dish ' s market price , but did not for the lobster pad thai . cost just as much . i ' ve eaten my share of lobster , and the claim was that it was a Nlb lobster . very small . my green curry fried rice was so so . came with three baby back ribs , two of which tasted like lamb to me . two of them the meat basically fell off . nice . the other , had to chew my way through to get the meat off . the rice was just so so . i think they used sticky rice , which makes sense , but just did not feel like it blended together well . well it did blend into what felt like just mush . i wish ngam the best , but i doubt i will ever be returning to this place . very high priced for what it is , and think can get a better deal going somewhere like pong sri . 
low-key and highly delicious ! i had brunch here on a drizzly saturday , and given the crowd milling about i was very skeptical of their estimated N-minute waitt -- and proven wrong . feels like they either had an " on " day or the surly staff that other yelpers had mentioned are gone . the people who seated and served us ( including cheryl ) were totally cheery , got my sally-complicated drink order right ( tea instead of coffee , and can i have the mimosa but with sparkling water not champagne ) , and very quick . they even handled a finicky girl at the next-door table with grace . she said , very bluntly " i don ' t like this . " server " ok , i ' ll take it . can we get you something else instead ? " the tea was delicious and served at a perfect temperature , potatoes were great with a spicy edge , pancakes were heavenly . a hearty , delicious brunch in a wonderfully sunny spot . 
i usually don ' t write negative reviews but i feel this one is needed . had to wait over N minutes for the food , was asked to move seats and they sat us right by the door . after my N minute wait for my food it honestly wasn ' t worth the wait . 
food and prices are good . but man , the space in there . . . i felt like tuna in a can . i don ' t know why people say romantic and intimate . the sitting arrangement is N the same , so pretty much the next person to your right and left is literally about N inches from you and half an inch space with the seat behind you . i could see the texts from the girl sitting next to me and my foot crossed the girl ' s ' date ' s foot . kinda weird , but whatever . we went a few weeks ago at Npm and it was hot as hell , so consider the heat and sweat . it ' s all fresh air . if the place is filled and the host tells ya there ' s a wait , you can go to the bar next door have a few drinks , cause she said she will come and get you . our wait was N mins i waited almost N , so then decided to wait outside and coincidentally the girl saw us come out and bam ! the table was open and ready . i was like . . . umm hmm . so it ' s up to you if ya wanna just wait outside and be in the girl ' s sight , or go have a few drinks . overall , i liked the bolognese with pasta and their tiramisu dessert was really good , plus their bread and olive oil . 
rays is the good ole reliable . massive pies . . . the best all-around pizza in the area and i make it a point to go to all pizzerias . 
i went to this place with my family . it ' s a great place to eat . just loved everything about this place
the place is smaller than other go go curry places . N tiny tables and about N chairs . but the curry was good . i got pork , and my friend got chicken . i may have stolen some of his food . . . haha no complaints about the food at all . i didn ' t really like the shrimp last time , but the pork and chicken were pretty good . the curry is on the sweeter side , so i guess people who prefer spicier curry won ' t like it much . 
the pizza is good , and we have previously had it delivered or picked it up . this evening , we ordered sandwiches and salad . the sandwich order was incorrect , and we were overcharged by more than N dollars . my husband had to sit on the phone with whomever was managing the place to total up the math , plus delivery charge and tax ( and they told us the delivery charge was taxed - is that even allowed ? ) , and only then did he agree to take the N . N back off our card . the online menu is outdated , as well , which they will admit to , so if you order online or by phone , make sure you know real prices . 
we always counted on perry street for excellent food , service and ambience . tonight , the food was very good . we invited a beloved friend to celebrate her victory over a severe moment in her life . we thought perry street , a restaurant across the street from our home , would be perfect . despite being refused a N N reservation but instead being given a N N seating in a near-empty restaurant , we sat for a good time . N people who were seated after us were given their cocktails sooner . i observed our drinks sitting on the side of the bar for ten minutes . finally a waiter served them after i requested he go to the bar and tote them the ten steps to our table . our guest ' s martini was poured and only N N of her glass was filled atop N N glassfull of ice . the other martinis were to the brim . ok , we will forgive . N we asked for more drinks . they were not brought . N minutes later , we asked again . one drink was brought , then we had to wait longer , and ask again for another empty drink to be refilled . ok , we ' re wondering what ' s happening , but will let that , as well as continued requests for water refills , pass . N the waiter took our dinner order , stating there was one special on the menu , nantucket scallops . we each ordered appetizers , and our guest ordered the scallops as her main course . unfortunately the waiter did not mention the scallops were an appetizer , and when the mains were served , she had a tiny olive dish-sized strip of scallops , no vegetables , presented to her unapologetically . we complained to the waiter who did not acknowledge . N we continued to request drinks and water by catching the waiter this practice is par for the course at other restaurants , but we never had to beg for service at perry street before . i mentioned to our waiter that this was the most inattentive wait experience we ' ve ever had at this restaurant . to his credit , he sent the manager over . N the manager apologized , and offered to comp us out first round of drinks and our desserts . we thanked him for the deference to our experience . when the bill arrived , our first round of drinks were comped , but we were charged for the desserts . N the waiter removed one of our dessert plates while two of us were still having dessert . when i said i didn ' t expect him to do that in the middle of dessert , he snapped , " i wasn ' t going to take yours . " N at the beginning of the meal i asked a waiter to check my golf umbrella . as we were leaving , the umbrella was missing , someone had stolen it . no apology . do think we should take any more special friends to perry street ? 
absolutely terrible . loud , cramped , poor service , food was sub par if you ignore the fact that my boyfriend and i both came down with food poisoning less than N hours after . i had a tuna special , the tuna was inedible so i ate the side asparagus and risotto . my boyfriend had the fish of the sea dish which no doubt lead to our illness , as we both at the shrimp from that dish and fell ill . my mother had the lasagna which was utterly unimpressive and the gravy if you call it that lacked flavor . my father did have a veal dish which he seemed to enjoy . the two men ordered espresso which had to be sent back as it was watered down coffee . all in all i will never be returning , N for a dinning experience that i will definitely not soon forget and wish i could . 
my friends and i came here for brunch . the food was just okay . we got the bottomless bellini for N , but it took forever for them to replace our next champagne bottle . may give this place another try because the bellini deal is a steal . 
what an amazing find ! highly recommended . to start we had the guac extra spicy . . . great kicks . then as my meal i had the special of the day . . . spaghetti with salmon in a light white sauce . super yummy ! and my fiancee had mac and cheese ( obvi because if there is mac and cheese on the menu anywhere he is going to get it ) . . . but to make it extra special he added both lobster and bacon . ultimately he said he could have done without the bacon and just did lobster but all in all very very yummy . the restaurant is super small so if you have a party of over N this probably isnt the place for you . many craft beers and great wine selections . great date night . 
i have been here twice don ' t think i will return although the staff was friendly , food not as cheap as promoted . pros friendly staff near times square fast seating . cons expensive and food was mediocre and too long to arrive . 
this is the furthest mexican food in the us , from mexico and make some of the best tacos . great little diner , good beer and great food . 
concerto fusion ' s location is a bit seedy . when you first pull up to the place , your first instinct is to turn around and leave . it ' s located in a very small strip mall and has a very faded , horrible looking sign . but once you walk through the doors , you ' re greeted by an indoor waterfall and a restaurant with a sleek , modern design . the sushi is excellent as is the service . in addition to the usual sushi options , they also feature some unique items such as a yellow tail guacamole roll - yellow tail and scallion , topped with guacamole , jalapeno tobiko and spicy tropical sauce . both times i have been , i have had the sushi . i am curious to go back and check out one of the many menu options . several people around us ordered entrees and they looked excellent . the full menu can be found on their website - concertofusion . com
summary not enough vegetables , vegetables are not fresh , food overall is too salty , too dry , our group of four threw out quite a bit of the food . it ' s cheap , but i can make better indian food ( at least to my tastes ) at home . the N reason i didn ' t enjoy the meal here was the vegetables--don ' t go here if you want a well-balanced meal with a lot of fresh vegetables . i really don ' t get all the favorable reviews . is this place getting their friends to post fake reviews , or do people just have different tastes from me and my friends ? did we get this place on an off day , or do people really not care about fresh vegetables ? actually , i think the real reason for all the stellar reviews is that people probably go here really late at night when they ' re really drunk . that doesn ' t help me because our group was totally sober and it was normal dinner time . still , if i were drunk and in this vicinity late at night , i ' d probably prefer tower style pizza around the corner . anyway . . . i ordered a kati filled with chicken and i finished mine . the bread was pleasantly moist , but the contents of it were dry and too salty . i liked the mint chutney on the wrap that was probably the best part of my meal , but it wasn ' t the freshest or best mint chutney i ' ve had . the other people ordered platters . there were very few vegetables in the platters . one came with a crappy tomato ( it ' s the heart of tomato season , why are they getting the disgusting low-quality tomatos that are provided by food service and fast food places ? in winter this is excusable but not this time of year ) and there was a little bit of iceberg lettuce ( ugh , why is anyone still using this ? ) in most of them . the biryani came with some overcooked broccoli and a few peas and carrots . the biryani , like most of the food here , was too dry , and a bit too salty for me , although not as much as my wrap . i also am not a huge fan of the ambiance . it is very clean , and there was a c which was nice because it was hot and humid outside , but overall it wasn ' t the most pleasant place . the music was a bit loud and sort of jarring , the sort of music i ' d prefer dancing to , rather than eating a meal to . maybe i just wasn ' t in the mood for it , but it sort of seemed to fit with the food--a bit in your face but not nuanced or balanced . two stars , not one , because i finished my food , and even though i didn ' t exactly feel great after eating the food here , i did not get sick . and at least it was cheap . if i want indian fast food , i would much prefer places like desi chaat house in west philly . . . it ' s cheap , faster than this place , and the meal comes with fresh fruits and vegetables and i find it leaves me feeling better . seriously though vegetables vegetables vegetables . it ' s part of a healthy diet , it makes the food taste better , and it ' s a necessary requirement to get me to come back after eating at a restaurant . 
it sucks ! the food and service are the worst . 
we ' ve eaten dinner here before after a night at art after N at the art museum . i had a strawberry chicken dish and kristine had the french toast ( breakfast can be gotten at anytime , btw ) . we liked it so much we wanted to get back sometime for breakfast . . . and this past weekend gave us that opportunity . we met our friends there , greg g and maria ( since it ' s right in greg ' s neighborhood ) . the wait wasn ' t that bad for Nam . we waited a little more than N mins . we all ordered breakfast specials . maria and i got a french toast with a peach and strawberry syrup . it was good . . . and portions were huge ! kristine got the pumpkin pancakes that she ' s been craving for weeks and enjoyed them very much ( however she would have liked a little more syrup on the underneath pancakes because they got a little dry ) . greg g got the eggs benedict and cleared the plate completely , so i assume he really liked it . needless to say we ' re going to be back at sabrina ' s many many times . it ' s great breakfast brunch food that makes you crave more . 
catering department is excellent . customer service always exceeds my expectations . i cater lunches often and i know woodbridge deli always delivers an excellent presentation and on time . i usually just order salads , sandwiches and fruits . nothing fancy but does the trick . a lot of places have decent food , but what i really love about woodbridge deli is their consistent quality and terrific costumer relations . 
too expensive for what you get . very tasty , but not worth it . 
had brunch here yesterday . the dining room is lovely , and it was half empty - which made the painfully slow service even more annoying . we were seated and given menus , and waited N minutes for someone to take out drinks order . the waiter also reminded us we needed to order bread and pastries - none were coming . note to danny meyer when i ' m paying N bucks for N people to have brunch , you could bring a basket of rolls . for free . eventually the drinks came . my friend asked for more ice for her iced tea . it didn ' t come until we ' d finished the appetizers and were getting the entrees . the food was good . not great . the tuna crudo was extremely salty , and the bun on the chicken burger was very dry - almost stale . the lobster pasta entree was a tiny portion , and the lobster was shredded . really ? frankly , am not sure it was really lobster . the desserts were good , though we went for simple . the sundae and some ice cream . if you have a lot of time , and don ' t mind crazy prices , this is place is for you . ( i expect ny prices , but the portions made for very poor value . ) 
clean , friendly , fast and very tasty . i can ' t say anything but superlatives about johnny ' s . we enjoyed our breakfast so much , and the perfectly made hot coffee was so good . the staff is very friendly . it is the coolest place to have breakfast or lunch in nyc . 
dinner was awesome tonight ! we got there a little early and had a drink at the bar , which was great and the bartender was really awesome . definitely try the ginger-tangerine margarita . our food was really good , great flavor and the entrees were the perfect portion . the only reason i ' m giving a N-star review is because of the service . our waiter was ok but kind of a dud . i asked for recommendations and what he personally liked and it was like he didn ' t really know the menu . other than that , all was great and would definitely go again . 
crispy green beans . at N one could expect that the tops are cut off and the most stringy parts are cleaned . very difficult to eat with utensils and too greasy for finger food . roasted cucumber gazpacho at N - someone went wild with the salt , did anybody taste this before sending it out ? duck - good sized portion , perfectly cooked with crispy and tasty skin . rescued the meal . 
overall the food is good not great . i had the chipotle black bean burger on flatbread . the patty was mushy but had a decent flavor . they forgot the avocado so i had to ask for it . to its credit , the overall ambiance is pleasant . in fact , diners have three to choose from the patio , the pub or the dining room . it ' s a great place to meet friends for an evening late night drink . there ' s usually an open table and occasionally a live band . 
so i admit , i didn ' t want to write a review for cafe lutecia because i wanted to keep it to myself and my neighbors . i mean , nothing ruins a lovely cafe like this more than not being able to get a table ! i come here for their croque-monsieur , their fresh salads , their sandwiches , their quiches , and definitely their lemonade . strong and not too sweet , their lemonade is perfect for lunch while watching the world go by . come early - sometimes they run out of a few menu items and they close by Npm on weekends . 
great go-to , fun friday nite place . i ' ve been coming here for over N years , probably once every other month and the food is always consistently yummy , hot and fresh . the waitstaff and hosts are always accommodating and squeeze us in whenever possible . being regulars definitely has it ' s perks . pad see-yu and pad thai are great and the calamari is crispy and delicious . great neighborhood spot , every time i ' m here i have a great experience . don ' t get mad at them when you have to wait they ' re obviously popular for a reason ! 
i travel back and forth a lot from nyc to phl for work and i was recommended pyt so i brought a co-worker out for dinner drinks after work . the piazza is very modern and impressive , and the atmosphere hipster brooklyn . i looked at the website and thought it could be a fun evening . when we got there we were seated quickly and the menu seemed very creative . we ordered some drinks and appetizers . unfortunately the appetizers were better than the meal itself . i ordered a burger and it was quite far from medium , it was very dry . my co-worker got a chicken sandwich which she said was very bland . she had asked for avocado but it never made it on the sandwich ( it was on our bill though ) . our table had no napkins , silverware , and our server completely forgot our second round of drinks . the service was spotty and slightly frustrating . 
i just had lunch here and everything was fantastic ! the staff were friendly , service was quick , everything was clean , and most importantly of all the food was delicious ! their miso soup was really great and all of the sushi rolls i ordered were very tasty . i think the spicy tuna roll was my favorite and i will definitely be coming here again the next time i ' m in the area . 
love gelone ' s . found this place several years ago and my friends and i make it a standing date to meet there twice a month . the food is generous and delicious . its a byob yet the prices are very reasonable . the staff couldn ' t be nicer . i especially love the string bean and potato appetizer its a cold salad dressed with a balsamic glaze . 
good food . spicy indeed . service was average . needs improvement . appetizer was badly presented . dosa was great . dessert was overly sweetened . i tried to dine there during the weekday and looks like they are closed . strange . 
sottocasa is a lovely restaurant , mostly because of the friendly , welcoming staff . seems like a family-owned place . the atmosphere is comfortable clean , and i ' ve never had to wait for a table . and the food here is good . you can tell the ingredients are fresh and high-quality . my only complaint , and this happened on both times i ' ve visited , is that the pizza is often undercooked ( crust dough isn ' t quite done enough ) and sometimes a little wet . like the innards of the fresh tomato topping have seeped out onto the pizza , or like the fresh mozzarella wasn ' t drained pressed enough . and i don ' t want to disparage too much because this does indicate quality freshness and the pizza always tastes great ( trust me , it ' s never stopped me from eating it ) , just the texture could use a little work in this area . maybe just give it a few more minutes in the oven ? press all wetness from ingredients before topping ? ? personally i do like my pizza to be crispy so maybe this is just a preference of mine , but if they nailed that then i ' d add this to my list of pizza faves along with lucali and roberta ' s ( aaand if they added liquor cocktails ) . but other pluses include a good wine list , and a lovely back garden ! 
i love the bar . its got a really cute theme , all the workers are dressed to match , and the people are pretty friendly . the bouncer was very nice and unpretentious and the bartenders were attentive and polite , what more could you ask for . the only bad thing i can point out is that this place gets really crowded . . . to the point where there is no where to move ! but really thats not the bar ' s fault . i think it means they are doing something right that makes people want to come here ! give the place a try ) 
once in a week i visit this place to have some breakfas
i have to give print . five stars . i came here on a first date and i ' m certain that the restaurant helped make the date a wonderful time . orlando provided amazing wine recommendations to pair with our dinner . we had enough items off the menu to be certain that all of the ingredients were of utmost quality and completely seasonal . my steak was perfectly cooked and for someone who normally complains about portioning i was quite happy . will return . 
be prepared to wait a very long time for this exquisite pizza . the word is that their sicilian ( square ) is the better of the two options , the crust is both crunchy and chewy , a perfect blend . i am from massachusetts and visited there with my brother in law , wife ( both from ny ) and our infant daughter . luckily , she is well behaved because we waited almost N hours for N sicilian pies . i have never felt unsafe in ny but as we walked out of difara ' s to our car , not far away , i truly felt that i might be knocked over the head with a blunt object . they would have left my wallet and watch but snatched up the N pies . i would think twice about going again , at least with kids in tow , but i will always savor the experience and flavor of the " best sicilian pizza " in nyc . 
since i never have cash on me , i can only do N stars for cash only . but . . . pizza is so good that i keep getting cash out just for this pie . the crust , omg the crust . flaky , smokey from the oven . not too much sauce on the pizza . just right
the best fajitas i ever had i wish they could make it for me in my house whenever i want ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! lol i usually am the type to order extra cheesy foods in mexican food places since i love cheese , but after being prodded into eating jose tejas fajitas more than once i ' ve somehow managed to fall in love with the serving of seasoned onions in this dish most of all . i order it with a side of vegetables which adds a freshness that compliments the seasoning of the onions and allows me the eating endurance it takes to completely obliterate the contents of my plate . i leave this restaurant fully satisfied for an awesome price and that is all i can say . there fajitas have made me go from being " meh " about onions to " yummmm " . the wait is usually N hr or less depending on what time you get there but i have no problem waiting . ive never had a problem with service but tbh it doesnt really matter to me since i am only there for the food . 
i come here a few times already first time was with my bf we wanted to try it everyone said the oysters was really good and we love oysters so we had too tried it , it was good and fresh the wait usually is really long and cant even make reservation but its worth the wait . food i recommend lobster mac cheese oysters tuna tartar lobster crabs they have a special that runs everyday i believe is N oysters everything was very affordable and not pricey a glass of wine was like N bucks . 
fish was the perfect place at which to spoil my long time bestie who ' s been spoiling me since day one . sure , it was a bit pricey , but that ' s only ' cause we balled out on a dozen oysters , bottle of prosecco , lobster roll , tuna burger and of course a fine dessert . and it was all worth it ! after all , it ' s not every day your best friend turns N . ha . the oysters were scrumptious , fresh , chilled , and rather deep , which i was impressed with . there ' s really nothing worse than paying N . N for a skimpy lukewarm oyster , but these were just the opposite . the entrees were delish too . the lobster roll wasn ' t phenomenal , but it didn ' t disappoint . ' twas flavorful and decently sized , though i do like my roll a tad more toasted in buttery goodness . all that really matters is the birthday girl enjoyed her tuna burg . we left feeling full ( but not too full , which is uber important ) , and with a strong buzz from the yummy prosecco . the atmosphere was perfect for what we were looking for a small yet lively spot where you ' re seated in close proximity to neighboring diners , yet no one can hear your conversation . our waitress was super pleasant and helpful as well , which is always a huge plus . we were originally gonna indulge in the awesome special ( N cherrystones or oysters and a glass of red or white wine , or pbr for N total ? yesplease ) . however , since this was a special occasion , we wanted to class it up with some sparklies . next time i ' m in town and craving some ' stones and a glass of house vino , liz and i will surely revisit fish for an affordable pregame treat . 
i like this place . it ' s often crowded , but if you don ' t mind eating a bit later ( after N N or so ) , you can usually walk in and get a table pretty quickly on weekends . the pork buns are one of my favorites as well as the spicy pork with rice cakes . some of the other items are a bit lacking in my opinion . last time i ordered the corned beef , which reminded me of a slice of spam . the quail was ok , but i ' m not a big fan of game birds anyhow . portions are small , but if you build your meal around the pork buns and spicy pork dish , you ' ll get plenty of food for your money . all around , a good place to eat with cool staff . 
i need to say how much i dislike this place . it probably doesn ' t have much to do with the place itself , it just seems to sour my mood . also , my friends love it and tease me for not liking it . take note the nastiness that must be living in those damned cheese puffs . . . 
i ' m not an expert in comfort food but this was absolutely amazing . i would definitely go back but make no plans afterwards because you are going to need a nap . the chicken with eggos was excellent and the bread pudding was worth the absolute immobility i had afterwards . can ' t wait to go back and try everything else on the menu . 
completely overrated
too lazy to cook breakfast , brunch , or linner ? nestled underneath a retiree condo tower is little pete ' s ! this isn ' t the one in rittenhouse , this is the original ( pictures of sylvester stallone and rizzo are on the wall ) . it ' s not a sabrina ' s or honey ' s , but you always know that the food is a little better than average . the proportions here are decent sized and will leave no stomach feeling deprived . go with the safe bet and get any of their omelets . it comes with the standard home fries and toast . they also got some kickass daily specials . eg . for N dollars , you can get a wok sized bowl of angel hair with chicken and cheesy tomato sauce , soup du jour , and salad . it also comes with dessert . get the chocolate pudding or jello with whipped cream . about N or so items are on the daily special menu that vary wildly for anywhere between N-N dollars . if you and your boo are on a diet , you can get the special and they add a N dollar sharing fee . not bad if you like to eat for cheap . also , their outside seating is especially awesome when the weather is nice . 
best cheese steak , ever ! 
i always considered barrio chino to be a great place for food and margaritas . habenero grapefruit is amazing . however , i am a little skeptical of their cleanliness after my last visit ( which coincidentally will be my last time ever ) . truthfully , i ' ve always used yelp to check out reviews , but have never posted a review this experience was so awful i feel the need to . my friends and i arrived and had about an hour wait before we were seated on a saturday ( which is pretty typical ) . i ordered the habenero grapefruit margarita ( like i usually do ) -- we all ordered a mix of tacos to share . after eating the tacos and finishing the meal we asked for the check and paid out . as we were leaving i noticed i still had a little margarita left . i proceeded to take the finishing sip and looked down in the glass only to see a gigantic clump of what i suspect was human hair . when i realized i had been drinking a concoction of habenero , grapefruit and human hair i panicked and ran out of the place thinking i was going to puke . i have no idea what the hell happened , but will never go back in order to find out . if i could , i would give barrio chino negative stars ! 
this place by far is one of my favorite restaurants not only because my current boyfriend and i had our first date here but because i been going here for over N years and this place is still on my top N restaurants in brooklyn ! ! ! anything you order is good arepa de pabellon is the best ! ! 
finally got to try this famous thai ressie ! suppose to be the best in nyc and yes it is ! came in on saturday night for dinner of N . the wait was about N mins but was def worth the wait ! we ordered their papaya salad ( original ) , some flat noodle dish , and a fried fish with curry paste ! sooooo good ! ! ! i wish i had room for more . there were so much to order on the menu but we couldn ' t get more ( the papaya salad was good and not super spicy which i like . fish was beyond outstanding . sweet and sour and spicy ! heavy flavor just the way i like it . oh and did i mention it ' s fried . . dipped in heavy sauce with curry paste and a bunch of herbs and spices ( not sure what they are ) but u really need to try it . nothing like you have tasted anywhere else the noodle dish was okay . quite blend but i think cus we ordered the wrong one . go with their famous ones . ask for recommendations . but then again everything else was super flavory so this works out evenly . then the papaya salad is obliviously just as good ! ! def come and try ! ! we have yet to try many other things ! ! dessert menus has a lot of varieties too ! 
foods are decent . only the reason why i giving N star instead of N star manager or owner ( ? ) he was plain rude . i asked for a baby high chair and then with an attitude he said " ? ? ? ? i ' ll show you " i didn ' t understand what he said exactly . in a while , another staff brought it with a kindness . lastly , i walked to the counter for a pay , he was giving me an another attitude i said " give me N back please " , he goes count the monies takes a while . i asked one more time " just give me N back " he said " i know ! , i have ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? tip " i thought he was trying to say " i know , but i have to calculate money for the tip first ! " . ok i understood , but he shouldn ' t said like that . he could be nicer than what he did . he also never said like " thank you " or " how was it ? . . . " no even eye contact ' . it ' s obviously shame on joya if he is the owner of this restaurant . overall , good foods , good atmosphere , good server , good location , reasonable price , only the manager or owner . 
my friends threw me a birthday dinner here this week ( on a snowy wednesday ) and while i have been a miyas fan for a while now they really impressed me this time . with thirteen diners its a little cumbersome to get everyone to decide what they want and then remember what they ordered etc . our waitress suggested that we tell her how much we wanted to spend ( N ) and any dietary restrictions and she would just bring us whatever the chef felt inspired to send out . it was spectacular , not only was the food amazing ( as usual ) but we had the opportunity to try all sorts of things that we probably wouldn ' t have chosen off the menu ( seriously , how to you ever make a decision at miyas ? ! everything is amazing and the menu is intimidatingly huge ! ) , the staff was delightful and super cute ! they were great about having N nursing students and sos sitting around and being loud for a couple of hours and were sweet enough to sing me ' happy birthday ' as they brought out the cake ( which we brought with us ) . amazing ! i ' m thrilled with miyas ! and you should be too ! 
wow ! there is nothing like the combination of great food and service . i love when a server can balance professionalism and humor . i went back to my home town to visit four buddies , one has been a chef for years and wanted to come here , so glad we did . we were a handful but the waitress did a great job keeping us in line . i feel her wine suggestions made the meal . 
fresh , wood-fired pizza , yes please . some of the best pizza and gourmet flavor combos i ' ve ever had , easily top N i ' ve had in the city . the crust is amazing . so , i ' m definitely one to use red chili pepper flakes , but seriously , you don ' t need any form of condiments to go with this pizza . the pizza here is so thoughtfully handcrafted and tasty , it is perfect as is . they have a nice wine selection too . a bit crowded , and the tables are very close together , you can barely move around the table next to you without feeling like your ass is in their faces , but honestly , i crave this place , their pizza is fantastic , so that is the least of my concerns . 
blech on the cheese whiz ( tastes a whole lot more like whiz than cheese ) and blech on the lousy attitude . not welcoming at all . 
worth waiting for . 
honestly , i have been going here for years , but lately on weekend nights ( when it is really busy ) the staff has been unbearably rude . it ' s as if we are all so lucky to even be eating there we should tolerate the mood swings of the staff . i mean the food is good , but it doesn ' t deserve a cult like status . i tried last night to get a table , was given a N minute wait time , then the hostess added N minutes on , which then became N and by N N we left . after i expressed a little frustration with the inaccurate wait time , she told me that " there were still people in front of you " as if i don ' t know how a list works at a restaurant . when i told her might be better to give people a more accurate time so they could go have a drink and plan better her response was " thanks for the tip . " it just seems completely odd to me that even if a restaurant is busy and popular being rude would be an acceptable business practice . i am not expecting sunshine on a slammed , saturday night , but really ? the last straw was when the barista bumped into me and then groaned . he was also overheard insulting any number of clients . 
i have never gone wrong with the market plate here and am grateful for their consistent and wide variety of fresh veggie options . it frankly amazes me that no other eatery in the area ( let alone nyc ) has come up with the idea of always offering approximately N different fresh veggie options . nyer ' s love their veggies and so everyone in the resto business should take a lesson from this . 
brooklynesque hipster joint in astoria ! good brunch burger , good bloody maries ! i ' d def go back . 
bottom line the steak sandwiches are pretty good . i had a cheese steak with fried onions and a cheese steak with fried onions and pepperoni ( a little light on the pepperoni ) served on a nice roll . this is a nice little find if you are from a real philly cheese steak area and find yourself in central nj . 
if i miss my once a week visit for my chicken soft tacos i get very sad . . . . the hot salsa is the best i have ever had . . . 
i had a horrible experience here . the guy taking my order said he didn ' t know how to make a reuben which is on the menu . he then wandered away and left me standing there on my cane . he came back and told us again he couldn ' t make the reuben meanwhile another guy came over . i got tied up with this utter nonsense . i will never come here again . my whole family was with me to witness this debacle . poorest service i have ever seen . and no apologies either . 
we travel from the mainland to philadelphia , shopping in chinatown to find this hotel , we had lunch here . our party of seven people spent a total of N , N rmb per person , is still very cost-effective . the key is where the flavor is very good , basically kept the domestic sichuan taste . the boss is also good , and finally gave us fruit . i feel very good ! so come specially written praise . 
think mc ' donalds and you won ' t be disappointed . maybe . stay away from the ' haddock ' ( not ) sandwich or the ' onion rings ' ( minced dried breaded mush ) . can ' t screw up fries right ? 
stopped in on N N to try the burgers with N of my business buddies as i had seen a review in a local restaurant blog earlier that day . the review was spot on . we ordered the bacon jam burger , montclair blue cheese and bacon cheeseburger . all were freshly prepared and served with fries . i suggest you kick it up and go for an order of the bacon jam fries as they are outstanding ! while dining we had the opportunity to chat with the owners for a while . some really great people with a passion for creating and serving delicious " stuffed " burgers ! 
yesterday was the Nth anniversary and all the medium sized curries were only N ! after a few drinks on an empty stomach , curry sounded really good ! a friend and i decided to hit this place up cause of the special . i got the breaded pork curry with cheese . it was my first time going here and it won ' t be the last . the curry hit the spot just right . the portions are really good and will fill you up right . i do suggest getting cheese on your curry . the saltiness of the cheese goes well with the curry . it was a good call ! this place is another hidden gem in the city . the place is a bit small so you may have to get yours to go and eat it somewhere else . the place is pretty decent and the staff is great ! 
the surrounding neighborhood is a beautiful and quiet escape from downtown new haven . the brunch selection is vast and so are the rotating lists of specials . food was delicious . i would recommend this as one of my favorite brunch places in the area to anyone . 
best pizza on earth . i ' ve lived in vt , ma , fl , and ny and i can not find pizza as tasty , cheap and consistent as it is here . anytime i ' m in vermont , this place is on the top of my list for places to stop and eat . try it , and you will forever crave it ! oh , and the dining room is exactly the same as it was when i was growing up in the N ' s . same plants , bench seats , walls and possibly video games ! yeah , it could use an update- but who cares ! the pizza is amazing ! 
bland , i dont think you need much else , priced fine
i came here with a few friends for the first time and the atmosphere is relaxed , you can sit by the fireplace , the sushi is top notch , and the waitress gave great input on everything . overall awesome place and we will definitely be back . 
fantastic little restaurant ! if you want to try a great breakfast while walking around philly that ' s a N minute walk to the historical sites , choose this one ! my friends and i wanted to get a quick breakfast while in the city and yelp had this at N . N stars-- was not disappointed . i had the pick your own brunch , chose the eggs over easy with cheddar and goat cheese on top of bacon and ham . my gf had the eggs benedict over homemade cornbread . . amazing ! things to definitely get -- chocolate chip scones ! ! best scones i ' ve ever had ! ! things to watch out for-- small space , so get a reserved table ! will definitely try this place again . 
one of my all time favorite restaurants in the city ! the menu is perfectly simple and the food is always fresh and delicious . i brought my family once and when my clumsy N year old brother broke a plate the staff smiled and weren ' t upset in the slightest . the chef is super nice and really cares about what he is doing . i can ' t wait to go back ! 
the food and service here is unbelievable ! great environment . repeat visitor
try the seasonal soba ( or soba of the day ) . what a beautiful experience ! the lunch box is kind of a great deal , you will be satisfied after finishing that meal ! 
came across this place during balthazar day , where they give out one free balthazar , and ended up buying a small box to bring up . yeah , that ' s how good it was . i had the apricot , green tea ( matcha ) , raspberry and a few others whose name currently escapes me . all i really remember , is gobbling it all down . hard to savor something that tastes that good . 
really rally good falafel . and i ' m not even that into falafel . i just wish the truck came around more often by my job . 
excellent banh-mi ! some of the best i ' ve had in nyc . a bang for your buck stop , as the classic sandwich is only N . definitely worth a visit ! 
i am particular about my mexican food , especially having lived in a mexican neighborhood in chicago with a taqueria on every corner . i wasn ' t that impressed . 
four of us went to dinner this past saturday night . . the food was good , ( a little expensive for the amount of vegetables you get as a side dish should be part of the meal . ) our server was informative . but it lacked the good family feeling we use to get when tom and rosanna had their restaurant in there . in the time we were there , we saw mr scarpone come out and talk to one table . plus it is very loud , hard to have a conversation . maybe , he should try to hang material from the ceiling . the jenkintown train station had a restaurant in it and it helped buffer the noise . i wish mr . scarpone luck . 
yay - a winner winner pizza dinner for nolita - here ' s why wine - we had a wonderful red . pizza - we had the special and it was perfect . broccoli , chunks o ' garlic , tomato , mushroom , and sopressatta made this the perfect dinner treat . the flavor was impeccable . the crust was crispy and light . they skip the sauce on this one - but who needs it ? N N delectable . we shared a savory salad of roasted beets and goat cheese . that , too , was knock-your-socks-off good . service was pretty good , not in your face at all . the hostess sat us immediately and our waitress was very amicable . oh , and before i forget to mention it - this place is huge compared to what you see from the storefront . there are , i believe , three separate dining sections beyond the front bar area . still - make a reservation . . . once word is out , i ' m sure this will be packed nightly ! did i mention it was on a wednesday ? ? ? go now ! 
this place is a very cute , cozy spot . i grabbed a drink and some tapas with a girlfriend here . we got a pitcher of white pomegranate berries sangria ( deceivingly strong . . it tastes so sweet and yummy that you forget and suddenly you ' re buzzin hardcore . . . . or perhaps that ' s my terrible tolerance of any alcohol whatsoever ) . fresh blackberries at the bottom of the sangria . . yum ! it was around N pitcher or N-N a glass . we shared N selection of tapas . calamari ( so good and a generous helping at that , served with some marinara and lemon wedge ) , mussels ( again , pretty generous for a tapas spot and very well flavored ) , and small meatballs ( this came with N tiny meatballs , with some sauce squirted on top ) . i would definitely go back and order the calamari and mussels again but i would not order the meatballs ( not too flavourful and just not memorable in my book . . booo . . . ) all N tapas ranged between N- N each . this is a super cute date spot or a good place to grab a drink with a friend- could go both ways . one thing to note-- they won ' t seat you unless your entire party is there . when i walked in , there were N empty tables but they still wouldn ' t seat me til my friend arrived . i would definitely return to this spot ) . 
first off , i love byobs ! i wish we had more of these in dc . secondly , the prices are really reasonable for great food and service . the ingredients are so fresh ! they don ' t take reservations on weekends , but we were prepared for that with backup reservations at another restaurant . we arrived at N p . m . and the wait was N minutes , which wasn ' t too bad . we were seated in the middle of the restaurant against a wall near the window . it was loud , especially because of a table of annoying jersey shore type women who felt like they had talk as loudly as possible so that everyone at the restaurant could hear them . the food made up for the boisterous table , however . we started out with the bosc pear and gorgonzola flatbread . it was warm and cheesy goodness that went wonderfully with the oregon cabernet sauvignon we brought . we had the grilled octopus salad with feta , which was good , but i ' d probably not order it again . the octopus was tender and tasty , but the feta and salad dressing overpowered the octopus . we also had the feta and garlic crusted baby rack of lamb w fresh mint and dill labne . i never would have imagined breading lamb , but it was surprisingly good . the lamb was tender and perfectly cooked at medium rare . the mint and dill labne was thick , like it was made with greek yogurt and the mashed potatoes were to die for . the asparagus added a nice color the dish . i can see why this dish is among the most popular dinner entrees here . if i were to start a restaurant , it would be similar to audrey claire . fresh , simple , and delicious . 
i love this place ! my husband and i went there for our anniversary dinner because N ) we love sushi N ) we had a groupon for N worth of food for N N ) it ' s a byo ! the food was great , we both had sushi dinners with miso soup for me and salad for my husband . we added on a specialty roll . the service was also really good and the best part was that the owner , hendra , introduced himself and checked in on us . we enjoyed talking with him as much as the rest of the dining experience . our bill was a ridiculous N . N and we were satiated . we are definitely coming back with friends . 
i was indecisive as to post my review to pat ' s or geno ' s , but since we did encounter pat ' s first , pat ' s will have to deal with this review , but please read in its entirety , because geno ' s didn ' t score big either . enjoying a philly cheese steak was to be one of the highlights for my husband during our vacation , so of course we had to try pat ' s and geno ' s , which we decided to eat at both locations on the same day . that was a smart decision , because after experiencing pat ' s , i would have refused to spend money on transportation to go back and even try geno ' s . with all the notoriety , you would think between the two locations one could make a philly cheese steak that we could boast about when we returned home ! pat ' s sandwich ( grilled onions and provolone ) was not heated at all , the roll was extremely hard , and the meat had so much fat that after N bites , i couldn ' t handle the experience any longer . even my husband gave up trying to eat it . however , i decided not to waste all my money , so i proceeded to feed the roll to the N pigeons that surrounded us while we tried to eat . still adventurous or dumb we proceeded across the street to geno ' s . the best part of the meal was there were less pigeons ! however , the philly cheese steak ( grilled onions and cheese whiz ) was nothing to praise either . the meat and roll were easier to chew digest than pat ' s , but the overall flavor was lacking ! basically , more money down the drain . i also didn ' t understand at both locations , why they rush you to order the sandwich and then direct you to another window to wait in line to order fries drinks while the sandwich gets colder ! my advice to anyone wanting to try a cheesesteak at either location is to bring your own homemade steak-um sandwich and pay the N for the roll to feed the pigeons ! 
if i could leave zero stars , i would . this place has a great atmosphere , and what appeared to be great food . . . if the idiot manager could stop seating his friends before the rest of the hour wait . we waited and were told we were the next two top , but the manager continued to let in plenty of two tops before us . the two girls managing the wait list were very professional and tried to keep track of what this idiot kept doing to their organized process . one waiting patron , questioned his practices and he yelled at her " this is my restaurant , don ' t tell me what to do ! " . . . she was about as meek and polite as it gets . the waiting area is a clusterf ck to begin with , before the idiot owner decides to start screwing with the wait list . i have never seen such horrible customer service in my life . needless to say , we left before we were seated . i was very disappointed . they have plenty of tables , and with the right management this place could be great . again , zero stars if possible . i ' m surprised this place stays in business . 
this is the best southindian restaurant around nj . try the crab masala very nice and spicy one . . . my wife loves the mutton sukka varuval . . . . . . . . . . . 
they never cease to amaze me . i have tried the majority of every seasonal menu they offer , and i can ' t stop going back for more . the shortrib ragu is to die for , as are any of the risotto dishes . if you don ' t like garlic , however , you may not like mercato ! the service is always great . byob keeps cost from being outrageous , and allows for bigger orders ! worth the ( often long ) wait . 
this is a cute and intimate japanese restaurant with friendly staff that i stumbled upon thanks to the yelp app . i tried their spicy yellow tail with scallion roll , the toro roll and the spicy salmon roll which were all pretty decent . the miso soup was a little too salty . i also tried their assorted sashimi which was pretty good . their food seemed pretty fresh . for dessert , i had their green tea ice cream which was pretty phenomenal . you can tell that it ' s pretty good quality . 
hands down the best italian good hid in central nj . the meatballs are out of this world ! ! 
when a menu shows N tacos for N . N you know its theme based food trap ! the food doesn ' t hold up . ordered a burrito ' aye carruba ' when it arrived it was extra piping hot . so hot that the cheese on top the roll was melted down to just a yellow color burnt on top of the rolled flour . the meat of the burrito had a ' burned ' taste and unfortunately it tasted like canned meat . the inside of the burrito was just a huge blob mess of all the ingredients but no defining taste . just not tasty at all . i was excited to try this place but the food is not good . my friends plate was bad too . ' authentic ' mexican is not accurate , that ' s just a typical sales motto . real authentic is taqueria style places - better food for cheaper prices . i won ' t return . 
everything was cooked to perfection . the service was excellent and the ambiance was lovely . our waiter vinny was great ! 
a great addition to fairmount . food is delicious , coffee is some of the best i ' ve had around here and the staff is super friendly . they work quickly and efficiently to get your food prepared , but not too quickly that it feels like a typical deli . it ' s still got the gourmet cafe feel to it . i highly recommend the brownies , cookies and cakes too - delicious and fresh . all in all , a very welcome addition to the neighborhood . 
great spot , try something new , drink some great rum . huge rum list ! i always eat way too much here . two arepas were enough . why order a third ? the interior is nice , " favela style " and its great for a few friends small group and drinks ! service is okay , no complaints . and the sauces on the table , oh my god . please try not to steal it ! 
great place to come to . so excited it ' s close to home . food was really good , super friendly service and attentive . i think this place will grow fast . 
one of the best dining experiences in les . great atmosphere , creative menu , simple but delicious food and the most genuinely hospitable staff i have ever encountered in ny . i would go back to this place a thousand times over . 
what a burger . i wouldn ' t consider myself a burger guy , but their guacamole bacon cheddar burger is amazing . i ' ve ordered it about N times , and all but N ( they burnt it ) was amazing . i have also had their pulled pork omelet , also amazing . the service sucks every time i ' ve been there , and the wait times are somewhat ridiculous . but , what a burger . so good its worth N stars . 
friendly and solid tex mex . chips are sometimes stale-ish but the salsa duo is surprisingly tasty . menu is very ambitious but never quite seems to hit a homerun . bonitas snacks are the way to go . little plates , baby , little plates . that ' s the way . look for seasoned corn-on-the-stick coming soon . tasty . pork skewers were perfect . veggie quesadilla mushroom heavy and perfect amount of cheese . little plantain fritters are a must and the steak burrito is as big as a N-year-old ' s head . nachos are good but it seems to depend on who ' s working as to how good . very loud . hipster heavy . friendly staff . popular outside seating . local ! 
the entire time i was thinking , wow i ' m a hypocrite , i don ' t eat my mom ' s pig feet but here , i ' m dogging everything down . d N prix fixe yellowtail sashimi , pork salad on mesclun greens , grilled pig feet knuckles , fried chicken , shabu shabu ( dumplings , bacon , more pig feet and knuckles , chives , cabbage , tofu ) , bibimbap rice egg , strawberry ice cream , mochi ( whoa ) , tea . . . . add a N sake . . . . i dreamt happy dreams that night . 
of all the restaurants i gone to i think i been here the most . yes , its touristy but who cares , the food here is so darn good . i usually come here for congee and flat noodles and both are among the best in chinatown . 
been her during summer of N ' , best dang pizza ive never had
this was a doomed location until sushi koshi arrived . the staff and chefs are terrifically welcoming and pleasant . while that is a great bonus it is the fresh food , artful preparation , and good prices that have us coming back again and again . just got back from vancouver and thought i ate the best sashimi of my life with some white tuna . walked into sushi koshi and got the same feeling . 
parc is one of my favorite ( albeit expensive ) restaurants in the city . whether eating or stopping in for a few drinks , this place has awesome ambiance incredible food . 
i got a large order of grits . i asked for a soft egg . then a pork belly . then some pesto . it was good . but a large all those toppings definitely made the grits very heavy and made me a bit nauseated . . . will ask for a small if in the mood for grits again . 
pretty much the best brunch i ' ve ever had in my life . a must-try breakfast brunch spot in manhattan . the menu has about a dozen items , not too many but they are all delicious ! my friends and i split N plates , we could not pick one haha . we had the baked eggs , banana nut pancakes , texas french toast , and the eggs benedict . the pancakes were amazing . without a doubt , i can say these are the best pancakes i have ever had in my life ! the baked eggs were also really delicious . the tomato sauce went so well with the eggs . the french toast was decadent , thick , and fluffy , and paired with fresh fruit , cinnamon , and their homemade whipped cream ( soooooo good ) . i am drooling just writing about this . the eggs benedict were good but did not compared to the deliciousness of the pancakes , french toast , and baked eggs . there is a long wait for brunch , make a reservation , and expect to wait some more , but it ' s definitely worth the wait ! i will fo sho be back here when i come back to ny . nomnomnom . N for N mimosas to complete your brunch experience ! 
this place has now become special to me . i orginally came here nervous as hell on my Nnd date with my now boyfriend and thought it was so awesome he ordered my whole dinner in portuguese . now that i have been back multiple times since i feel likei can accurately review . beyond marking the start of my love affair this place is amazng and as authentic as they come . there is something a touch hole in the wall but more homey than anything about the vibe . cannot speak to the buffet as i have only had the rice beans but the meat on spits bbq area in the back is not to be missed . seriously delicious types of meat and you really just have to tell the guy how much of each you want . the meat area has converted me to chicken heart ( it ' s good i promise ) . and if this place couldn ' t get any better they have guarana ( delicious soda ) , and brigadeiros and a ton other desserts . it ' s truly a slice of brazil in astoria . run , don ' t walk via the r train and thank me later . 
banana cookie is delicious . smoked salmon sandwich is really good . tandoori chicken sandwich . . . can ' t really taste the tandoori . it ' s more like plain grilled chicken with mint chutney on it . 
i ' ll start this review by saying that i absolutely love arepas . if you have never tried them , you need to . my usual arepas place is " valencia , " in norwalk , ct ( featured on diners , drive-ins , and dives ) . arepas cafe beat ' s the pants off valencia in almost every way . the arepas here are much larger and come in greater variety . i ' d recommend the mami to just about anyone . they are all priced around N . N- N . N and one arepa appetizer should be filling enough for anyone . the staff and owner are very friendly a serve up sizable and tasty sangria pitchers along with a host of other non-alcoholic venezuelan beverages . this is a wonderful astoria gem that is worth a try for anyone who enjoys delicious food at affordable prices . 
if i could personally drag everyone in new york city to this amazing restaurant , i would . sadly , i can ' t . so you should take my word when i say this is the best polish food i ' ve ever had . also , very cheap ! it ' s quite a find . i want to describe my favorite dishes , but the list would go on forever . you can ' t order something here and be disappointed . i promise . food aside , i also have to plug the owner , who is so nice and wonderful and who found my iphone in the park and returned it to me . so please go and support them . i want to keep them up and running ! 
stash ' s played a big role in my life . went to junior high a few blocks away , and maybe it was walking passed the soprano ' s film shoots on the way , but stash ' s seemed like a magical place where you wanted to belong . my best friend jake and i would regularly go with the hope that stash would remember our orders . i was a ham , american cheese , lettuce , and mayo guy . you ' d grab a clinton ice tea and sit at the table under a decades old poster of tony meola , signed i think . if kearny has a culture , stash ' s is where you can find it . 
great little bar that pops out of nowhere in crown height ' s bedford ave . can ' t speak to the food , but went instead for drinks at a bday gathering instead of dinner and got there a little past nine . it was packed with parties noshing away on what seemed like delish plates of food . nice large bar area with attentive bartenders . nice selection of beers on draft as well as wine on draft ! woo ! dark , low lighting adds to the atmosphere . definitely more restaurant than bar , but if you get the back space area , a small group should be fine . looks like they have a pretty outdoors area too , but we weren ' t allowed to venture out . two cons is that it can get very very hot in heeeerrrrre ( dress accordingly ) and the food odors ( which aren ' t bad ) permeate the place . so be forewarned . will be back to sample the nosh ! 
best meal i had in a while . food was amazing . the octopus and mussels were a great start . the sauces of both were to die for . used up the bread to soak all up all the left over sauce . filet mignon topped with foie gras was melt in your mouth good . byob was a great option . brought a bottle of red with me . will be coming back really soon . small place but worth it . 
needing to carbo-load ( wanting to , really ) before the nyc marathon , i was taken to this great little restaurant . we got the square pizza , a caesar salad and stuffed shells . all were hot ( excluding the salad , of course ) , fresh and tasty . i would go there again . the place has an intimate vibe . great for a date or a small group . 
i love this place , although the menu has been updated and the prices have gone up ( sangria was N at my last visit ) . the atmosphere is lively . the tapas are very solid , with good ceviche . 
food here is so amazing . . . i would love to go once again with my family . my dad loved the chicken dish . . . N stars . . 
this malaysian name-saked restaurant is more of a southeast asian delight ( with some chinese-ish options ) . penang is a great choice for food in china town and at very affordable prices ! in addition to more traditional malaysian foods of nasi lemak or roti canai , they also offer thai and chinese dishes . friends got the satay skewers and pad thai , which looked decent . i went for two orders of the roti canai ( appetizer ) . just how i remember it tasting from my time in se asia ! the curry dip was great as well . my only complaint is that it was a bit too oily . while i enjoyed the food there , there was nothing special . i ' m sure i will be going back for the reasonable prices . 
awesome place ! once you walk in , you notice all the seafood they have . smells good too . fresh and clean . kinda small place . when it gets packed , it gets really tight . there was only N waiter there and every time someone came in , he had to pull the table out so they can sit on the inside . food was really , really good . i got the lobster roll with old bay fries and gf got linguini with clams and cockles . lobster roll was excellent , reminded me of red ' s eats in maine . not exactly like it , but very close . better than luke ' s lobster that ' s for sure . we also had the calamari and ne clam chowder . both were really good , but the calamari was one of the best calamari i ' ve ever had . it was just so fresh and crispy . overall , this place is excellent . oh , and service was also good . 
basso N serves the best homemade pasta , in a relaxed environment , on the west side between Nnd and Nst street . their pastas are always perfectly cooked , and their sauces divinely buttery . lately , i ' ve chosen to sit at their cozy bar for dinner -- too eager to carb-load before a long run to wait fifteen minutes for a table . however , even on a weekend , you probably won ' t need to wait more than that for a table of two . if you ' re hungry , make a reservation . my go-to dishes are the grilled shrimp with cannellini beans for an appetizer and the papardelle with shrimp and asparagus or fettuccine with porcini mushrooms and spinach for a main course . just thinking about them make makes me hungry for another bowl . for dessert , a must-have is their ricotta cheesecake , which is nearly always a special . its surprisingly light and citrus-y for a cheesecake . but juniors , an outpost of which is found down the block , it is not . 
the price would have been right if the food had been paletable . the sushi was lukewarm , made from the cheapest of ingredients , and was nearly tasteless . the fried chicken was terribly greasy and tasted like the oil it was fried in was from last year . i was with a group , otherwise i would have just left . as it was , i filled up on the pasty that they bought from a commercial bakery . just terrible . 
this is the best chinese food i ever had ! everything was fresh and delicious ! the service was wonderful ! i also enjoyed their mango smoothie ! ! definately a N star experience ! ! 
had the N wrap combo grilled chicken mozzarella w tomato basil sauce . wrap was not terribly substantial , and the wrap itself was dry . the tomato basil sauce was white with flecks of tomato basil . the wrap contained fresh greens , but wasn ' t exactly teeming with either chicken or mozzarella . the fries were good , and come with your choice of dipping sauces . if they upped the quality of the wraps , the lunch combo wrap regular fries fountain soda would be a decent deal at around N . N . in conclusion , the fries are good , the wraps at least mine are mediocre . your mileage may vary . 
great place to shop and eat at any time . 
i read press about the brooklyn ice house to red hook and they kept referring to the owner coming from the gingerman . i went to college in austin where the gingerman is at it ' s best . in nyc , the gingerman is like a disney version of what a bar should be . it ' s pretty clear that the owners come from the nyc gingerman . i ' m really disappointed . they have beer . they have food . but they have no soul . something about the place just doesn ' t feel good to me . it ' s got a gross vibe - like a chain restaurant . the clientele is very bridge and tunnel ( and not the brooklyn bridges which don ' t count ) . the food is just not that special - i suppose it ' s meant to be eaten when you ' re totally wasted and that way you won ' t feel bad about eating low grade meat that ' s cooked in a mediocre way . but it ' s cheap so if that ' s what you ' re after , enjoy . i wouldn ' t go out of my way to eat or drink here unless you ' re a fan of places like hard rock cafe or applebees . this place is just one step up from that . 
we ordered the platter for N . good fresh sea food . flavorful and bold . the way they toast their bread is truly delicious . highly recommend . 
great place i have been going there for Nyrs . , since i am living here . val steve are really nice people . good food , homemade cooking , family style . it ' s a kind of place you can sit down chat , very friendly . prices are fair . i love this place ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i tried to go there around Npm on a saturday and was turned away because i didn ' t have a reservation and all of the walk-in seats were full . i called and got a reservation for N Nam the next day , and there were significantly less people waiting outside when we got there . i got the eggs norwegian ( like eggs benedict but with smoked salmon ) , which was delicious . i tried some of the scrambled eggs and puff pastry , and the puff pastry was buttery good . the french fries that bobby flay raves about on " the best thing i ever ate " were good , but not good how he describes it . he likes the fries because of their crispness . maybe the top N N of our fries were crisp , but the rest were pretty soggy at the bottom . i like all kinds of fries , so the sogginess didn ' t bother me - in fact i liked them better the more i ate them , but they just weren ' t how bobby flay described them . the sticky bun from the bakery is the best sticky bun i have had yet . the pumpkin scone was like any other scone . 
i drank too much wine , ate too much pasta , and ordered too many desserts . that ' s the kind of place frankie ' s N is an over-the-top explosion of excess , bleeding brooklyn charm . the cavatelli is as good as everyone says , a giant mess of sage and butter and fat coins of hot sausage enrobing the morish pasta . the octopus and dandelion salad is exactly the perfect appetizer , an offsetting dance of meaty cephalopod andlightly marinated green olives . the sausage and polenta tastes as if one upended the platonic ideal of fairground sausage and onions over a buttery pool of corn . none of these things is sophisticated or fancy . they ' re just ridiculously good . nb i also enjoyed my N half liter of house wine . no , it ' s not the best wine , but it was decent wine at the best price . 
yummy . mad cheap . 
i ' m a sucker for a good happy hour on a saturday , and redwood looked like a real winner before our turkish dinner nearby . unfortunately , it was pretty disappointing from start to finish . we snagged a nice two-top in the window for people watching and ordered a cocktail and a solid cask beer . mixed drink was pretty good , but not inexpensive , even on happy hour prices . the beer was great , but the server brought it over two-thirds full ( literally ) . i got a little agitated and decided to send it back , which did not appease the bartender or the server . the oysters were an absolute disaster and we shouldn ' t have eaten them . if i hadn ' t just sent back a beer , these would have gone back as well . they were horribly cleaned , and they didn ' t cut the mussel , so they were tough to get out of the shell . do not order these if you happen to drop by . the wings are ok , but for N at happy hour , they bring you seven small wings , which is not much of a deal . the bigger issue was my second beer that came out exactly the same as the first two-thirds full ! this time i didn ' t hesitate to shoot it back again , which the server scoffed at . overall , i don ' t see us making a return visit here . 
this area really needed a place like this . . . . . everything is so fresh and delicious . perfect place for a quick sandwich or to take a entire meal home for the family . i will definitely cater my next party from kate ' s kreations . love it . . ! ! ! 
i really like this bar , i don ' t know why i am not here everyday . ok , for starters , excellent selection of beers on tap . local beers ( pbc and yards and also weyerbacher ) for fairly decent prices . local beers make for happy patrons . on to the food , we started off with cheesesteak empanada served with a chocolate ( and maybe beer too ? ) sauce . so good , they are chunky little empanada ' s , N on a plate with the dipping sauce on the side . the dipping sauce was incredible . i could taste the chocolate only at first , then the beer flavor started to kick in . this was a really interesting appetizer and i would definitely get it again . me and my friends all had burgers , and we all asked for different temperatures . each of our burgers were cooked exactly to our specification . honestly , the way to my heart is through a properly cooked burger . i know what i am asking for when i ask for med-rare , and good dog gave it to me . i added caramelized onions and cheddar cheese and was delighted at the amount of onions and the taste . they gave us another sauce for our fries , i am guessing some type of aioli , and it was great . i love getting different dips for fries because ketchup can get boring . on to my next topic , the fries . a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries . i think the mixture is brilliant . it is nice to get a bit of variety without making a complete switch . way to go , good dog . i am thoroughly impressed . 
i only had a drink at freemans but i am definitely going back for dinner as soon as possible . i love the fact that my friend had a vague memory of this lovely restaurant tucked down one of the too few alleyways left in the lower east side . i was so happy to look down this cobble stoned alley to see the happy little crowd mingling about waiting their table . we decided , being Np . m . already that we would just grab a drink and come back some other time for dinner . the bar was busy but pleasant , the restaurant was packed but cozy , they somehow manage to make everyone feel at home in this small space . i loved the lighting , the arrangement of the tables and i cannot wait to go back for a meal . 
i went to a restaurant in elizabeth nj , called valenca , on N monroe ave . i was furious with the amount of health violations i observed . food safety at this restaurant is not there top priority . here are a few items that i observed on the dining floor . i cant even imagine whats going on in the kitchen . N . the bartender is the one who cuts and divides the bread for the tables . which is fine , but i never once saw him wash his hands and he was not wearing gloves . i was at the bar for an hour waiting for a table . he is also the one who takes money in from customers , handles togo orders , and takes out the garbage . his hands were everywhere except the sink . N . this is what really put me over the edge . so the wait staff as they are cleaning the tables they take any left over bread and places it on the bar . the bartender grabs the basket of leftover bread and puts the basket of bread on the other side of the bar . he then discretely drops the bread inside the same cabinet where the fresh bread is stored . so this restaurant is reserving bread that customers left behind . i cant imagine what else they reserve in the kitchen . i saw him do this with every basket of bread that was placed on the counter . . . this was unbelievable . N . at the bar i also observed roaches . N . through the kitchen door i observed the wait staff garnishing the food with there bare hands . i would never eat there again . unless they get there act together . i really wish i could of recorded them recycling the bread . disgusting . 
very small portions , but magnificent food . only one thing that i would advise against - the scallop appetizer . it was flavorless and very expensive . the wine recommendation was excellent . worth experiencing . excellent service . great for a romantic evening , especially if you ask to be seated upstairs . 
great view ! great food . unbelievable service . fred is the man . people complain about the prices , but anywhere you go fro good seafood , you ' re going to pay . the king crab legs in the spicy cajun boil were amazing . def go for the mini crabcakes as an app . bloody mary was exceptional and the old bay rim and raw oyster on top was a great touch . cant wait to go back all summer
not a great place for wine . not a great place for pizza . pretty good place to stop in if you can ' t get into any other restaurant in a five block radius . i bring my mother here , because she loves undercooked dough and sweet sauce . 
the best pizza ! take it from a pizza lover this place is pizza heaven ! it ' s made fresh and the ingredients are very tasty . yes , it does take about N-N min waiting in a line outside to grab a seat in the house ( even in freezing weather ) but it ' s worth the wait . when in nyc be careful to fall into the " all pizza in ny is good " type of thought because not all pizza is good in ny . you have to choose carefully and wisely . this place has been around for years and after my first visit Nyrs ago in the city nothing has changed about their service and quality of food . i absolutely recommend it and its a must for a first visit to nyc . 
i ordered a salmon croque to-go but they gave me the less expensive ham croque . it was quite disappointing that they would make a mistake like that and downgrade my meal . the ham croque had excessive rosemary leaves inside the melted cheese and these stuck in my throat . i will most likely never return . 
home-made , delicious peruvian food . the staff is very nice , everone was smiling and the food was really good and portions are large . if you don ' t know what to order - just ask for a picture menu - great idea , by the way . i had a fried rice special , which included chicken , beef , and a lot of seafood . everything was fresh , and the atmosfere is great . would definitely go back and reccomend to anyone . 
very over priced . i ordered the lobster bisque . N . N and you have to order a bowl . it was watery and N little pcs of lobster . i asked the waitress about it and she said they put other spices in it . i would have asked to speak to the manager , but i was out with my niece and did not want to spoil her dinner . i don ' t think i will go back . 
food and service were outstanding . we had the chicken for N . it was absolutely delicious . they also brought nice little treats throughout the meal . each little treat was delicious and inventive . my girlfriend had steak which was excellent . we picked a nice pinot by kistler . it was priced on the high side but drake very well . i also liked the fit out and the spacing of the tables . we were able to have a conversation without being overwealmed by the background notice . well done ! i will definitely return . 
the burger is too small ! call me crazy , but when i order a burger fries , i ' d at the very least like to feel satisfied . i ' m not j . wellington wimpy from ' popeye ' eating stacks of burgers i ' m a normal guy ! this felt like a child ' s portion . i ' m not looking for anything crazy either , a nice normal N-Noz burger fries will leave me more than satisfied . with that said , the burger is great . probably among the best in nyc , but it ' s way too small . everything else i ate tried was excellent , and i ' d like to go back but i ' m torn on the extremely small portion . 
the service was terrible . my waitress was rude and inattentive . the salad bar should be shut down for numerous health violations . the food was the same bland over priced diner food you can find at any other diner . do your self a favor and go the galaxy diner down the road . 
very cute date spot , family owned and operated and very polite helpful service . great recommendations as well as phenomenal specials off the menu . i had the " mexican special platter " it had steak , chorizo , beans , fried plantains , avocado and egg . it was a bunch of different flavors put together with a homemade hot sauce . great for a quick dinner or cute date for two . 
bier good . food bad . great selection of beer and nice atmosphere to sit and enjoy in the evenings . however , do not waste your money on the food - our sandwich was expensive and inedible . i rarely make comments to the waitstaff , but this " gourmet " sandwich was so bad i thought they might want to avoid serving it to other patrons - and also perhaps offer me something else to soak up some of the booze . however , when i told the waitress how awful it was she responded with , " yeah , i know - i had that sandwich once and it was pretty bad . " she shrugged her shoulders , dumped the check on the table and walked away . even decent food would work for me since the selection is so nice . " gourmet food " it is not . 
let me state that i have always had a great time at katmandu and rho before . however , despite the fact that several people from my group called the night before to inquire about the cover charge policy , management did not honor the time limit . we were all told that a cover charge would not be required if we got there by N pm . we got there before N but was then told that the cover charge was now being taken at N N pm . one of my friends who had gotten there earlier , spoke to the manager who refused to rescind the charges . then i asked to speak to the manager and the security guard lied and directed me to a female employee who was not the boss . i said that that wasn ' t the manager since my friend had already spoken to him . it turned out that the manager was standing behind me , without identifying himself . when i protested the cover charge , he said he did it because it was raining and the band was being moved inside . i told him that that was bad business practice but it did not matter to him . he said he couldn ' t do anything for me and still refused to refund the money . my friends and i had a great time with the band anyway but it left a very bad taste in everyone ' s mouths . i have never gone to a club where the management arbitrarily changed the time of the cover charge . i told him that it was wrong , that he could have noted the change on the club ' s website and that he should have inform his employees to state that the cover charge policy could change when people called . i also told him that everyone would be telling their friends about this too . therefore , it appears that although the restaurant is repositioning itself for a more upscale clientele , its attitude towards its patrons is disrespectful and unprofessional . i am disappointed because rho has so much more potential but will turn off people it this situation continues . if you want people to come , you have to be consistent and fair . what a shame ! 
 N akamaru ramen if you ' re into ramen and you are in ny - it ' s worth a try , since it ' s pretty damn good . definitely not a place to go often as it is overpriced - even for the flavor the value isn ' t there . be prepared to wait - our wait was about two hours . get there early as they stop serving as soon as they are out of ramen . N for extra noodles - make sure you don ' t drink all of the soup if you ' re a big eater . ( they don ' t give you that much anyways ) 
this is my first ever review . i was compelled to write because of the exceptional attitude of the service we receive . doing a good job is not hard , but how you deal with a situation when something goes wrong really shows who you are . there were two of us , ordering sandwiches N N , one with a roll and one with a wrap . when they arrived , i must have made a little noise due to my disappointment that the wrong bread went on my sandwich . i ' m not one to complain , and would have eaten it as is , but our waitress said , " what ' s wrong , tell me . " she whisked our sandwiches away immediately to correct the situation . she brought our sandwiches back with a smile , and let me tell you , not only was the service exceptional , those sandwiches and fries were delicious ! 
awesome breakfast until N N weekdays . also visit during restaurant week for a special swordfish and watermelon gazpacho deal . very good place to have brunch and the staff is friendly ! 
i grew up in a german household , as a matter of fact my dad was a sausage maker and our best friends owned a family brewery , so if there is one thing i know - it ' s good german food . this place is all it . it ' s young , hip and feels like a beer hall in germany . yet right outside is south street . jeremy nolan the chef grew up in berk ' s county and learned german cooking at the german clubs that dotted berk ' s county when he was growing up . his wife is a master pastry chef and makes one of the best apple strudels that i have ever eaten on this planet . jeremy keeps the german tradition , but has updated the menu to modern tastes . i love the sauerkraut here . i love the schweinhaxen and the spaetzle is super . you can ' t go wrong with any of the sausages and the rot kohl is like my mom use to make . the wiener schnitzel tastes like austria . the menu is super and authentic . the bar is large and you might need help picking the beer - they have so many . brauhaus is popular that they will soon expand , taking over the furniture store next door . i love this place . it ' s one of the best german restaurant
not worth the wait . food was good , but nothing to write home about . hostess kept saying tables were about to leave , but that took N minutes . five minutes after i complained ( and i was the third in our party to do so ) we were finally seated . hostess didn ' t even know where we were in bar to seat us . manager never introduced herself , apologized , or even offered dessert . she barely asked how the food was as she grabbed the check off the table . go elsewhere for a better dining experience . 
this is where the young working crowd goes for a drink after work in downtown philadelphia . the lounge bar area was packed and loud on a wednesday evening . it is a great casual and hip atmosphere . the retro tex-mex throwback decor is fun and inviting . if you are not in the mood for drinks , the menu is a made up of traditional and casual mexcana dishes which are upgraded and somewhat pricier . this means that you are not sitting in taco bell and you do not get N large beef tacos for N dollars . but rather , you get N tiny steak tacos ( cooked to your preference ) for N . for an appetizer , the guacamole is great , but a little on the steep side for a bowl of guac and a basket of chips . 
new favorite neighborhood spot , great food , friendly service and good cheap wines . what else needs to be said ? 
the food tastes great . i really like the way they set this place up , the look fits the food . i had expected the price to be over N given they were serving lobster , but then i was surprised when i saw how small the roll was . however , the sandwich was really tasty and it was only N more for a nice soda and chips . all three together made a nice sized meal , even if it looked small on first glance . i would go back . 
had two chicken shawarmas . big mistake because i was full after one . they were tasty . however , the pita breaks too easily and it becomes very messy very quick . 
charming setup and our service was helpful and friendly but definitely overpriced relative to location and quality of the food drinks . 
definitely not one to frequent food found in a cart on one of ny ' s numerous bustling streets , but i must say , having tried it , i will undoubtedly be coming back for more ! great portions , great price , just get there early as the lines can become prohibitive at peak times . 
as a mediterranean raised in greece . . . . . is hard to find place in nyc that using pure and authentic ingredients and their food is as tasteful as back home . people this is my everyday stop . . . . . . my morning start with the most tasteful coffee to go to work , and i end up most of the time ordering lunch and dinner . my favorite dish is the farmers salad and the chicken on stix . i love the atmosphere of this place , i love the food and i love how reasonable it is compare the quality it provides . we need more restaurants like stix . great food , great service . great prices everyone must try ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
awesome authentic mexican the real deal ! ! ! the tacos and tostadas are awesome . . . . burritos not so much its their rice its not very good to be honest . great staff great food other than the rice . hurry up before the hipsters start flocking there and the mexicans jack up the prices to meet the grubby hipster demand . 
my girls took me here for a casual baby shower saturday brunch and we all were big fans . i had the bluberry and scrambled egg crepe which was pretty much a glorified french toast with fresh blueberries on top . it was really yummy but i should have asked for the maple syrup on the side b c it was drenched in syrup and super sweet . i would have enjoyed it better if i was able to control how much syrup i got in each bite . in terms of the ambiance , we absolutely loved it . it ' s a super cute spot to dine and has a wonderful relaxed atmosphere . the coffee was also superb from what my friends said ! we definitely plan to come here again ) 
food is good definitely a place i will come back again and try service is pretty good as well sometimes it ' s very hard to find service and great food
a few friends have been telling me how great this chicken over rice was , i had to try it when i was in nyc . i heard about the long lines but i went there at the right time ( just before lunch ) and only had to wait a few minutes . the chicken over rice portion was huge for only N ! ! the chicken was so tender and juicy and the rice was cooked just right . the sauce was really good too and added some of their hot sauce . i ' m definitely going back again next time i ' m in nyc . i hear it ' s good for a late night snack . 
our parting memory of park avenue tavern sums it right up-douche in his N ' s w his cronies hanging over the bar while myself and a co worker walk out after lunch shouts out " well it ' s strange to see women in here " . . . dude we are not in the N ' s . that ladies , sums the park ave tavern right up . i was there for a work event a couple of mths ago downstairs and had a good time , hey free vodka , what could go wrong . so myself and a coworker decided to check it out for a late lunch one day . when we walked in the bartender nearly fell over the bar trying to talk to us , maybe i ' m wrong but the hostess that was seating us was doing her job and seating us so please go back to making drinks ! it was quite bizzare and we both swore he was drunk . service was prompt and our server was very sweet and i felt so sorry for her as the place just temmed with obnoxious testosterone , largly in part due to the loud bartender who clearly wanted to be the centre of attention . we got our food and it wasn ' t bad , the hummus was really good and so was the tomato soup however the mac and cheese was really bland . we had a glass of wine each and had planned on staying and orering entrees but the atmosphere took a dive pretty quickly when douche in his N ' s and all his friends walked in . it ' s kinda crazy how one group of people , who clearly had a bromance going on with the bartender , can change the atmosphere in a room . after all the hugs between douche , his cronies and the bartender were done , the bartender turned around and loudly said to these old men , " look at the two girls over there " . . how subtle and classy . . . the N guys decided to turn around and ogle us , it really was so uncomfortable and embarressing . . . check please . and then they proceeded to watch us get up from our table and conviently all leaned up against the bar and smile at us creepily up and down as we walked out the door . . bartender included ! ! look i ' m def not a prude and go to clubs all the time but this was just plain uncomforatble , sexist , creepy and weird , we were both in our office clothes so it ' s not like we were screaming for attention . avoid at all costs
love this place . i ' ve been there N times and it ' s been excellent every time . the fresh mozzarella is some of the best i ' ve ever had . hang over pizza is delicious , as is the lasagna and pork shoulder . it ' s very affordable for the quality of the food also . if it was in a better location , i ' m sure the prices would be way higher . drinks are pretty cheap also . 
can ' t say enough . food was absolutely delicious . top quality and felt like it was just made for you . every detail of the meal was well thought out . can ' t wait to return and try the dinner menu . 
we had been here before and it was good . last night was new year ' s eve and we made reservations for N pm . when we arrived there were lots of people . we put our name down and we were told it will be N minute wait . an hour went by and we went to find out what was going on and when we went to hostess desk we were told it will be a while . we come to find out that in talking to people they were there since N and still not seated as of N . we all went to talk to the manager who had no idea what to say or do . they did not offer any apologies or drinks or snacks . the manager ran into the back and started serving food to tables and pushing dirty dish carts . he left the front hostess stand and disappeared . we finally left after waiting more then one and half hours and will never return . 
i agree with the other posts . this place is really awful . the night waitress was really rude , ruined the whole meal so can ' t even say anything good about the food . the waitress needs a lesson on health codes or a visit with the healh department . she took dirty glasses from one table by inserting her hand into the glasses then proceeded to the next table to fill water glasses . she was training another waitress so i hope she does not use the same unhealthy practices . not a good experience . 
i ' ve been wanting to try pylos for quite a while but every time i ' d try to get a reservation they were always booked . i finally made a reservation a few weeks in advance and was really excited to try it . while the entire experience was good , it was not worth the hype of having to make a reservation N weeks in advance . we ordered the trio of dips to start and loved the taramasalata . the tzatziki was decent ( but not better than my homemade version ) and we both disliked the melitzanosalata . for my entree i couldn ' t decide between the lamb chops and the lamb shank . i asked the waiter for his opinion and didn ' t really get one so i went with the dish that had better sounding sides the chops . the lamb was flavorful but cooked a little more than the medium rare i had asked for . i wish i had gone for the lamb shank-oh well , you live and you learn . my boyfriend had a grilled fish that he enjoyed . he also said nothing really set it apart from any other greek restaurant we could have gone to without needing a reservation N weeks in advance . overall , we ' d go back if we ' re in the neighborhood and looking for a greek restaurant , but neither of us feel the need to make reservations there in the future . 
i was excited to try stone park cafe for brunch--esp to try the short rib hash . however i thought it was sooo gross . it was bland , mushy and reminded me of dog food . i was so disappointed . however the waiter did allow me to get another meal . so i got the french toast--which was really delicious ! however i was so sad about the short rib hash . the hash at mile end is amazing , and i was expecting stone park cafe to be just as good . oh well . not a very special brunch , so won ' t be going back there for brunch . . it was just aight . 
i was lucky enough to have lots of matt marie ' s during their menu-testing phase in new york this summer . the pastrami with pickles and aioil is to die for . i cleaned a whole dish of it myself . and the homemade mozzarella was a dream . i can ' t wait to visit their philly location ! 
place is in need of desperate updating , seats are torn , tables are worn out , dishes are chipped and dirty , place smells . . . . food was cold and gross . . . i would never recommend this place . . . the restaurant should be condemned . i ' m surprised the health department hasn ' t closed them down yet . . this was my first and last time going here . . . . 
i ' ve rarely been inclined to offer a N-star rating before . upstate inspired me - the waitstaff , the food , the prices , the perfect beer selection . we were in the city at the end of june , visited upstate on a saturday night , sat at the bar and were fortunate enough to find shane ( owner ) behind the bar offering suggestions and beer food pairings . he and his staff are the perfect balance of efficient , attentive and respectful of space . took advantage of the generous oyster drink happy hour - the oysters were the freshest i ' ve ever had and i am still dreaming about beer-steamed clams and scallop risotto . the whiskey cake was the perfect final touch . and i thought i loved the city before . 
outstanding restaurant . have been here many times and have never been disappointed . it ' s the only place around that serves schnitzel and sp tzle . they have an exceptional menu full of unique dishes and incorporate many seasonal items . if you ' re looking to try something different , consider something from their game menu . i ' ve enjoyed the duck and bison . hoping to try the ostrich sometime soon . also , the desserts are out of this world if you have room . i recommend the lava cake and any of their sundaes . a great place for special occasions ! 
this place is amazing for being a local spot . it should be in little italy ! ! ! from the appetizers to the entrees and the desserts , i love this place . the veal sorrentino is out of this world and the tiramisu is freshly homemade . delish ! ! ! 
rizzutos is my favorite italian restaurant in the farmington west hartford area . the food is always delicious ! ! ! waitstaff is very friendly and we have always had good service , even on packed nights that we ' ve sat in the bar . the funny thing about this place is that no matter how busy it is , we never wait a long time . we either get lucky and get a table or sneak in at a bar table . awesome food , drinks , and atmosphere ! 
best cocktails in the city
popped in late night for a quick meal , had to wait Nmin which wasn ' t bad as could browse through the store . we were seated at the pasta counter and had delicious bowls of vongole - yummy food for sure and very fresh ! 
the staff are lovely and provide friendly warm service . the enjera ( a sourdough pancake ) went great with the vegetarian combo and beef stew . the food is well seasoned and they use fresh herbs in their cooking . 
 N . N for a great lunch including an app ? wow ! the basil noodle was great , tom yum was ok , chicken pad thai was very good and veggie spring roll pretty good . i will certainly return . my blog has more information about room service , but i can link to it here . feel free to google " free travel genius room service " , it should be first on the list . 
been coming here for N years i don ' t eat chinese food anywhere else . always fresh and the service is excellent . the drinks are nice too . if you go there try their hot sour soup or their egg drop soup . both are delicious . 
favorite burger in the city . best fries i ' ve ever had . always good beer . other than the wait , what ' s not to love ? oh , the cocktails are always a bit stronger than you remember . a pleasant surprise . 
ok , just a warning . the juniors on broadway is apparently not the same as the " original " juniors that our friends told us about . this one was fast and friendly with a great location by the broadway shows . it gets pretty packed after the shows . big difference between this one and the original N . no graham cracker crust . . . period . at all . N . no bbq fried chicken . . . at all . the coffee . . we went around N Npm , but there ' s still no excuse . it was pretty bad . the thai wings were apparently good . they are on the appetizer menu , but you get at least N with a side of sweet potato fried thingies . the N lobster roll was apparently pretty bad . i didn ' t try it and didn ' t want to . now . . the cheesecake N . strawberry shortcake cheesecake was just ok to us . we were going to get the red velvet , but it looked only so-so judging by the yelp pictures . glad we got the strawberry shortcake one . N . strawberry pie . the yelp photos showed a strawberry pie that they sometimes referred to at the strawberry cheesecake . it ' s the strawberry pie , which is basically a cheesecake with strawberries on top . the difference is that it has a pie crust . . . not the delicious graham cracker crust that the yelp photos showed . . . . which is the other juniors . the pie crust is only ok , but the cheesecake is awesome . although we were disappointed , the cheesecake saved the day . N . the devil ' s food cheesecake . wow . just wow . sweet . maybe too sweet . very chocolate , maybe too much , but very rich . overall , it was an ok experience due to the nice server and delicious cheesecake . 
great place ! my friend had the chicken and waffles , which was awesome . i had the eggs benedict on crabcake which was good too ( just a bit spicy ) . it gets busy in there ! but understandably so . will definitely return
this place is a joke . sure , the line at pepe ' s may be longer , but at least once you get in , you get fast service . at sally ' s , we waited outside for N minutes and then waited inside for two hours . we were so close to leaving but we were so hungry that we decided to stick it out . when the pizza came , it tasted good , but i ' m not sure if that was because it was actually well-made or if i was so hungry that i would eat anything . i will never go back here because of the horrendous service . 
amazing crab and pork soup dumplings . you ' ve just gotta try it . and make sure you don ' t spill the delicious soup outta the dumpling . drink it up ! 
carmine ' s is always a success ! ! ! you can ' t go wrong with family size portions and a big appetite . this is my second time here and i always get lethargic from stuffing my face . there ' s italian , on top of italian , on top of italian ! there ' s pasta dishes , chicken , seafood , veal , beef , and lots of other options . there ' s also the choice of adding pasta to your entre if it ' s not already included . i never had dessert here and that ' s only because crumbs is around the corner lol . come here and dig in ! ! ! !

reservations for two on a saturday evening at N N . upon arrival , the hostess is nowhere to be found . waited for several minutes until she arrived from the back of the restaurant . first impression upon entering the dining room i ' ve entered a death-metal concert considering the noise level . hostess initially attempted to seat us at a four-top in the middle of the wait-staff and patron foot traffic , despite the availability of a two-top in the corner of the room . i had to ask to be seated at the more appropriate table . almost on the heels of the hostess , a runner brought water , a cold loaf of sliced white bread and an awful and completely unappetizing mix of peppers and stewed vegetables . no olive oil or butter was offered . our server came to the table for the first time within two minutes of our arrival , and three times within the first ten minutes inquiring on whether we were ready to order . we had not even looked at the menus yet , but feeling the obvious pressure from the server , i offered to place an appetizer order . thus began the strangest exchange of the evening the server seemed to say both that we were not permitted to have any longer to review the menu , and that partial orders were not permitted . i say we thought that , but the noise level was so high in the place that i could not truly understand what was being said , and after the server explained the " rules " , she simply walked away from the table . as a side note , there were at least three or four empty tables , and several more parties which were completing their meals , so table turnover was not an issue . i ' ve never experienced something like this at any restaurant anywhere before , and it was such strange behavior that i considered it a misunderstanding , but a rather significant service failure to be rushed ten minutes into the evening . given the urgency , i was unable to review the wine cocktails list . once our order was placed a few minutes later , we saw our server twice more , for the delivery of the dessert menu and the bill ( all food was delivered by runners ) . no one checked on us during the meal to determine our level of satisfaction . and this is where spasso really loses points . the calamari appetizer we shared was so over-salted that more than half of the portion was left behind . the escargot were served in a stewed tomato and spinach mixture that looked like it had been just slopped on the plate . the flavors of this dish were so overpowered by the vegetables , that if i hadn ' t been looking for the escargot , i might have missed them . i certainly didn ' t taste them . my veal was acceptable , but nothing exceptional and the crabmeat topping was completely flavorless . the lemon butter sauce the dish was swimming in was far to tart and overpowering . my date ' s bolognese dish was served over gnocchi in a massive bowl of thin-looking sauce . given the disappointing nature of the meal so far , we both opted to skip coffee and desert , which clearly annoyed the server since a ) it prevented the bill from reaching excessive and b ) she asked us both three times if we were sure . a final point by the time the meal ended ( at N N ) , at least half and probably more of the place was empty . i guess there was no longer a need to rush the patrons . we won ' t be back . 
went in to purchase a s ' more treat and marshmallows for a vegan colleague , wound up buying even more for myself ( and i ' m not vegan or a marshmallow lover . . ! they were just so good ! ! ) sara was super sweet ba dum tisss and explained all about the mission behind the marvelous marshmallows and invited me back anytime . ( she even gave me an extra treat for colleague ' s going-away party . . . d ' awww ! wtg sara ! ) N , N stars ! ! ! ( ( heart ) ) sweet sara ! 
i ' ve only had a few of their small dishes , such as the meatballs , but they have always been great . the main reason i ' m writing this review is because of their fantastic happy hour . even though i don ' t really take advantage of it , because whenever i come in i always have to get a dirty gin martini with their blue cheese olives because they have the best blue cheese olives i have found so far in this area . 
i have been here a few times . the ramen broth is always good but i find the basic pork broth just does not have the complexity and depth of flavor as ippudo or santouka . the shoyu pork broth again is also very good , but just not amazing . the egg is hard boiled to the point of being dry , whereas soft boiled is better suited to this application . the eggs at ippudo are always cooked perfectly . the noodles are excellent quality however . pricewise the ramen is better than ippudo , though it does seem you get less broth . the bowls are arranged in a manner that is very appealing to the eye . the toroniku that comes with extra pork belly is a very healthy portion of meat . the pork meat itself is quite delicious but again , not as high quality as ippudo . but sometimes ippudo just has too long a wait . like this past sunday , ippudo had a wait of N . N hours for N people at Npm . minca had a wait of N minutes . the place is small but it has a pretty fast turnover rate . it ' s a great little find on a nice quiet street as well . this is probably a N . N star review as the food is definitely above average and it should be on anybody ' s list of nyc ramen places to visit . a friend told me his favorite there is the pork chicken broth mixed , so i will give that a try next time and revisit this rating , but not before another visit to ippudo . 
my notes - N minimum if you use a credit card - seats N people - wait time till you receive your food is about N-N minutes - i ordered the shrimp curry ( N ) N . N for a small . it comes with rice , coleslaw and N pieces of shrimps . i enjoyed my shrimp curry . if you don ' t like a whole lot of gravy let them know when your ordering . - added a side order of shrimp , ( comes with N pieces ) - they have a grand slam curry N . N comes with rice , chicken , pork , sausage , shrimp and boiled egg . - facility could use a little cleaning ( which is why they lost a star . ) - cashier was friendly ! overall i enjoyed my experience . 
this place is great . i usually go to the one by world trade center , but this one has an amazing vibe inside and out . you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the back patio which felt like i was trespassing but everyone i met had smiles , and the kitchen was presentable . the food is good with the mild sauce ( could use some more seasoning to flavor it up ) i didnt dare to try spicy because i cant handle it but for first timers i recommend the mild for starters . this is definitely a date night place when the sun goes down inside or out on the patio , mostly people come in pairs buying bottles of wine ( dont expect any margaritas , or a sex on the beach drink ) . will definitely recommend and go back . used a restaurant . com coupon today and it was a easy process other places seem to throw a fit when you give them the discount coupon . 
i am not really sure why this place has N stars . i recently went here and the service and the food were far from special . when my food came out it was delivered to the wrong table , who subsequently ate part of it and i had to wait another N minutes for the food . one thing that i did really enjoy was the duck nacho appetizer . it was really flavorful and i wish it was a main course . i am going to give this place another shot , because it was really busy when i went there . once i go back i will do a follow up . 
was excited to try out august , especially because it had some rave reviews . the place is super cute and cozy , and the staff was very friendly . however , the food was sub-par . from the appetizers to the main courses , everything we tried lacked flavor . the calamari was rather bland , although the sausage and the sauce were rather good . i had the lump crab pasta and had to load it with parmesan cheese to get any sort of flavor from it . the best part of the meal was dessert , which was excellent . overall , i arrived full of excitement and left rather disappointed . i ' d be willing to return if the dishes boasted more flavor because the ambiance is perfection . 
when i think of mundo , i think of the emerald city . the event space , music , food , hospitality - it is a magical place . we live in astoria and it meant so much to have willie and jon as hosts for a party on the eve of our wedding . i can ' t think of a better place in nyc to have a rehearsal dinner . the food is like the event space itself - original , beautiful and crowd pleasing ! plenty of room for guests to sit and relax , mingle - or both . plenty of menu options for vegans , carnivores - and everyone in between . music goes really well with the space . we had both live music - and a recorded selection from my cousin ' s ipod . mundo was both an exciting and a comfortable place to have our event , and we ' re so grateful for a magical evening that we ' ll remember always . 
my absolute favorite restaurant in the city , and favorite place to take friends who visit ! i usually order a mix of small plates such as the philly cheese steak , pork bao buns , edamamme dumplings ( get rave reviews every time ) , pad thai or kim chee fried rice , and the crab wonton tacos . you can always ask them to temper the number of items in each dish to match the size of your party ( eg . crab wonton tacos come with N , but if you have N people you may want to get an extra serving ) . since i recently travelled to thailand i also love that they serve thai beer ( tiger ! ) . if you ' re looking for dessert - i recently tried the rice krispie treat wrapped vanilla ice cream " sushi roll " . yum . 
like so many , ricalton ' s downstairs snug tries to look like an irish pub , but doesn ' t have much of anything to do with irish food . we tried a drink off their menu , the strawberry basil margarita . it had one too many ingredients and tasted bitter . as an appetizer , we had mediocre jalapeno chicken bites sitting in a strange buttermilk sauce . they tasted just like you ' d expect fried bacon chicken bites to taste from a pub . for dinner we split the guinness short rib . this made the meal . the braised cut , mashed potatoes , and vegetables were all cooked perfectly . combining the sub-par drink , average appetizer and ambiance , above average dinner , high-price , friendly but novice staff and you end up humdrum . next time we ' ll try the ambiance upstairs . 
all about the no-sitting eating area in the middle of the market . the place is bustling and there is so much going on that anyone you bring will be amazed . it is a must for a first timer in new york to get a feel of a city within a city . got the cheese and meat platter . plenty of both to go around for the price . their espressos are delicious as well . only thing is service that was a bit sloppy and hard to come by in the eating area . other than that , definitely worth it . 
a quick update that i do feel is warranted- the ceo did reach out to me to reference my email and this yelp review ( to which he was displeased about ) . the gentleman offered his apologies , and shared with me the steps he was taking to rectify the situation with the staff at the philadelphia location ( new training , ect ) . he also offered a free dining experience , which i do greatly appreciate but declined . i wished him good luck in his efforts and moved on . customer service at the top level seems to be quite responsive , a great plus but i do intend to keep my rating the same as it is based on my initial experience . 
i went here with some coworkers ( a couple of times ) since the food was pretty good . the second time i went , when i ordered something and the cashier placed the wrong order ( when i finally received my food ) , i told him that this wasn ' t what i ordered . the owner manager gave me a huge attitude on how it was my fault . then he charged me more for the inconvenience . summary the owner staff was rude and a jerk . never go back
the food used to be really good here . i don ' t know what happened , but the quality and taste isn ' t what it used to be . 
it is the best except there pricy and it keeps going up . they are taking advantage of it and soon they will loose more people , just like me its now out of my price limit . i will now find a new place to go unless i hit the lottery or someone treats me . 
review for the barclay centre outpost-simply the worst pizza slice ever-tasteless and bland and N . N for this piece of garbage
best amtipasti ever eggplant , artichoke , aparagus , olives , mushrooms , peppers . mmm-mmm . always clean and simple , always delicious and perfectly portioned . plus everyone is super nice . major points in my book for having a completely nut-free menu as a diner that persistently carries an epi pen in case of nut consumption- thank you ! ! 
one of my favorite spots to eat in astoria . the food is amazing always throwing for a loop . the service is better than most places in astoria , my server kathy is sweet smart and quirky . always a great time when she ' s around ! 
great choice of recipes and ingredients that never disappoint , with very pleasing service to round it off . keep up the good work guys . 
i was treated here for my birthday by my husband . my following rating will be based on these factors ( rated from N to N ) and then divided to give my overall score . ambiance price quality of drink quality of food service ambiance ( N ) it was a bit crowded than anticipated for a sunday night ( sept . N ) . despite the noise , we were seated in an area that was quite intimate . i liked the overhead lamps , the low candle lighting and the exterior . it was great that i did not have to wait for long we were seated right away , even without a reservation . price ( N ) although the food was delicious , one is paying more for ambiance than portions . don ' t expect to come here and spend less than N- N for two people . that isn ' t including the drinks , unless you get water ( which is free ) . quality of drinks ( N ) my husband suggested that i try the white zinfandel . i did not realize that the brand was actually a blush but once i gave it a sip , i was in love with it--fruity but not overbearing . my husband indulged in the red sangria , followed by the mix of kettle one vodka and cranberry . he felt the bartender did a wonderful job at portioning of alcohol , which says a lot since my husband is picky about his alcoholic beverages . quality of food ( N ) we decided to get the p . f . chang ' s for two N . N special . both of us ordered the egg drop soup , along with the fried dumplings . my husband opted for the beef lo mein while i got the chicken lo mein . for dessert , i chose the tiramisu and my husband got the cheesecake . the only complaint was that there weren ' t more dumplings . the presentation was great and was finished in no time ! service ( N ) i ' m not sure whether it was because it was so crowded but we experienced phenomenal service on this visit . there were actually three different people serving our table but each one was very knowledgeable about the dishes and the type of alcohol available . stopped by without being overbearing to gauge our enjoyment of our food and drinks . ( i ' m not a fan when servers stop by too often ) so taking all of those factors into account and dividing by N , it gives an overall score of N . N , which rounds up to N . 
this place was spectacular . all of these crepes are made with rice flour which means they are gluten free ! ( though you ' d never guess from the light and fluffy taste ) . according to the nice woman behind the counter all of the sweet crepes are gluten free . the savory crepes may have a soy sauce dressing so be sure to ask about that . as i understood it , if you are gluten intolerant like me , you are in the clear here as long as you get something with no sauce involved . she said they are working on getting a good tasting gluten free sauce substitute so double check with you server . the only down side is that it is super tiny . there ' s a few benches outside but when it started to rain i had to hurry off . also , if you get them to-go you get cute little crepe shaped bags . 
i came here with a friend of mines who recommended their food , because they come often , about twice a month . i tried there-egg omelette with irish ham , cheddar , tomato , caramelized onions , hash browns , sour dough . sorry no pic , but it was delicious . i loved the feel of the atmosphere , and the music was grrN . i can ' t wait to try a different entree . 
a great mediterranean restaurant . the meatballs didn ' t really care for them much . the sauce was great but the meatballs were very bland . the fried goat cheese what ' s not to love about this basque pinxto ! yum ! the chicken wings that we ordered on recommendation of the server . . . were just ok . other things were probably a better choice . the seabass cibiche was very good . nice and light and refreshing then the pineapple dessert was very good . perhaps the best thing we ordered . the interior of this place is really cool . you feel like you are in a standalone building somewhere in spain . probably a N . N star rating , but we really enjoyed it . 
i just catered a party , using taim . they were wonderful , and the food was terrific . delivery was right on time , even though they had to prepare everything before their official opening time . everyone was a pleasure to deal with , even though i reduced the order at the last minute . happiness . 
this place is off the hook . my wife is a huge fan of thai food and so we have tried it in many different states , and this by far is the best . you have to try their spring rolls , and the yum tum soup is great if you can handle the spices . other favorite are thai basil noodles and salmon . all in all , highly recommended . 
man westville is just the greatest . i ' ve been a fan of their village locations for almost N years now , and i didn ' t even know they had a chelsea location . it ' s just the best . long waits yes but you can go during less popular hours if you don ' t feel like waiting . food is just delicious . i make a meal out of the market veggies every time now - even if you aren ' t a veggie lover you will be satisfied . huge fan of the pesto mashed potatoes and kale . cherry tomatoes and bok choy also delicious . turkey burgers too ! just go . a fantastic nyc staple we should all support . 
fantastic pizzas . maybe it was the hunger talking , but it was worth the N-hr wait ! the four of us shared two pies and they were gone in less than N minutes . perfect combination of cheese , sauce and crust . you know it ' s out of this world when you are planning your next trip . can ' t wait to return ! 
carne asada burrito with guacamole is so good . . . for N ! i went on a rainy , chilly day , gladly found a seat , and the burrito warmed up my tummy and body and mind . . . meat was chewy and well-cooked , the black beans perfect . . . guacamole and salsa were fresh too ! so glad it is so close to my dorm ! 
best chicken cutlets ever . food is extremely fresh and delicious . not to mention you get an amazing bang for your buck ! 
great food
my girl works nearby and i was looking for a healthy vegetarian lunch . i went with the mozzarella and olive crostini , artichoke and mozzarella panini . food was delicious at a decent price . the only problem was trying to find parking , i had to park N blocks away after circling around several times . i also ordered out a couple of times and the food was just as delicious , wrapped in aluminum to preserve the warm taste . i can ' t wait for the summer to roll around to hit up their back patio . 
best blt ever ! i have not had the opportunity to sample all of the offerings on angelo ' s diverse menu , but one of the things i ' ve had many times , and must rave about , is his signature blt . i consider myself a connoisseur of blts - having ordered them up and down the east coast in search of one that could top mom ' s . . . never happened . . . . until angelo ' s . thick bread - lightly toasted to perfect crispiness on the outside , yet soft and a speck chewy on the inside . very ample , perfectly done , thick and incredibly tasty bacon - accented with crisp lettuce , delicately sliced vine ripe tomatoes and topped with just the right amount of mayo ! . um um ! nice service , great atmosphere ( fun in the tavern ) and reasonably priced . convenient location , free parking , and a beautiful venue . oh - and did i mention - great blts ? 
unfortunately luzzo lost much of the quality he was known for - the last N times i ' ve been there i ' ve been disappointed by the poor quality of the pizza and it seem that the owners are cashing in on their past fame . i wish they could regain their original dedication and passion and bring their pizza back to one of nyc ' s finest . 
went there with a friend of my mine i had salad with steak and she had salmon i must say everything we ordered was awesome and the service was outstanding , very polite and on top of us ! ! i recommend everyone to try ! ! ! 
their food is really really really good . . . . loved the place , the waitress treats you like family . it is quality but for only , what else can i say . . . . i go there every other week with my wife . 
stuck in philly for a night alone on business , with no rental car and a hungry belly . after much searching i decided to walk to los catrienes tequilas ( or just tequilas on open table ) as they had a reservation open . i am so glad i did ! to start , their namesake and i haven ' t been companions since an incident in the early N ' s so i was unable to partake in their wide variety of tequila and their tequila enhanced dishes , but that didn ' t stop me . they did have a good wine selection and i settled in quickly with my argentinian malbec and their menu . let me start by saying , they seated me well . as someone who hates to eat alone and feels self-conscious about it , i really appreciated that they walked me past the bar area , past the more crowded areas . . . all the way to the back of the restaurant to a small table next to a window with no one seated near by - great touch . i had a cheesy appetizer with chorizo on top that was perfect not to light , not to heavy . their chips and salsa for the table were great , homemade chips with a wonderful pico de gallo as well as a great medium salsa and a pepper plate . i then had the carne enchiladas . . . . lets start with the plating . ever go to a mexican type restaurant and get angry when the rice and beans take over your plate ? well i do . . . and i didn ' t have to worry about that here . a small helping of fabulous black beans ( a bit more than N N cup ) were in one corner of the plate while a nicely packed section of rice ( about N N a cup ) hung out in the other . front and center were N carne asada enchiliadas with a wonderful red sauce gently poured over the top . perfect , i could pull the rice in to soak up the sauce when i wanted to . . . just perfect . save room for dessert . . . i hesitated as few people really make good churros but hold on here . . . they got it right . the churros weren ' t huge , they were a good size , they came still warm , crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside . it gets better . they didn ' t serve them with super sweet dipping sauces , they served it with a caramel sauce ( not too sweet ) , a strawberry jam , and a chocolate sauce more bitter than sweet . loved it . . . now if only it hadn ' t taken me N minutes to get my check . . ah well . the N minute walk back to my hotel past lots of other restaurants was just enough to remind me i need to get to philly more often . 
breakfast here is very good and the prices are typical for the area . service is fast and friendly , but it can be quite loud and feels very crowded because they have shoved as many tables into the room as possible . dinner is standard diner fare , and is somewhat overpriced , in my estimation , though the quality was good . they feature a very impressive display of desserts , though we haven ' t sampled them . . . yet . 
small restaurant but big taste . i ' m a huge fan of their appetizers but this does not take away from how delightful their meals are . the customer service is very nice and the food is even better . enjoy
i ' m a bit partial to this place because it ' s N blocks from my apartment and if you know the area , there ' s definately a dearth of excellently executed italian fine cusine in this area . the setting is beautiful inside the setai hotel - we got here a bit too early for dinner service so had drinks and snacks at the bar in the hotel . the bar inside the setai has great bar snacks as well . ok , back to ai . wonderful wine list with a great half bottle selection for those who want a little wine for lunch but want to be able to still draft some memos afterwards . must haves the sweet bread appetizer with foam . it ' s feels like you ' re eating a calorie free soup . . . . but in reality , you know you ' re sipping up to N calories of light airey ethereal goodness . the gnocchini with crab uni ( which melts into the sauce ) are mind blowing . i could eat this all day if i wasn ' t such a fatty already . this is definately going to be a repeat offender for me . portions are sized for thin girls , not fat americans . i was full after an appetizer and a pasta . . . but i did have some bar snacks from below . i ' d always rather have less of something amazing tasting than alot of crap . prices are very fair for all the effort you ' re getting . apps are around N-N . pastas are N-N . meat fish courses are around Nish . 
the food is really good . the place has fast delivery and fresh food . but customer service , specifically the person who picks up the phone , can be nasty and pushy . i understand , you ' re really busy and you ' re trying to get through all the calls . news flash ! you can be fast and nice on the phone . you can say , " sorry , i ' m in a rush trying to get all these calls , please know what you want before you call . " the food is a solid N stars . customer service can be improved , therefore minus N star . 
rude delivery people . 
great food , great ambiance . a little pricy but i think it ' s worth it . 
loved this bar . every time i visit my boyfriend , i ask if we can go here . i think i loved it for the free cheese balls and twizzlers , but the sports man special was nothing to complain about either . for i think N bucks , you get a beer and a shot . being a pathetic hard alcohol drinker shot taker , i needed a glass of coke to chase it with , but they were happy to provide . free games are also great . we had a jenga competition with other patrons at a neighboring table and won . this place is very " hipster . " just fwi if you ' re not into that scene . 
seems like a great place to take a small group or to get work done . quite an awesome place . 
really fresh and great food loved the meatball and the pizza the salted caramel budino was one of the bet desserts i have ever had ! ! ! i highly recommend the budino ! ! 
wonderful food and great service but a couple things need improvement . when the place is packed ( which it often is ) it ' s super loud in the dining room . i think some acoustic treatment on the ceiling would help substantially . they also play their music a little too loudly as well . while i ' ve enjoyed my food both times i ' ve been there i had trouble conversing with my wife who was just a couple of feet away . the second issue is they allow people to smoke at the outside tables and out front on the sidewalk . there were several idiots smoking out there last time i went and the smoke was drifting right in . the manager needs to keep on top of this sort of thing . 
i went to this new place in the neighborhood tonight and hoped to have a light meal and play pool . after the check the manager came out into the front and yelled at me in front of my friends and girlfriend for not giving enough tip . i went to the back with him to look at the bill and said ' yeah , we tipped N because the server was rude and aggressive for no reason . my friend ordered a burger and fries and when it came it had potato salad instead of fries . the server said we should have said we wanted fries when that was what we ordered . he walked away and came back and slammed ketchup on our table for no reason . ' this is what i explained to the manager about why we gave a N tip . he wanted more , so i tried to hand him more money , but he didn ' t like how i did it and slapped the money out of my hand . i tried to pick it back up to give it to him and he told me to leave the place and not come back . i said that was crazy and he backed down . i hope this whole thing wasn ' t because of my skin color . 
when i went to nyc , one of my must stops was this food cart . why ? well because i have been in austin and ny , where they have tried to match these guys . how can you compare without visiting the original ? i must say we did stop by here early late night , so we did not get to see all of the craziness that i ' m sure swarms this place . it was a little before midnight so people were dressed up , so much ratchetness you wouldn ' t believe . but there there are those families just want some good food . i really could not tell if there was a difference but i ended up at the on at actual N ave and Nrd , not sure if the other vendors were the same brand just at near by locations , but since i was here what ' s another few minutes of waiting ? so the line even at N am was already long . but these guys have it down . you order , you pay with cash and then you grab your plate and move on . conveyor belt success . my gf had the chicken over rice and i had the lamb over rice . it ' s a huge serving and comes in a metal to go container . perfect for those few bites and save the rest for tomorrow morning . our only mistake was trying their super spicy sauce . why ? ! ? ! i saw the white sauce , which i knew i liked , i saw another hot sauce bottle , but the guy before me grabbed their blazing sauce and covered his plate with it . being the man that i thought i was , i used the same bottle and squirted it over our plates . my gf bit into the hot sauce and was like no more ! i was determined so i ate up all of the contents covered by the sauce on both plates fast . by the time it hit my taste spuds and my brain could react , i was literally in tears ! once the heat had subsided i was able to enjoy both dishes , but at that point i was done . we packed up the rest and saved it for the next morning . i must say reheated without the hot sauce , it was still N stars ! 
i am venenezuelan , therefore i should know if it ' s good or not . so read on . . . the place is darker than a nightclub , seriously the lights are completely off , there are tiny little candles at every table , you could be eating a roach and you don ' t even know it . the food is nowhere near venezuelan , the beef for the traditional and national dish " pabellon " was more like mush . not good at all , this is a joke and a disgrace for venezuelans . the problem is that most venezuelans are too " high class " to get in the kitchen themselves , so they hire other people to cook the food and it loses authenticity . not to mention that they over charged us . . . N people and we paid over N ( no alcolhol ) ! ! ! that is plain ridiculous ! i ' ve tried almost every venezuelan restaurant in ny looking for a place that will do venezuelan food some justice and no luck . the only place that the food tastes good with venezuelan flavor is caracas arepa bar , except it ' s crazy expensive , a tiny little arepa costs like N ! ! ! i ' d rather go to miami and gain N lbs on the most delicious venezuelan food almost everywhere you turn ! . do yourself a favor and don ' t eat at el cocotero , but if you must , then please don ' t refer to it as a venezuelan place because it is not ! sorry cocotero , great name , cool website , but bad food . i understand why they don ' t turn on the lights in the place , they don ' t want you to see the food or the prices otherwise you ' d walk out before the waitress gets to the table ! 
thank you to the staff at campus copy . dave took care of all my needs and price was good . great place to have on campus for making copies , shipping things ect
horrible ! ! ! ! i have been to many chinese buffets and this is close to last . one of the shrimp dishes i was eating had barely any edible shrimp . . most were just the tail shells with shrimp in it . . . as if someone ate the shrimp but didn ' t bother to take the last little piece out of the tail shell . . . makes me think they took them out of the dirty dishes and re-used them . . . utterly filthy and disgusting ! ! ! ! 
this place is obviously very good . all you need to know that is the N to N minute wait times on weekend evenings . aside from chavella ' s up the street , that ' s pretty much unheard of on franklin ave . the menu has not changed much in the year or so since they ' ve opened . i can respect limited menus that concentrate on a few great items , but there ' s a fairly limited vegetarian selection . i ' ll not need another appetizer with the roasted peppers and burrata on the menu , and the white bean pesto is also excellent , but the pizzas on the menu , as well as every special they have , seem to be geared for the carnivore . also , it ' s the best designed restaurant in the ' hood , by far . unless there ' s a loudmouth sitting next to your table ( not barbie ' s fault , but it does attract its fair share for some reason ) , all sections of the restaurant are comfortable . they did an excellent job that justified the wait for its opening . 
horrible service , the waitress was to busy talking instead of taking our order . . took literally N mins to get N eggs over easy and not only did our table get half the orders the food was cold . . . . i ate my food Nst then literally N mins later my husband got his Nnd . and toast was cold like a rock . . . . . when you get the food yes its delis but the waitress need to focus on people instead of her friends
i went here for the first time tonight after googling top steakhouses in nj and this one received a N on zagat for food . i was also drawn to this restaurant because it was supposed to be a blend of italian and asian cuisine , very ambitious task . sesame chicken next to chicken franchese intrigued me on the menu . overall , good restaurant . i had the sushi special which they had previously and brought back . i have to say i might have discovered why they took it off in the first place . it was spicy tuna sushi with cucumber . first off , sushi should not have too much rice . there was a very minuscule amount of spicy tuna with a considerably sized piece of cucumber . the fact that the soy sauce came in a small ramiken so none of the sushi pieces could fit into it , meaning unfortunately my sushi always had just a dabble of soy sauce . being that i identified the restaurant for being a steakhouse , i did get to try some of the ny strip which blew the sushi out of the park . del monico ' s definitely knows how to do steak . we started off with the clams casino , which i was not particularly a fan of . i cannot say i have ordered clams casino many times before , but this does not make it towards the top of my list . i had N clams and there was a sour taste that overpowered the bacon clam flavor which i could not get over . i must be fair and talk about the pros with this restaurant . good customer service . friendly , knowledgable waitress . manager was regularly checking up on tables and even help reminded me about fulfilling my special dessert request from my opentable . com reservation comment . i did love the chocolate lava cake dessert . great display . i left the place on a great note because of the dessert and the manager was very caring about the service that we were receiving . i learned from him that the restaurant is part of a family owned village restaurant group which has other restaurants either italian or asian , like taos , village gourmet , and tina louise . i would be willing to try one of the other restaurants . 
went here for brunch on a busy sunday at around Na . while not the most convenient area of town , it was close to the spring garden station on the broad street line . our wait was about N minutes for a party of N . it was a pretty gray and drizzly day outside , so most people waited indoors . it was a bit crowded , but there was room enough and a few seats for use . despite the hipster appearance of the staff and decor , the service was completely friendly and food absolutely delicious . what i loved most overall was that the food was homey and full of comfort without being overly greasy or heavy . i opted for the challah blt , and quite enjoyed it , even with the turkey bacon ! it ' s a hearty sandwich ( but really , can there ever be too much challah ? ) served with a side salad ( which , thankfully , was not overly dressed ) . a perfect brunch sandwich . i also got a side of potatoes and was delighted that it consisted of large chunks of ( roasted ? ) potatoes , nicely seasoned , instead of normal home fries . fresh oj and la colombe coffee were on tap to make breakfast what it should be . my friends ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and special of the pumpkin cannoli french toast . the lemon ricotta pancakes were reported to be a light but tasty choice . and since the pumpkin cannoli french toast was devoured before i finished the first half of my sandwich , i can only assume that what looked like a mountain of amazing goodness delivered on its promise . the atmosphere was loud , which i think is unavoidable in an industrial space . but it wasn ' t obnoxious , and still had a nice warmth from the laid-back crowd and service . i felt like i got the value for what i very reasonably paid , though please remember cash only . 
a nice almost touristy soul food place , everyone comes here for the chicken and waffles but the real winners for me are the sides ! the actual chicken and waffles are a little too salty for my taste and not enough gravy to get that nice meat starch melding that i like . 
order the chicken arepa - very underwhelming . redeeming factors are the friendly wait staff and spicy red sauce that comes on the side . ambience-wise , this place did a good job . another no-return visit spot . 
a delicious pizza place with real mushrooms ( not that canned stuff used at lesser places ) . also their ceaser wrap is extremely dank if you add bacon
indeblue in collingswood was my gateway restaurant into the world of indian food . i ' ll never forget the first time i called for an order . i spoke with heather , who owns the restaurant along with her husband , chef rakesh ramola , and she could not have been nicer or more helpful with answering my many - many - questions about the menu . on that day i ordered chicken vindaloo and from that day forward , i was hooked . i enjoyed a nice long love affair with indeblue during my collingswood days . but then i moved to philly , and i have not found indian that comes close to the deliciousness of indeblue . until now , with indeblue ' s second location on Nth street . happy day ! i ' m just sorry it took me so long to get there . it won ' t be long before a return visit . we started with the spinach chaat , crispy spinach leaves topped with diced tomatoes , shallots and yogurt sauce . super unique and very tasty . we also had the long hots stuffed with paneer . entrees consisted of the chicken tikka masala , chicken korma and chicken biryani . all three were excellent . it was obvious how much i missed this food by the way i cleaned my entire plate ( with the help of some fantastic garlic naan for swiping up the last of the sauce ) . i washed everything down with two lychee martinis which were made exactly to my liking ( slightly sweet but not too sweet ) . i was too stuffed for dessert but changed my mind when we were generously treated to a sampling . there was a fantastic dessert with sticky fried doughnuts and cinnamon ice cream , plus some flavorful sorbets , but my favorite was the mango panna cotta with honey and crushed pistachios . tons of flavor but still light . the pretty decor makes this the perfect spot for a date or a night out with friends . i look forward to my next visit ! 
yum ! 
completely overhyped for brunch . i had the buckwheat waffles - very average waffles . my husband had the poached egg kale sandwich - again , bland and boring . this place definitely needs new items and more unique takes on meals . service and seating area were both good but the food was extremely mediocre . would not come back unless they changed up the menu . 
i just moved into the neighborhood and was so pleased to discover hibiscus cafe . it ' s good to know that we have owners sara and jessica in our corner , working hard to whip out lots of great veggie eats , baked goods and delicious smoothies every day . i even learned about the benefits of irish moss from the hibiscus crew . i refer all my friends to hibiscus and really hope its fame continues to grow so the store prospers and is in my hood for a long time . check it out asap ! - ) 
this place has my favorite martini ever , a blue concoction that i actually look forward to drinking , and i don ' t even like martinis . still , i love it . they also serve food , and while the menu is casual it ' s pretty creative and well prepared . i always like the service , though when the place is hopping you can expect to wait ( probably just when you don ' t want to , but oh well ) . 
N . N stars . i came here with a large group of friends on a sunday evening , and we had to wait for about N-N minutes to get a table . while the place is large ( it occupies both the first floor and mezzanine level of the building ) , i could tell that it ' s quite popular and gets filled up rather quickly . i got the pork soondoobu soup , a staple dish in korea . it was pretty good , although i was a bit disappointed with the lack of enough pork meat in the soup . i also enjoyed the nurungji ( scorched rice ) that was served afterward . one of my friends got their bibimbop , and he said it was okay but not anything impressive . overall , i liked the venue and service , and the quality of food is decent . i would say their soondoobu is on par with those at chodang-gol , another famous korean tofu place in the area . i feel it ' s a bit overpriced , but that is a problem shared by most places in k-town . 
went for dinner last week--had the dumplings ( great ) , the sole ( great ) , and a lambchop special that were probably the best chops i ' ve ever had . service was fantastic decor was simple and clean . oh , and the baklava dessert was enough for three people . 
we enjoyed savvi ' s . it ' s spacious , and the service was friendly and quick . i recommend the various pizza ' s , chicken parmesan , eggplant parmesan , lasagna and its specialty greek salad . pros - good service . - fresh food . - plenty of parking . - low to moderate prices . this place is a good value . 
really good food . really good flavor . a little inconsistent in the quality of the dishes - some aren ' t fabulous - but all are pretty good . definitely nothing bad here . they also have a student discount , which is awesomeeeeeeeeee ! can ' t wait to try other stuff here . they also let you try things before you order them . 
met my friend here to watch some football . good specials during the game and a bunch of beers on tap . bartenders let us sample a few of the craft beers we didn ' t know and they were helpful steeering us in the right direction . burger was good and i love places with tots , especially dipping it in their house sauce . 
i ' ll definitely go back here ! the food is great , and the couple that owns it is lovely and take good care of their customers . 
wow . . . . . i have just found a new love . nothing satisfies me the way a good sandwich does . and saigon banh mi definitely had me smiling the whole time i was nibbling my sardine banh mi . i nibbled because i wanted to savor the good stuff . the plentiful of veggie filling makes the sandwich experience a fresh and healthy one , and it also gives more of a crunch to the sandwich . i love the pickled carrots and radish . and the cilantro gives it a touch of ethnic zest . mmmmmm . . . . . . . oh , and it is a huge sandwich ! for N . N , it is definitely the best value sandwich i ' ve gotten ! and it is deeelish ! problem is though . . . . the bread gets soggy fast due to the sauce , so you can ' t really keep it . but seriously , this sandwich is so good i can ' t stop myself from eating the whole thing ! this place needs to open at more locations . it should be like one of those papaya king dog places . 
nolitas hosted our christmas party this year . N people enjoyed a sit down plated meal which included a choice of appetizer , dinner entr e , and dessert from a special menu they put together . they did a great job getting everything out fresh hot and all together . the food and service were phenomenal , they were organized and were able to take care of everyone ' s needs from table service to beverages quickly and efficiently . special thanks go to happy for all his hard work in helping to make this a great dinner party ! ! 
very nice chinese buffet ! thier food is very tasty and fresh . staff are friendly . great place to bring a huge party there , everyone is satisfied . defenitely recommend this restaurant . 
i was in midtown doing some shopping and stopped by this place for lunch . i was glad i did ! the pizza was thin crust , the way i like it , and i was able to get one slice plus a can of soda for N . N , which is not bad at all for midtown manhattan ! i got the plain cheese pie , and it was made just right . next time i am in that area , i will be visiting there again ! the only thing is , the sit down area is limited to a counter about N feet long and N barstools , so it ' s not really a sit down place if you arrive with a group , you will have to take your pie and soda to go . 
this is the best sushi place in the area . fresh fish , attentive customer service , and a nice , modern ambiance . 
mac and cheese done right . best mac and cheese i have ever tried in my life . the prices are high but good comfort food keeps me happy . 
great food . very large portion . stuffed mushrooms were awesome
one of the first pizza places in nyc and one of the best . i love , love , love this place . the crust is the perfect consistency , i love the sauce and they always seem to get the amount of cheese juuuuuust right . it even delivers well ! ! ! if you ' re going with delivery , i recommend not getting toppings as they can sometimes make the crust a bit soggy . they used to have a clam pie ( not available for delivery ) . i ' m not sure if they still do , but it was amazing ! ! ! ! ! i recommend getting a regular pizza in addition but it ' s a must try . lombardi ' s top five on my list .

delicious . hidden gem in kips bay area . mook ' s is excellent . i ' ve been here many times and tried multiple items on their menu and was only disappointed once . the sandwiches are unique and tasty . the bread is really good--not too soft or too hard . they serve breakfast inspired dishes all day--awesome . their sides are great too . it ' s a small place . not great for a date or anything , but good for a quick bite alone or with a friend and definitely good for delivery . tips - i ' ve tried the following and they were all great ! ! - pblt sandwich - chicken kimchi sandwich ( the wrap form is good too ! ) - battered fish sandwich ( a little bland ) - cold soba salad ( side ) - potato wedges ( side ) - kale and roasted corn ( side ) - egg and pork belly sandwich on toast - an egg scramble dish - all were excellent - i did not care for the miso braised beef ( way too salty for my taste ) . that ' s the one item i was disappointed with . all in all , a great sandwich place . i will come here often . 
came here a couple of times before for lunch and it was mediocre at best . . . felt lazy and didn ' t want to drive to new haven for dinner so came here . . . good atmosphere but pretty bad food . . . ordered N wings for N ! ! and they were so small ! ! ! ! ! ! wouldn ' t even pay N cents a wing for those . we then asked for more celery because it came with N sticks and more blue cheese and they charged extra for both ! ! ! i don ' t mind paying a lot of money for food only if it ' s worth it ! ! ! so angry ! ! ! ! burger was average and salad was pretty good . not going back . over priced food . 
we are yelp travelers . we come into a new town , and check out the most interesting restaurant we find on yelp . misery loves company did not let us down . the food was fantastic , and the enthusiasm the staff has for the food is real . the only reason they don ' t get N stars is because they leave you with the feeling that they are more interested in playing with the food than running a restaurant . 
ate here last saturday night . everything from the service to desert was exceptional . strongly recomend the double cut pork chop . and the peanut butter pie was amazing ! ! definitely will be back ! 
i think you come here just for the one thing . . . the crab meat soup dumplings . they are terrific . we ordered one and then . . . decided we had to get another . better and definitely fattier than the west coast din tai fung in arcadia , ca . wasn ' t impressed with the shanghai noodles and the soup sucked . yeah . . i ' m just going for the crab meat soup dumplings . soooo good . service was a tad too rushed . . . but , that is chinatown . 
i ' m a true believer in giving credit where credit is due and the hidden vine did everything right last night . our server was knowledgeable about the food and wine and made some solid recommendations . we started with the bacon wrapped , gorgonzola stuffed dates ( amazing ) , moved onto the strawberry pear salad ( very good but the raspberry dressing was a bit too sweet for me ) . when we were halfway thru the apps , our waitress returned with apologies from the kitchen they were out of the salmon my dinner companion had ordered . normally a huge faux pas in my book but they recovered well . not only did she bring a sampling of paia to taste when he considered ordering that as replacement but she returned ten minutes later with a complimentary appetizer from the chef . . . four wild mushroom ravioli topped with shrimp . the pasta dinners were tasty and plenty for two meals . we ordered an oreo mousee pie to go and let me tell you , what a great way to end the night . it ' s nice to see a restaurant getting it right . we ' ll definitely be back . 
was super happy with not only the quality , but the presentation of each dish . server was fast and friendly . stocked up on some sake and wine a block away , as they are a byob . would go back anytime i ' m in town . some of the freshest fish around . 
taverna kyclades is truly what greek food in astoria lic is all about . as a loyal fan of opa ! opa ! for years , migrating with carloads of friends hungry for souvlaki and gyro from the bronx , opa was the gold standard for me . until i discovered kyclades . firstly , don ' t be thrown off by the wait , when you ' re talking about the best of something , there ' s going to be alot of people clamoring for their greek salads , impeccable cold dips , and perfectly grilled meat and fish , for sub-market costs . to quench the clamoring , the lovely greek woman who greets you at the door , and is extremely good at her job , hands you some wine and tells you to have a drink while you wait . never saw that anywhere , and hooked me from the first time . last night was my Nth visit , and as always , there ' s some new thing i discover there and swear will be the only thing i order next time because i over-ordered . first , it was the char-broiled , yet somehow impeccably juicy chicken kabob , the size of my forearm , and served with their tzatziki . the time after that , the greek style shrimp , with a light tomato sauce , crumbled feta and large broiled shrimp that combined to form a somewhat melted , feta-ey tomato cream sauce while the grilled shrimp bathed in it , really good stuff . last night , it was the swordfish kabob . basically everything i said about the chicken , but better if that ' s possible . tender in the middle , charred on the edges , and fall apart flaky , with a dollop of tzatiki , doesn ' t get any better . it also comes with a nicely prepared rice pilaf , loaded with flavor and not dry at all . the dessert is a custard wrapped in filo , smothered with honey and cinnamon , that creates the perfect sweet bite after all the savoriness . and it ' s complimentary , but i would gladly pay for it . all in all , go with a group , have some wine , and have a great time at astoria ' s best greek spot , hands down . 
the best italian food in this world . come in and just taste anything , you will be hooked ! love it ! 
i have a background in small businesses so i might be bias . comparing this chinese restaurant to the others around town i really favor east . although they are a bit price you pay for what you get , and that ' s quality . they have a very diverse menu from thai , to americanized chinese food to authentic cantonese chinese food and even japanese food . although the japanese food is limited i believe they are expanding . the place isn ' t that big , but they staff are quite nice . i would definitely recommend to try this place if you are in the town and looking to try something new , and if it isn ' t your kind of place the first time you go , then don ' t go again , but i would suggest you let the manager know if you are not satisfied they are really nice in a way that they will give you a discount or something . also if you become really good friends with the staff they give you free food sometimes . 
i spent Nyrs of my life as a vegetarian . looking back , i often wonder what i was thinking . life is short , why live so many years devoid of the stupefying glee that follows biting into a slice of crisp , sizzling bacon or a five napkin , drip-down-your-arm , grill-charred burger ? is any food truly better sans meat ? sure , an apple on its own is a stand-up snack , but when pureed into apple sauce and served with the perfect pork-chop . . . you have magic . even chocolatiers have realized that the salty crunch of bacon has the unique power to illuminate a truffle and give an ordinary chocolate bar a whole new dimension of flavor . naturally , with this knowledge in mind , i was filled with haughty skepticism on the trek to taim . my mind riddled with memories of the bland vegetarian dishes of what i like to call my " lost years . " as we turned down falafel street i immediately noticed the building was small , like . . . walk-in-closet small , and the overwhelming crowd did little to quell this image . yet there was a certain undeniable cozy charm that enveloped the restaurant and its patronage , now spilling out into the street . it ' s that kind of place where you know everything is made fresh , and with the precision that only love and tradition can induce . when we finally received our falafel plate , my trepidations had slightly faded , but that first bite caused me to rethink my entire philosophy . how could anything vegetarian be this good ? the falafel had a crisp bite , yet a moist and fluffy , perfectly seasoned interior . the israeli salad was palate cleansingly fresh , and the pita was unlike any pita i ' ve ever tasted . the plate also comes with three side sauces and , while i normally discourage adding sauces to an otherwise complete dish , these each serve to elevate the other components in a deliciously unique way . i don ' t care if you are afraid of mediterranean food , or if you can ' t spell , much less properly pronounce the items on the menu . i don ' t care if taim is waaaayyy across town . i don ' t care if you don ' t like sitting outside or rubbing elbows with fellow diners . . . literally . just go . try it . trust me . . . and you ' re welcome in advance . 
i don ' t hate this place , but i don ' t love it either . with me , it ' s definitely been hit or miss . the place itself is nice enough , but it ' s difficult to stay and drink your coffee or whatever , since it ' s usually pretty crowded . their vegetarian soups are really good ( and it ' s nice that they have vegetarian soups all the time ) , and the bourekas ( sp ? ) are pretty yummy . the chopped salad is also a good choice . but i haven ' t been that impressed otherwise . sometimes it seems like it just needs a good scrub , and the people waiting on you are definitely hit or miss . i ' ve had some lovely , pleasant people help me there , but a lot of the time , they are not that engaging , and i ' ve experienced a few times when the person at the counter seemed really angry . i wouldn ' t never go here . but i don ' t go out of my way to go . 
best bar in the world . 
i stopped in here for dinner last night with two girl friends , ( yelp , i couldn ' t check in ! what gives ? ! ) i haven ' t seen in years . i was racking my brain for place with great ambience and consistently good food . ( after all , this is my reputation as a yelper here ! ) the restaurant atmosphere never disappoints . the hosts were very attentive to the comments i left on my reservation with i really appreciated . the order tuna pizza- presentation- ok , great flavors pan fried pork dumplings- very yummy , not too greasy , great presentation calamari salad- meh presentation , but the calamari complimented the greens very well . kobe beef satay- tender , yummy , nice presentation lobster fried rice- group favorite aged charred beef- all the dishes were very well prepared and consistently good . dessert dim sum donuts , they came to the table warm and toasty with the three dipping sauces , it was my friends birthday , so she got the festive sparkler ! i got the girls to break sweets restriction without much hesitation , they were that good . she was a giddy as can be and i knew that my hostess duties were a success . they raved about the great time they had and all the great flavors they had tasted throughout the night . good job buddakan , i would have come back with yelper ' s avengence , had you tarnished my spotless restaurant recommendations ! ! towards the end of the meal , i was getting a bit annoyed that i had to make an effort to get our waitresses attention , but she bounced back with our check with great speed so i couldn ' t be too critical of her performance . my friends were happy and got a photo op with the big buddha ! thumbs up . 
still a showstopper . they change the menu frequently , but thank god always keep the pork sliders . best restaurant in bklyn , and one of the best in nyc . 
yes . went here for some late-night desserts with friends . the place was packed but we didn ' t have any trouble getting a table for our group of N . i ' m not usually a tiramisu person but i got the chocolate surprise tiramisu , and surprise , i loved it ! okay , i love chocolate , so i guess it ' s not that surprising . it was sweet and rich without going overboard , and the berries were a nice touch . came on a super-cute platter with a little flask of chocolate sauce on the side . it was pretty difficult to decide on a dessert - they offer a ton of options ranging from contemporary to classic . it ' s expensive but considering the location , the atmosphere ( lively , upscale , a little pretentious but that ' s offset by the young , semi-clueless servers ) and the selection it ' s what i expected . if you want cheap chocolate ice cream , go to friendly ' s . if you want a trendy , unique , delicious chocolate experience , go to max brenner ' s . 
hot tip bring bug spray if you want to sit outside . yikes . 
i never write reviews for any restaurants on any website . if you like exceptional italian food , this is your spot . trust the chef and get the special . i had squid ink linguine with crab in a spicy tomato sauce , hands down the best pasta i ' ve had in my N years . prices are too low , so tip big and make sure gaia stays open so that i can fly back from my home in southern california to eat here again . 
definitely a cool place , been here a few times and it seems like the chef does a good job of changing the menu with the seasons . we had to wait a bit but that ' s expected if you want the food to be exceptional . i hear they do a great brunch . . i ' ll definitely be back ! 
its ok , the food was fine for one time experience . 
food and service are excellent here ! the only complaint here is the some of the dishes are a bit over salted . my wife ' s and i came here on the recommendations of sources like trip advisor , food network , open table , and fellow yelpers . all of these places had great reviews , and i have to say they reviews did not lie and every expectation we had coming here was met . great wine selection , friendly and knowledgable staff , wonderful ambience and a beautiful view . 
i really think it ' s the sauce . they put crack in it or something , it ' s soooooooooooooooo good . i could taste the clean tomato flavor and fresh basil really takes it to the next step . simplicity at it ' s best this is a double stopper for me on my trips to nyc , even if it ' s just to pick up a pie and sit on the curb catching up with my friends if the waits too long . 
nice new spot , like the outdoor seating
so refreshing , flavorful , and simple yet bold . i had the calamari and shrimp salad which was a spicy punch to my tastebuds and my hubz got the beef dry noodle , which was amazingly tender and flavorful . everything here tastes pure . 
had a great brunch sunday morning . fantastic eggs benedict with house made mortadella and english muffin . bring your own vodka , the bloody mary mix is tasty . 
food was okay . its fast food essentially . the food was kind of tasteless and they charged us for getting hot sauce . . 
splendid pork buns ! love the cream filling . the ramen was okayish
i frequent the original pancake house in fort lee and am in love with their gargantuan apple pancake ( think sauteed apples atop a warm mound of pancake and smothered in a cinnamon sugar glaze ) . their pancakes are more egg-y than bread-y , which , for flan-lovers like me , is a match made in heaven . their dutch baby is also a dish you ' ll fall in love with - it ' s like a pancake bowl that holds a generous portion of fresh strawberries and bananas , sprinkled with confectioner ' s sugar . it comes with their fresh homemade strawberry sauce . their omelettes are the size of a football and are also chockful of veggies , meat , or whatever you order it with . and it ' s all so very tasty . the family that owns the fort lee location bends over backwards for its customers . they ' ll make sure your dining experience is enjoyable - you ' ll want to come back for more . 
great local bar with good , reasonably priced food and a nice crowd ! 
best pizzeria ever . the pizza is so different . i would highly recommend this pizzeria to anyone . my favorite is the chicken alfredo with jalapenos never seen that at any other pizzeria also the san pellegrino chinotto are so good never tried them before now i consider them my favorite drink . definitely coming here at least once a week now that i ' ve discover the best pizza in ny . . . . . . 
i went to mt on a sunday evening . immediately obvious that the one server was tired , cranky and ready for a long weekend to be over . after being shot down by not one , but two bourbon requests ( sinfully sad bourbon selection at this joint ) , i settled for one of the winter brews . i ' m not typically a beer drinker , but i was pretty happy i took a shot . i tried a few that night and they were gee-double-oh-dee good , if not grizzity-great . we ate a pretty impressive variety of food including the curried squash , pork sandwich , fried pickles . . . everything was really , really tasty . i ' m more than a little anxious to try mt again - only this time i will bring some soothing balms , slipper socks and hot tea for the overworked waitress to ensure that nothing comes between me and the perfect experience . 
august is amazing . the best food anywhere in philadelphia or just tri-state area consistently excellent service excellent food everything on the menu is cooked to perfection and nothing needed usually something so whatever not here she seems to have everything down to a science and i think it ' s almost N years they ' ve been in business so you know what that says something always a great meal . 
there ' s really only N word for extra virgin . . . yahtzee ! my gf and i decided to take a little adventure to the west village from a far far land ( upper east side ) and we stopped to look at a few menus but nothing really tickled our fancy . i decided to go to the well ( yelp ) and see what restaurants got great reviews in the area . i wanted fish so i typed in the proper terms in the search parameters and extra virgin popped up . we took a stroll over there and i immediately liked the aura of the joint . dark , almost french quarter new orleans like , with outdoor seating . the waitress we had was very nice and patient as we had at least N questions about the menu and what the best dishes were etc . we ordered the pistachio crusted goat cheese salad to start ( after convincing my gf that we should try it ) and it truly was refreshing , filling and insanely tasty at the same time ! the pistachio crusted fried goat cheese on the bottom of the fresh greens and citrus dressing was a perfect blend of everything i look for in a starter salad . for entrees , i ordered the lemon crusted chilean seabass and my girlfriend ordered the mushroom crusted virgin chicken . when the manager passed , we asked him what his favorite dishes were and he ranked them in order , mine and then my gf ' s . . . the anxiety to receive the dishes to indulge in was piling up by the second . when they arrived , they looked beautiful ( enough to post a picture of them on instagram ) and we each had our first bites of our respective dishes . my seabass was cooked perfectly , the fennel potato puree melted in my mouth and the salsa verde scattered on the plate was a perfect compliment of flavor to everything on the plate . after getting the chills from my first bite ( it was also a bit cold outside ) i turned to look at my gf and i ' m almost positive she was mid-climax as i interrupted her to ask how it was . she said it was the best chicken dish she ' s ever tasted and when i tasted it ( while her eyes were closed making odd noises ) i immediately understood her feelings . . . it was absolutely fantastic - cooked perfectly , insanely tasty and crunch factor was ideal . we were both so satisfied with our meal that we completely skipped dessert ( will probably order next time ) and when we got home we immediately fell into a food coma . with all of that being said , i highly recommend anyone in the area ( or not in the area ) to go check out extra virgin . . . and i dare you to try not to say yahtzee ! upon your first bite . 
i came here for dinner and it was great . very intimate and cozy . the staff was attentive and the food was awesome . i recommend the roasted giannone chicken and the hazelnut panna cotta for desert . great date spot ! 
delicious mexican food . the taste and quality of the food was really good . ended up going back to the same place for that reason . service was good but the music was a little too loud .
