it ' s great ! 
i took my boyfriend here to surprise him for his birthday and it was the most amazing experience ! ! ! ! thank you to the lovely owners , john and elizabeth , for making my boyfriend ' s birthday so special . he had an unforgettable experience . our server , chris , provided outstanding service as well . we loved everything about this restaurant from the beef and ale pie and quail skewers to the delicious cocktails to the beautiful smoky room to the live music to the incredible staff . . . and especially the birthday surprise ! ! ! ! we loved the heath . five stars all around . 
waaaay over-rated ! if you are a true southerner , or know good southern food , you will be disappointed . the cornbread is dry and the chicken is just average . i think the chicken at popeye ' s tastes better . 
classy place , great food . service is unbelievable . after enjoying a few meat selections , i picked up the laminated meat cut explanation sheet on the table . within four seconds a staff member was at my side asking if there was anything i had questions about or if there was a selection i had not seen yet . i said there was the rib eye that had not been to our table . he asked how we would like it cooked and then was off to send it our way . the bacon wrapped filet was my favorite . a few beef selections were a little over-seasoned . if you agree , just ask for a slice off the piece someone else in your party just took the top slice of . oh , and don ' t pass on the parmesan encrusted pork . i have been there now for a lunch and a dinner . do lunch and save some bucks . 
this may be the worst burger place on the planet , beers good , staffs rude , burgers are terrible . buns horrible , meats low quality and the artisanal burgers on the menu are flavorless . 
my fianc and i enjoyed our meal here very much . i had the emmentaler sausage special , which was incredible , and she had the liptauer , which isn ' t really my thing but she enjoyed it . the decor and " feel " of the place are perfect . it ' s very small , the music is soft but noticeable , and the wait staff is extremely helpful and friendly . oh , and the chocolate cake for dessert was wonderful . 
you ' ve probably walked right by this place on the west side of Nth street and written it off as some terrible hole-in-the-wall bar catering to the bridge and tunnel set given its proximity to patco . not so much . well , though i don ' t know who else was eating there ( nor do i really care ) , all that matters is they had a solid burger with equally tasty fries . i got the burger without the injected cheese that smells like the feet of someone averse to washing them for months on end . i also passed on the tomato given that i preferred my burger sans salmonella . the caramelized onions were great and the patty was just right for me cooked medium . i went with a friend who , given our shared penchant for cheapness , unknowingly also brought the N off coupon from restaurant . com . as if we needed a reason to return soon for another good dog burger . 
my favorite eatery of all-time . the menu is ever changing but is consistently great . the service is always friendly and helpful . the oysters are to die for and are very fresh . they have a great wine selection and the servers are knowledgable about pairings . the N menu items that are constant are the carmel tart and the brick chicken , both are superb . the last time we dined at marlow sons we tried a crostini of fresh rubarb , locally produced ricotta , fresh tyme and wildflower honey on country bread , it was probably the best thing i have ever tasted . 
our family had a wonderful time on the moshulu . we felt like royalty and were treated so well . the food was great . we are from long island , ny . our daughter moved to philly , and we visit her often . we all went to moshulu and loved it . 
this place has by far the best subs in nj and the customer service is top notch ! i would and have driven over an hour to obtain the heavenly goodness of their tuna sub with the works ! ! ! ! oh my i actually get cravings for this place . . . . on occasion ! 
why are there so many sabrina haters out there ? i ' m pretty much a jerk when it comes to criticizing food because i can be , but there ' s nothing to complain about here . most of the people who work at the fairmount location think they ' re too cool for school , but don ' t we all ? fantastic place for brunch breakfast for dinner french toast smothered in heavenly syrup w strawberries and bananas after a sweet love session with your sweet ' ums . 
so delicious ! got the rotisserie chicken and roasted sweet potatoes . also got chocolate bar with figs . yes it can be a bit pricey but it ' s healthy ! ! 
one thing astoria is not short of is greek restaurants . they are on almost every corner but mp taverna stands out above them all . mp taverna offers a complete unique twists on greek classics and not only makes them modern , but it totally elevates them . their food is fresh , colorful , and definitely delicious . this is a regular spot for me and when i go , i always get the mussels gigantes to start which offers mussels in a phenomenal tomato broth with lovely bits of crispy sausage and feta cheese . every bite is a whirlwind of different textures and flavors and the mussels taste like they just came from the ocean . i definitely recommend that as a starter to share . as an entree , the meat platter , the paella , and the roasted lemon chicken were on point . as i ' m writing this my mouth is literally watering from thinking about the great food . now i know that the famous taverna kyclades is not far away and i know that many people are loyal to the legendary spot , but to me mp taverna offers a modern and unexpected experience . skip the long lines at taverna kyclades and go to mp taverna and you will not regret it . 
very fast service and the broth is delicious ! a 
i like simple concepts and falafel is one of my favorite on the go foods . anything simple needs to be done very well . at this place it is . at taim they live up to that maxim with delicious falafel that is so crispy ! really , really good ! ! if you visit don ' t forget to get lots of the tahini over the falafel . it ' s the perfect mix . 
very fresh , handmade rolls . good food . uncomfortable eating in dining area with no fan or air conditioning . oppressive heat in summer
disclaimer . i live in california so what do i know about barbecue ? the back story is i used to come to this place N years ago to drink and watch bands . good times . fast forward , food is the new rock act . i came here with friends last week . we love their barbecue . great atmosphere , still has great beer selection and bar . we had a mix of beef ribs , chicken and brisket . outstanding . i have bad my share of dry brisket--not the case here . divine brisket , melted on my fork . you needed a sponge to blot the chicken-- it was that moist . our sides were mac and cheese , collard greens and slaw . my brother had a great big burger . the khyber has changed for the good with the times , just wear your sansabelts . 
delicious pizza . average price N dollars for a personal pizza , big enough for two people . excellent service . 
go to this place for lunch at least twice a month . the only reason i don ' t go more often is that there are dozens of places more convenient to my office . in my opinion , there is no better sandwich place in the city . at N a sandwich , it ' s a little pricier than your run of the mill , boar ' s head deli place , but well worth it . between the bread , fresh ingredient and the balsamic cream , you can ' t find anything this good anywhere . the only thing keeping me from giving it N stars is their lack of a good , logistical ordering system . at the end of the day though , the only reasn why it may be inefficient is because it is so packed all the time , which has to tell you something about this place . 
this is one of my new favorite restaurants . the guacamole is super flavorful , and i love that they let you specify the spice level . the tacos are great , as are the enchiladas in salsa verde . 
these guys really need to work on their customer service . i was recommended this place by one of my coworkers and went with a friend last friday evening N . N . N . everything was going well within the first hour or so of our visit . i thought that the shrimp quesadilla was great and the sangria was good also . after paying over N for food and drinks , the manager on duty told us that someone had a N N reservation and that we have to move to the bar . we kindly removed ourselves from our table and proceeded to the bar . while my friend and i sat there , we became very disappointed with the way we were treated . this was our first experience here and we had spent a decent amount of money . the manager did not even offer us anything for the inconvenience . i spoke with him about it and he denied admitting that he told us to move to the bar . he quickly disregarded us and went back to performing his " managerial " duties . i will never go back . i work for marriott and my job is to recommend customers various restaurants and attractions . this place will definitely not be on my list . 
yes . it is as good as everyone and their mother is saying . go with the adobada with the works -transcendant . the carne asada was also fairly delicious . the chicken was somewhat flavorless , and the cactus was not their best option for a veggie filling , even if it is authentic and different ( think firm but mucusy . . . yeah ) . the cactus ( nopal ) could have used more marinade or spices to make it interesting . also , they have coke and fanta products in old school glass bottles , but , i don ' t believe they are truly the foreign blend . the orange fanta didnt quite evoke the streets of villarica or the hills of odessa i was expecting . i live a few blocks away and shop at manhattan fruit exchange all the time so yeah . i will definitely be back for more adobada ! 
prices are affordable . i recommend you order before you get there for faster service . i had a turkey burger with waffle fries and cheese combo as well as a mango smoothie . everything was cooked well and was delicious . portions were huge ! food is made fresh , cooked after you make your order . staff is very friendly and helpful . such a nice big spacious place to get a bite to eat . very clean . will return to try the fresh catch ! 
it ' s tough to be the new guy in a town full of pretty good pizza places that have been around forever , but this place is pretty damn good . it is pricy and the staff-not too friendly but i really feel that the pizza and apps are a really quite good . if price is not an issue and this is not just a " quick- we gotta get something cheap and feed these people night " -it is well worth the price . it is about N notches above average , if you care about quality and good ingredients-give this place a shot . 
it ' s amazing that a burrito filled with pico de gallo , sour cream , guacamole , and cheese can be tasteless , but somehow they managed to do it . just strange and bland . the chips were among the worst i ' ve tasted . i liked the salsa bar and that was almost enough to bump this up to two stars , but no . 
i really had a great time at this restaurant . the people are very friendly and the staff are very attentive . i got to meet and talk with the chef for some time , as well . i intended to try a meal and leave . however , N hours later , i was still there talking with new people and trying other dishes , drinks , and appetizers . i would definitely go back whenever i ' m in the area . it ' s a real gem of a find and with a really cool vibe . 
burgers are great . i was disappointed in the duck fat fries . they had the manliest drink i have ever had . its basically whisky and lemon . felt burny going down but was still great . 
hit this place lsat week on my quest to find the best ramen in nyc . i ' m not going to lie . i was pretty damn good . i didn ' t try the sushi but it looked nice and clean . i say give it a go
the thing i like most in this restaurant is there veranda . it ' s nice when you can see the panorama of the city . people are walking along the streets , holding their hands or hurrying back home and you are just watching them , drinking your wine or coffee or smoking a cigarette . the atmosphere is disposes you to romantic and at the same time philosophic mood . 
N hour upscale diner you say ? have myself a bbq chicken panini delivered to my home at N N am after a full night of carrying-on in the city ( seamless of course ) ? yes this is all at your fingertips with sanfords . great menu selection for any meal , large quality portions and has your parents favorite go-to diner written all over it . i ' ve actually taken my suffolk county based parents here a bunch and they love it . my dad is into the N brunch special including his spicy bloodmary . the wait is usually bearable ( N-N min in peak times ) so put your name down and chill at the local starbucks across the street . try this place anytime -you will be surprised . 
hands down one of my favorite spots ! ! i love their brunch almost as much as i love their dinner . brussel sprouts are my favorite . very intimate , great music , fun friendly staff and always great food . little baby jesus cake . . . . . life changing
i love these falafels the sauces really work . i would make a mess of myself in class eating a sandwich , but i don ' t care ! it also tastes better because it costs only a little more than a freaking bus ride here .

maybe i just picked bad choices . . . i ' d heard fairly good things about sakura , mostly about the guys at the counter making it , and figured i ' d try it out on my break one day . i got eel avocado roll and spicy salmon roll . the eel wasn ' t bad , but was a little chewy . the spicy salmon was really weird though . in my experience spicy salmon is salmon roll , with a little bit of spicy sauce . this place had taken the salmon , cut it into little chunks , and mixed it with some scallion sauce thing that they put in the rolls and then dumped over top the whole thing . it didn ' t look bad , but tasted really weird . i brought it back to work to give to my coworkers if they wanted any . one said it was kind of weird and didn ' t eat any more . the other said he felt like vomiting , spit it out , and threw the rest away . i ' ll give them two stars because i ' m the first person i know who ' s had a real issue there . 
i stopped in for lunch feeling excruciatingly hungry . after the long line , i was even hungrier . tommy dinic ' s , your puny sandwich was unsatisfactory ! did i mention kinda moist ? come to think of it , my sandwich was actually wet and soggy . the flavor must have been on vacation , because it was nowhere to be found . i ' d possibly give tommy dinic ' s a second chance because the meat looks so appetizing behind the counter . if i wait fifteen minutes to pay a pretty penny for a moist towelette sandwich again though , i ' m just gonna pretend this place doesn ' t exist . 
serving up fresh all-beef patties " west-coast " style , pyt at the piazza in northern liberties is the hamburger haven of philadelphia . located in trendy northern liberties , pyt features an outdoor patio with seating in the warmer months with everything from plush , brightly-colored couches to aluminum picnic tables . getting a table is a bit of a free-for-all , but reservations are accepted . like seating , service can be a little scarce at times - we waited about N minutes at a table for a server to bring us menus . pyt ' s menu consists of mostly burgers , but they do also offer vegetarian burgers ( which i didn ' t try , but i was told the veggie-patties were made fresh in their kitchen daily ) as well as salads and chicken sandwiches . their burger offerings included a range of combinations and flavors from " the classic " ( N ) served with bacon , cheddar and all the toppings to their " burger of the week " ( N- N ) featuring new and sometimes exotic creations every week . famous " burgers of the week " have included the " krispy kreme " burger - a double cheese burger served between two krispy kreme doughnuts and filled with N strips of chocolate covered bacon , the french onion gruyeur burger and a veal parmesan burger . as enticing as these options seemed , i settled for " the fat boy monster " ( N ) - two beef patties , each topped with sharp cheddar and crispy bacon , three onion rings , lettuce , tomatoes and " special sauce . " while pyt is known for its fresh burgers , their menu also features a rare treat - adult milkshakes . for those of you who are not familiar with this concoction , it is the heavenly combination of a traditional ice cream milk shake and flavored alcohol - the perfect compliment to a pyt burger . creative names give way to delicious mixtures like the juan valdez - chocolate ice cream with kahlua and patron cafe xo , and the caucasian - vanilla ice cream blended with vanilla vodka and kahlua . the peanutbutterchocolatebanana milkshake with chocolate ice cream , banana liquer , rum and peanut butter seemed like the perfect caloric accompaniment to my fat boy , so i indulged . all adult shakes are priced at N and come topped with whipped cream , sprinkles and a cherry . the price is reasonable for a fairly large serving , not quite enough for two to share , but more than enough for one . if you aren ' t interested in the combination of milkshakes and alcohol , pyt does offer them separately with non-alcoholic milkshakes ( N ) , a full bar and an impressive craft beer list to accompany your burger . our milkshakes came before the food , but we didn ' t really mind . the milkshakes were smooth and creamy with just enough alcohol to enjoy , but not overpowering . they tasted exactly as you would imagine a milkshake with alcohol to taste , delicious . it was only a short while until our hamburgers came out . the burgers were , by all standards , excellent . the patties were cooked exactly to our request and the toppings were generous , yet manageable . it was a over-sized burger better suited for a fork and knife rather than just my average-sized hands , but in the american backyard bbq tradition , i dug in with both hands ( i suggest using your dominant hand to control the tremendous patties and your non-dominant hand to corral your toppings ) . their " hall of fame " burgers come with fresh-cut , seasoned french fries and a deli pickle . the waiter informed us that the patties are purchased as fresh ground beef from a local butcher and hand formed in pyt ' s kitchen every day . a fresh and locally-focussed practice that makes all the difference in creating these beefed-up burgers . desserts are seasonal and were available but we decided that our milkshakes satisfied our sweet-tooth ' s craving . with dinner , drinks , tax and tip for below- N , pyt is a rare combination of quality food and affordable price that creates a real value with college students or professionals looking for some inexpensive jumbo burgers , a fun colorful environment and the location of the newly renovated piazza . pyt is suitable for a drink or a date , and for our dog-owners , ( leashed ) pooches are welcome ! the bottom line going to pyt is like going to a hipster backyard barbecue , with service that can sometimes match , but it is a great spot for some of the best burgers and " adult milkshakes " philly has to offer , if you have the time to wait . lunch and dinner hours can be very busy , particularly on warm summer nights when the patio is open , so be sure to clear some time from your schedule to sit down and enjoy ( responsibly ! ) 
i could rave about this place all day long . the food was excellent , the ambiance enjoyable and the service fantastic . i have several food allergies and the staff didn ' t bat an eyelid when i rattled off the list of things i ' m intolerant to , instead they directed me to the items that could be modified . in the end , the kitchen did not disappoint as i momentarily lost my mind over the intolerant-friendly version of the north carolina shrimp and sea scallop appetizer , i went mad for the new england sea bass and i , quite literally , went all ' world war z ' over the bread cart . my word , that bread was fantastic . it was an evening well spent and the meal service worth every cent . if the dinner prices are too hair-raising it seems bouley offers a N five course tasting menu for lunch , which i imagine is as good as what ' s on offer for dinner . two words just go . dining at bouley fortheintolerants . com ? p 
outstanding ! four of us ate there this past saturday night and it was tremendous . we were across the street having a drink while we waited for our table . they actually walked over to find us and tell us we were ready to be seated . who does that ? and trust me , there was a line of people waiting , they could have easily filled that table . and then the food , omg ! all the entree choices were delicious as were the appetizers , wine and dessert . we had it all . portion size is generous , and the prices are so very reasonable . and the staff was so friendly , even in the fast paced , busy setting , they maintained a great attitude and really made us feel welcomed and never rushed . i found this gem based on yelp reviews , trust me , you need to eat here . thanks to the staff for a great dining experience ! 
visit this shop for lunch about every two weeks when we ' re in the caldwell area i ' ve only had the fresh flounder so far , both the sandwich and the platter , filets are ample and super fresh . . . love having lunch at this seafood restaurant ! 
i give them N stars for their awesome food ! had the fried porkchop with waffles and it was amazing ! just what you ' d expect to eat in a southern midwest diner ! their short rib hash was pretty alright . i wish they had the fried chicken available though ! their buttermilk pancakes were delicious , but definitely had better bellinis and coffee at other places . took off one star for the ridiculous one and forty five minutes wait on a saturday ! but mehh , i guess what else can you expect from a new york good brunch spot ? will be back next time but probably on a weekday or slow random weeknight ! 
this place is hard to find . thanks to previous reviews , we were able to find its entrance on the side of morton street . it was simply playing peek a booo with us . . . . N of us came here on a saturday . please reserve a table ahead of time , because it got crowded early . the place is very romatic with a little outdoor garden where you can drink and wait for your table . food was fantastic . i ordered the pork tenderloin and had a little of my friend ' s duck . the side dish , grape tomato , was perfect . it melted in my mouth and left this wonderful taste of tomato and slight flavor of goat cheese . the appetizers were great . . . must get the clams ( no shells wooo hooo ) and duck ! ! ! we didn ' t get deserts , so i cannot comment on them ! ) 
great ambiance . both the salmon and the filet mignon were off the chart amazing . only two complaints are N ) the wine by the glass menu was too limited and lacked any that i ' d consider very good , and N ) my server was somewhat unresponsive . but the food was fantastic , priced appropriately and presentation was superb . i ' d go back here in a heartbeat . 
good service and good latin food . the flan is delicious . the home made chips are really crisp . the chicken and rice dish is my favorite . 
park at your own risk ! ! ! i entered the parking lot with a dent free car and when valet returned my car , there was a huge ( N , N ) dent in the drivers side door . but let me back up a minute . while dining at the bar , we asked the bartender to put the devil ' s game on . he said that someone was watching the soccer game outside that all tv ' s were on the same cable box so only one channel could be viewed on all N tv ' s . i looked outside saw that there was only one occupied table with N men sitting at it out there , but figuring that they were regulars , decided not to push it , so myself the inside bar full of devils fans ( N or N people ) watched european soccer . after dinner , when my car was brought back by the valet and i noticed the huge new dent in my car , i asked to see the manager . much to my surprise , it was the same guy ( one of them ) that was outside sitting at the table of men watching the soccer game ! ! i showed him the dent and without even denying responsibility , he just pointed at an " owner not responsible for any damages " sign in the corner . i then asked to see the owner was told that he was in spain would not be back for months . i started taking pictures was told to leave . now i go to iberia . food is better cheaper anyway . 
been here once and it was amazing . . . each burger is no more than N , maybe N depending what you get . most are N . N . . . . . the bacon cheeseburger is bang bang and is perfffff . . . sweet potato fries are not overwhelmingly salty and sweet or soggy . . . they are perf ! i think they were N too . . . this place needs to become more well known . . . it ' s amazing how huge the burgers are seriously . . . buns are delicious . . . the place was pretty quiet and one burger with fries took around N minutes ( only one there ) 
good falafels
great staff lots of fun at night . it is small inside but not too crowded usually . the french fries are so good ! 
i ' ve been here dozens of times . the salad with crispy noodles is awesome . the soups are really , really good , and the prices are low . also , i ' ve never had bad service , either through sit down or take out . its definitely one of my favorite places in new haven . i live in nyc now , and whenever i ' m in town i make it a priority to come in here . 
would not return . burger was forgettable . i can recall the taste of a big mac better than this tasteless burger . the fries seemed like fried from frozen packaging . it ' s a burger joint with hollow hype . fortunately , philly has many other low cost burger places worth going to ( some within walking distance from this place ) . 
i don ' t care what people say i am the karaoke king and proud of it ! the place was really nice and the food was good . however , the place was packed to the max when we got there so a couple of us had to stand up . eventually i started to get irritated because of it , until we went upstairs and rented one of their karaoke rooms , for a cheap N dollars an hour ! we stayed for like N hours drinking and bringing out our inner rockstars . i had so much fun and just had to go back again the next night ! 
the food here was delicious , i got the salmon noodles and loved it . their drinks are also really well made and very ptetty . everyone at our table was happy with their food , highly recommended ! 
i can only give this place two stars for the simple fact that they do not put pepperoni or sausage on their pizza . i consider such a thing to be a abomination to the great edible creation we call pizza . if they put these things on their slices i would give it five stars . their margarita pizza is the best i ' ve ever had though . 
a fine place some rate it up there with sally ' s and pepe ' s but i don ' t quite , although it ' s close . it ' s outside the wooster square district , maybe that ' s why , but it ' s somewhat easier to get to and into . however , it ' s been getting more crowded lately , and parking always has been tough . they opened a separate takeout door a few years ago which helped some . 
meatloaf wasn ' t the best but the atmosphere , deserts and pork where all excellent ! lemonade is not home made which was surprising because the vibe of the place makes you think it would be . 
the interior is very brooklyn-esque exposed brick walls , wooden tables ( the one in the middle is communal style ) and kitchen is right where you would order take out . they ' re a little pricey - most entrees apps are N , bit everything is seasonal and locally sourced . i started coming here last year because i was desperate to find some decent pad thai . it was part of their lunch specials ( score ! ) and was absolutely amazing . the sauce , noodles , and chicken were perfect . i stopped by a few weeks ago wanting to have some pad thai again . it was still lunch time so i assumed that the pad thai would be on the menu , and it was , just not at the discounted price . ( N instead of N ) . being a college student , i decided to try something else . there were only N options to choose from , so i decided to go with " grandma ' s rice bowl " . " grandma ' s rice bowl " comes with jasmine or brown rice , cucumber , mango , toasted coconut , bean sprout , kaffir limel , lemongrass , dried shrimp and " boo doo " dressing . i was expecting to get something similar to that of fried rice , but was very disappointed with the final product . i remember smelling a really strong , fishy smell ( like salted cod ) . to my surprise , it was my food . the dish reminded me of the small plates offerings often found in korean cuisine , where there ' s a little bit of everything . the shrimp was salty , the bean sprouts were raw , and the " boo doo " dressing was so salty and sour that it was practically inedible . the kaffir limel withers lemongrass was the best part . also , instead of mango , i got a grapefruit segment and didn ' t find any toasted coconut . i ate it because i was hungry , but felt unsatisfied . my waiter barely paid attention to me , and the person sitting next to me , who i believe was the manager , was eating his lunch . that ' s completely unprofessional . 
udon and dumplings were great . the atmosphere was good too . 
drove thru on our way out of vermont after seeing good reviews , received my pho , had a cockroach . server was apologetic and deducted the pho from the bill . my husband suggested i take a photo why ? never going back , gross ! 
note cash only ! this place was so good i went back again the next day . i brought my laptop in to be serviced across the street from this place so i decided when it came time to pick it up i ' d turn it into a brunch trip . the service from the hostess to the waitress is so exceptionally friendly that i ' d be tempted to give this place five stars regardless of the food . luckily i didn ' t have to worry about that because it was simply incredible . the first time i went i had the breakfast biscuit sandwich with bacon and wow was it good . outside of mcdonald ' s ( and vynl in hell ' s kitchen ) it ' s often hard to find a place that makes biscuits big enough for a breakfast sandwich . as a biscuit lover i didn ' t even have to look at the rest of the menu , i knew this was what i was getting . it comes with scrambled eggs , cheddar cheese , tomato spread , and " optional bacon " but for me bacon is never optional . my parents were coming up from nj the next day so i saw it as an opportunity to go back and try their famous blueberry pancakes . i ' ll admit it was extremely difficult to not just order the biscuit sandwich again . these may be the best pancakes i ' ve ever had . a perfect portion , i was able to finish them but didn ' t need to be wheel barrowed back to my apartment . the fact that i also went to sarabeth ' s central park south in that same week ( not my idea ) only adds to the great value and quality at clinton st . baking company . may throw my laptop down a flight of stairs just for an excuse to go back . 
when dining on a dime think outside the box ( hotdog , dollar slice , street meat ) . for N dollars you can eat like a king and leave stuffed . don ' t be fooled by the imitators ( vanessa ' s dumplings on Nth street just ain ' t the same ) . fried dumplings are the way to go ( not deep fried as i had feared ) , steamed are more like pierogies . sesame pancake sandwiches are also delish and so cool to watch them make it . don ' t miss the spicy wontons ! 
i stopped here with my boyfriend for lunch on saturday afternoon . we were seated outside ( by request ) immediately . our waitress came over promptly and took our drink order ( soft drinks ) . she was polite and upbeat . the menu has several awesome-sounding items . i ended up opting for the chicken tinga tacos and he had the carnitas tacos . the food came out rather quickly . each plate had N tiny , well-presented tacos . they were both wonderful ! definitely not the typical tex-mex food you find at many places . delicious ! ! my only complaint would be the pricing for what you get ( although i knew ahead of time that it wasn ' t a cheap place ) . over all , it was a great experience . i can ' t wait to go back for dinner and try the margaritas ! 
cute little bar to have a nice glass of wine . . . or N or N
astoria has many great bars and this one really tops the cake ! i recently had my Nth birthday here and they were very accomodating of my large party and loud friends and provided impecable , accurate , and quick service ! our server mika ( sp ? ) was fantastic and the bar manager mike really helped make it a smooth and special event . in terms of food and drinks it is not possible to go wrong here . everything on the menu is amazing and they infuse their own liquors to add a flavor punch to many cocktails . i love a place that takes the time to really understand the type of drinks they are selling and not just mix something crazy up . they clearly do their research and taste testing well and make some great drinks . last but not least the beer selection is truly devine and this time of year , with the fall beers coming up and the cooler weather to , combined with sweet afton ' s rustic decorum makes this the perfect fall drinking spot ( and all seasons really ) . thank you sweet afton ! 
best pizza hands down in the orange and milford area . anyone on here that does not like reno ' s apizza is clueless about good pie and new haven style pizza . there is a reason that reno ' s is the best and busiest pizza place in orange ! i know the owners and they are good people that employ students and young people from the town . is the wait staff trained like a N star restaurant staff ? no . but they are friendly , courteous and care about their customer base . they put sausage on my pie once instead of meatball . and within thirty minutes i had another pie at my door with meatball . everyone in the area knows that one of the best pies is made at reno ' s . the restaurant is casual , friendly and a true pizza joint . i would take some of my " knock-around guys " to eat in a place like reno ' s . they use fresh ingredients and they bake their pies to perfection . big d knows italian food and take it from me , you can never go wrong at reno ' s . 
please ! someone explain to me why the best lemonades in brooklyn are not on the menu . my kids enjoyed the strawberry lemonade and my wife and i indulged in the pineapple ginger . my god ! i know it was popular , everyone were drinking it and at times they actually ran out of it . the lemonade they are selling now is an insult to the patrons who spent the same amount of money for the quality drink from last summer . please bring it back . please
this place is ok , but you could do so much better . thumbs up for the decor , ambiance , friendly staff , tasty drinks . thumbs down for the price to quality portion size ratio -- ridiculously over priced -- and tendency to get madly overpacked with people . location might be nice if you lived in center city , but if you have to get there by car , it ' s so not worth the trip . it ' s expensive , and while i could see paying a premium for a premium product , this isn ' t it . 
we were in new york for my daughters Nst birthday . i made a reservation at the gramercy tavern on recommends over the internet . it was well worth it . we had a wonderful evening . the staff were so nice and attentive without being over top . nothing was too much trouble . the food was excellent , sooooo good , we had the tasting menu , seven courses each one different , each one small but after five courses i was beginning to fill up . wonderful will definitely return when next in new york . 
love this place ! it was questionable in the past but the newest owner mgmt have done a great job . happy hour specials are awesome . nightly events like burger night wednesday and tap takeover tuesday keep us coming back . the chef is amazing ! definitely don ' t judge a book by it ' s cover . this is some of the best food in the area . not just bar food either ! over N beers on tap feature some tasty micro-brews and are constantly changing . the wait staff and bar tenders are very friendly and attentive . a friendly reminder to drink responsibly . do not drink and drive . the local small town pd love to stake this place out . 
if i am in new york for even one day , i make certain i stop here for the salt and pepper squid , pan-fried noodle and baby bok choy . this is what chinese food is supposed to taste like . cash only , you might have to wait for a table . . . all worth it . 
our first time going to jesse ' s and it was fantastic ! great atmosphere and attentive and knowledgable staff . she recommended the steak or ribs , so of course i got one and my mom got the other . unlimited salad bar was delicious and the entrees came quickly and were huge . overall great food , great service , and i would definitely go back again . 
ordered N sandwiches for N people . N the original , N the chicken , N the bbq pork was a N mins wait so i ordered N the beef bulgogi instead . gotta say , i ' ve had better of the N and N before ( in manhattan ) , but the bulgogi was pretty good . the chicken was a bit on the dry side . the bread was nice and soft and i loved that they do not cut the bread open all the way at the end so that the fillings do not squeeze out . i also ordered the spring rolls and summer rolls , but they stated that they don ' t make the summer rolls anymore . . . ? ? ? the spring rolls were tiny and they did not taste nor have ingredients of the normal vietnamese spring roll . . . disappointment . also ordered the vietnamese filtered coffee , this was the authentic coffee . i will have to try their so called famous fries and bbq pork sandwich next time . 
let ' s put it this way i am dying for an opportunity to go back . i love tea , and it was great to find this adorable tea house with charming decor and great matcha green tea ! ! yum ! i didn ' t eat too much , but my friend did and he said it was good . . . and it looked like a tempting menu indeed . great place to hang with a friend
one of the worst service experiences i have had in this city ! the host was rude , unprofessional and just downright mean . we were seated at a table , had ordered drinks and he told us we had to move tables with apology . and he publicly made a scene about the move . we left and honestly will not go back . cafeteria used to be one of my favorite places . not anymore because of this rude host . we were seated in the new downstairs . this happened at N N on saturday , january N , N . this host needs a reality check on customer service ! i hope management reads this and deals with him ! 
eh , i don ' t know if i went on an off day or if my visit was normal , but i won ' t be going back here . we waited over an hour to get seated while several people who came in after us got seated before us . by the time we got our table , my stomach was pretty angry . i got the lamb chops and they were sadly dry and overcooked . i do believe i ' ll get my mediterranean fix elsewhere . 
i was indecisive as to post my review to pat ' s or geno ' s , but since we did encounter pat ' s first , pat ' s will have to deal with this review , but please read in its entirety , because geno ' s didn ' t score big either . enjoying a philly cheese steak was to be one of the highlights for my husband during our vacation , so of course we had to try pat ' s and geno ' s , which we decided to eat at both locations on the same day . that was a smart decision , because after experiencing pat ' s , i would have refused to spend money on transportation to go back and even try geno ' s . with all the notoriety , you would think between the two locations one could make a philly cheese steak that we could boast about when we returned home ! pat ' s sandwich ( grilled onions and provolone ) was not heated at all , the roll was extremely hard , and the meat had so much fat that after N bites , i couldn ' t handle the experience any longer . even my husband gave up trying to eat it . however , i decided not to waste all my money , so i proceeded to feed the roll to the N pigeons that surrounded us while we tried to eat . still adventurous or dumb we proceeded across the street to geno ' s . the best part of the meal was there were less pigeons ! however , the philly cheese steak ( grilled onions and cheese whiz ) was nothing to praise either . the meat and roll were easier to chew digest than pat ' s , but the overall flavor was lacking ! basically , more money down the drain . i also didn ' t understand at both locations , why they rush you to order the sandwich and then direct you to another window to wait in line to order fries drinks while the sandwich gets colder ! my advice to anyone wanting to try a cheesesteak at either location is to bring your own homemade steak-um sandwich and pay the N for the roll to feed the pigeons ! 
i would describe the atmosphere , service and food as casual-yet-sophisticated . we had a large party and staff was so gracious and accommodating . yummy food . scrumptious meatball apps and elevated pizza . highly recommended for a casual dinner or getting together with a group of friends - a real crowd pleaser . 
 - extra points for having a live dj playing the funky beats - the pomegranate rickey and mint lemonade well very well made and put together , as if they were swanky cocktail beverages - the rickey slight gets the edge - french toast was delicious in every way - the serving size is pretty big - i liked the funky diner decor - the wife liked the brussels sprouts hash , i joyed the bacon part - her dish was pretty hearty as well - waiters and host were pretty friendly - - bacon is N the bacon i received was not N worthy , neither in taste , nor amount
been here a couple times and wasnt on yelp so decided to write a most recent review . the stuffed mushrooms were an excellent appetizer . good for dunking bread into . i had the grilled pork chop and it was one of the best i had . was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked . i must say every time i been here food was good . guess that why we go back . my girlfriend loves his salmon dish that was a special and hopes everytime we go back its on the menu . 
this was just a-ok . i thought the cocktails were pricey for this area ( N ? ) especially since you had to trek all the way up there from the morgan stop . they have a nice spacious backyard which would be great during warmer months . bartender was friendly . crowd becomes very hipster later in the night ( which is a con for me ) i ' d still go back . 
great burgers had the beef but my bf had the turkey , nice spot to get a drink . . . i love their salad and i think i just had the best mac and cheese here . . . 
simple and accommodating . so many menu and confusing at the first time . after few visit i notice the baguette to toasty and dry , sometime to chewy and other time is perfect also on the meat and veggie portion is changing from time to time overall its good . i love bulgogi with plenty jalapeno
llama tooth has one of the best outdoor dining spaces i ' ve spent time in in philly . at night , when seated on the patio , strings of lights flow across the table umbrellas and it ' s really a relaxing and fun setting to be enjoying your food and drink . this place has a great atmosphere inside and out , as the indoor dining room has a real cozy yet elegant feel to it . i had the ahi tuna and i can ' t stress enough how perfectly crafted this dish was . i was thoroughly satisfied . also of note , the beer list is quite extensive and features notable brews from around the u . s . as well as real local gems . impressive to say the least . craft lovers take notice ! this is definitely a place not to be missed . 
great atmosphere for a relaxing , intimate date . terrific food from the pre-appetizer bread ( cheese bread included ) to the appetizers and main course . i would recommend the sampler appetizers , you get a chicken , beef and cheese ball . the steak was cooked to perfection and the juice flowed to drench the delicious mashed potatoes . amazing place for a solid date night . 
N . N stars . came with friends last night for the N-course chef ' s choice menu . while i didn ' t even really take a look at the menu , there were a few things our friend wanted to try , and the waitress asked us if there was anything we wanted to make sure we had . service was good throughout , and the wine list and cocktails were great . my favorite courses were the sliders , the scallops and the bacon donuts . really though - i would come back for the sliders alone . they were truly unreal . i ' m not giving it N stars for a few reasons . first , when we checked in , the guy at the door was a bit rude . some of the plates were really hard to split between a few people . but mostly , the courses came so quickly , one after another , often N or N at a time . there wasn ' t enough time to savor the taste or talk about a dish before the plate was grabbed and replaced with another . in order to make it more of an experience , it would be great if the courses were spaced out just a bit . but overall , great food for the price and a great evening out . 
this place is the best . a great byob that has awesome food and good servers . i acutally met the owner cook , we told her the sauce on the appetizer was awesome and she actually brought us up a quart to take with us ! ! i highly recommend you try it . 
we were just there on N N N for the phillies game and i had read reviews on this place and we were not disappointed ! ! it was a great little place to have some bar food and beers before the game . i am from the south and every time i come to philly i am looking for the ultimate cheesesteak and all i had found were one ' s topped with " wiz " down south we use provolone so not a real fan of the wiz but at the tavern they cooked it just the way we wanted it and it was delicious ! ! ! ! i come once a year to see my phillies play and we will definitely be back ! ! thanks for the great food and service guys ! ! ! 
i ' m a big fan of chicken fingers , but was highly disappointed with this restaurant . i ordered N original fingers ( i had no idea how much i was getting ) and some of the idaho truffle fries to share with my sister . i ate N fingers and was pretty sick for the remainder of that night and the next morning . the chicken part was fresh- but it was so fried it was disgusting . also , both the fries and the chicken fingers had way too much oregano . and , it was overpriced . i wouldn ' t recommend this place . i gave this place N stars bc the delivery was fairly quick . 
came with my family to a restaurant new to our neighborhood . it was loud . hard to hear each other ' s conversation . we waited quite a while for our order ( we were six so that is understandable ) , but they definitely rushed us out . we waited for the food substantially longer than they gave us to eat--started clearing away dishes while we were still trying to enjoy our food . if they want return customers , allow them to partake of the experience and don ' t make them feel as if they ' re being rushed out . 
very good italian food with great service . i love the gnocchi , pasta dishes and the mussels are outstanding . 
i absolutely love lunitas ! always a great cup of coffee , and the pastries and snacks are delicious ! the staff is wonderful and super helpful . i ' m looking forward to all of the great things that this place has in store ! definitely stop by if you haven ' t already . 
i waver between N and N on westville , but i ' m bumping it up for N . my N would be because it ' s sorta overpriced , but that ' s ny . and my N is for a restaurant that emphasizes delicious seasonal veggies as much as westville does - and that ' s not usually ny . and i ' m very grateful for it . i ' m also very grateful for its new chelsea location that is much bigger than its other two homes . every day there ' s another list of seasonal veggies , you can get a plate for N for N and you can ' t go wrong . the restaurant is packed and loud , but the staff is friendly and handle the crowds well . still , i ' d get there early unless you want to wait . if you ' re sick of your mom telling you to eat your veggies , westville ' s a great place to make good on that promise . 
i loooooove this place . N . the food is great . they use local , seasonal and often organic food , and so their menu constantly changes to reflect what is available . the combinations of ingredients are innovative and unexpected . N . nice wine list with a variety of prices . N . friendly , funny and helpful staff . they will honestly direct you to a good selection of dish or wine pairing ( not just the most expensive option ) . N . atmosphere is super cozy and comfortable , outside or inside . you should go here . it is such a great restaurant . 
ate hear for a quick snack around Npm the day before new years eve N ! i stumbled in after seeing grimaldi ' s had a line around the block . i had the pizza with arugula and prosciutto , it was amazing ! ! ! ! the staff was very friendly . i must have got there right on time as i was leaving it was packed and also started forming their line around the block . get there early or be prepared to wait . worth it , these people know pizza ! ! 
amazing ! steak burrito guac . this is my go-to mexican place . they ' re quick , the place is always packed . i ' ve had a lot of different items from them and the quality is excellent and consistent . 
we visited trading post for our first time last night and will definitely be coming back . we arrived about a half hour before our reservation , and decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited . the bar is very long , with a ton of seating options . you can sit at surrounding high tops or at the bar itself . the bartender killian was very friendly , and allowed one of my family members to taste two different wines to make sure she was happy with her final selection . he also seemed very enthusiastic about the menu , which made us very excited to actually eat . we were sat by a very welcoming host anthony- who definitely made it his business to return to our table throughout our meal to ensure we were satisfied with our meal . we got the peck slip seafood appetizer which was perfect to share for N people and the shrimp was huge . very good deal for the amount and quality you receive . each of us was very happy with our main entrees the scallop special was especially note-worthy . our server was also very attentive and kept the table clean throughout the meal . a little tip- we were sat in an area called the nook or the snug , i cant remember the exact name . but if you have a small business meeting or an intimate group of friends , i would definitely recommend trying to reserve this space . very nice old school ny d cor , great service , and a fun location along the seaport . worth the trip ! 
this place has a nice ambiance and inside looks really good . tables are very close to each other but that ' s a general problem in restaurants who wants to utilize every inch . other than that there is not much good to say about rustica . service is very slow and waitress was very rude . food was average at best and pricey . not recommend this place . there are better options in montclair and surrounding towns . 
c ' est un tr s bon restaurant de greenwich village , moins d contract et jeune que le risotteria , mais les plats sont vraiment tr s bon et rel vent plus de la gastronomie ( faible portion mais merveilleuse qualit ) . je recommande ce restaurant pour les amateurs de plats fins italiens pour une client le un peu plus l gante . le d ner au bar reste toutefois assez diff rent et sympathique . 
the decor is beyond gorgeous . there are beautiful flowers everywhere , heaven . just thought the food was overpriced , the portions were a tad small . 
food was ok , atmosphere was awesome ! N for N people to have a pizza and N beer each ? 
as a vegetarian i only get to enjoy the aromas of some of the city ' s best burger joints , here i get to enjoy my favorite veggie burger . the veggie cake sandwich , to be exact , is paired with a mound of sweet potato and regular french fries , it ' s glorious . always good beers on draft , and the entire staff strive to keep it a low-key fun bar . " don ' t stop believing " will get vetoed on the jukebox to keep the local popped collar crowd from taking over . always recommend this place , but seating is limited so expect to wait at peak times . lunch is my favorite time to go . 
awesome place to eat . they have been featured on food network for their fried burgers , which were awesome , but we had the best mussels we ' ve ever had there too , along with awesome pulled-pork filled perogies . cozy off the beaten path , this place is a gem . it was not crowded , locals only in there . staff was friendly , attentive and excited about the food . they grow and make their own everything , all organic ingredients . bathroom was clean too , an added bonus ! 
best street meat in ny , hands down - and trust me , i know my street meat . i have yet to try the lamp or beef , because every time i come here the chicken looks and smells so divine ( maybe next time ! ) the cheerful cooks and free falafel makes standing in line go by fast . p . s . go easy on the hot sauce - it ' s seriously hot . 
when i think of korean food , bcd tofu house is what strikes me and for obvious reasons . come here famished , ' cos they offer you more than you order . yes , i ' m referring to the banchan - small plates of appetizers . in case you didn ' t know , banchan is free ! it has a good mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian appetizers with the standard - kimchi , something green ( kale or spinach or broccoli ) , bean sprouts , pickles , a non-veg item ( has been different each time ) and fried fish ( mackerel ) . love the fish , but beware of the bones . what ' s good ? soondubu ' s the best . it ' s a soft tofu soup that comes with rice on the side . they also give a raw egg you add to the piping hot soup and let it cook on it ' s own while you ' re busy munching on the free appetizers . seafood soondubu ( with shrimp , clams and mussels ) is flavorful and my most favorite dish here . for vegetarians , bibimbap is a tasty , healthy option . you can also opt for any of the tofu soups without the meat and they ' ll customize it for you . don ' t hesitate to ask for a take out box for the left over soup . they are extremely courteous and more than happy to see you not waste food . it ' s a filling , rather sumptuous meal for cheap . huge place , lots of seating , but there ' s still a N-N min wait . don ' t get bogged down by the wait , believe me , it ' s worth it ! 
we ( as a family ) frequent the place quite often . we meet friends and family alike , food is delicious , fresh , and very tasty . i ' m not one to give all the credit however , lou has done a fantastic job , we enjoy and expect to enjoy for years to come . ! ! ! bring on the garlic knots . . . . 
we ordered on grubhub . it took over an hour for them to make it about a mile and a half to our apartment . then when we got it the order was wrong . people who work at a deli should know what a roast beef special looks like . here ' s a hint it has russian dressing and coleslaw on it . i paid N . N for a dry roast beef sandwich . would not order again . 
this is one of our favorite pizza places in the city , and we ' re just thrilled that it opened up . we ' ve been there several times now , both eaten in and taken out . i have found that a lot of pizza places in philadelphia have not mastered the nuances of crust , but the crust of little italy ' s pizza is perfectly thin and crispy while retaining enough doughy-ness to fall ideally between thick doughy and hard crunchy . you can also tell that the cheese is of good quality and not something cheap out of a ten pound plastic bag . in addition to pizza they do your regular non-pizza pizza joint stuff stromboli , pasta , hoagies and cheesesteaks . the stromboli are huge , a really good size for the price , and the hoagies are served on nice traditional sesame seed rolls . among our favorites have been the stuffed spinach roll and the cheese steak wrap . all three stromboli options ( italian , cheesesteak and veggie ) have all been delicious . also , a must try is the eggplant or eggplant and zucchini pizza , something i never though i ' d like but ended up loving as has everyone else i ' ve been with who has tried it ! 
my husband and i recently moved to vermont from ri . we have been vegetarians for over N years . the meals that each of us had at revolution kitchen was the best vegetarian restaurant meal that either of us had had anywhere in the us . the food is gourmet with flavors that are unique and absolutely incredible ! ! amazingly , this is the only true vegetarian restaurant in burlington . i cannot give enough praise for the wonderful meals . janet
party of N , N tuna , N chicken , N steak all excellent . great service , friendly staff . 
the thai peanut chicken wrap is great , as is the teriyaki chicken . i haven ' t tried others , but i keep eating those two . most recent experience it was cinco de mayo , my friend and i didn ' t make reservations anywhere , and it was too late to get a spot in any of the traditional ' cinco ' places ( think jose pistolas , starr hangouts , etc . ) , so we walked by the wrap shack , saw there was a bar , and that their chalkboard said something about margaritas , and we said hey , ' lets do this ' we got the traditional margarita pitcher , some delicious sweet potato fries , and had a nice long chat . the waitress was friendly , and we had a super time . ( i usually just get delivery , but if i have the time some friends are around , i ' ll definitely pop in here again to hang out ) 
every time i visit home , this is the place that i want to go the most delicious , fresh noodles with awesome flavors , and so affordable ! i always have the hand drawn noodles with soy meat sauce and it never disappoints . N for what ' s definitely two meals worth of food ( but which i always eat in one anyways ) ? so worth it . 
this is my new favorite spot . it ' s got a cozy feel but also a cool feel as if you ' re at a hip spot without it being too pretentious . the pressed sandwiches are delicious and they always have yummy soups . they even have a half sandwich and soup or salad combo . if it ' s not crowded , it ' s the perfect spot to bring your laptop . definitely check it out ! 
this place was good , but line-outside-the-door-down-the-street-good ? definitely not . i have no idea why this place has so much hype on yelp . it ' s definitely average new york brunch quality . i was lucky to get seated right away ( hence avoiding the aforementioned line outside ) . seating is cramped- the servers can barely get to the tables it ' s so packed . basically you bump into your neighbors every time you get up from your seat . the " prixe fix " menu is a joke . you get a glass of orange juice ( that ' s been sitting on the table already ) and coffee with your entree . that ' s not a prixe fix meal- just an excuse to charge N . N per menu item . oh , and don ' t even think about substitutions . i had a chocolate croissant , which was a bit hard and the salmon sandwich . sandwich came out luke-warm with potatoes ( and way too much onion ) on the side . the decor has a cool ship cabin vibe , and service was fine ( though impatient ) . but what is all the hype about ? this is not a " hidden west village gem " , rather , an average , overinflated brunch spot- among countless offerings in the neighborhood . also , if you don ' t decide to take my word on it , fyi the place is cash only . 
yum ! get the red sangria , the patitos , ceviche , and any arepa . i was stuffed after a taste from four apps and less than a full arepa . . . so pretty good bang for your buck ! 
devil ' s alley bar grill makes my favorite burger . it comes with N huge onion rings and fries . i always go with the sweet potato fries , which are delicious . if you are gonna do brunch , you should go with shrimp and grits . i love the warm apple cider , but my company went with the beer . certainly not an extensive beer collection , but he left full and tipsy . 
my favorite place to go . i ' m desperately in love with the hanger steak with cab glaze . the staff is always super friendly and helpful and the wine list is great . love the glass mountains . 
the ambiance and energy is great . especially sitting outside in the summer . the staff is nice but they push the ( high margin ) drinks aggressively . there ' s a little attitude and the speed of the course services was spotty for us . we got the ( tiny ) app faster than a chinatown dive and then waited at least N minutes for our ( also tiny ) entrees . desert was perfect . i would say marc forge is a great place to go if you ' re not really hungry or on an expense account or both . blue ribbon bakery is the perfect execution of the same concept , sans outdoor seating . 
okay i have to be honest i came here when it was empty , and the service was great . i do have to admit the number of choices to create your own burger is very confusing to people , but i loved being able to customize everything down to the kind of toppings . i don ' t know why so many people have complained the burger patty was on point when i asked for it to be done medium . the drinks selection is amazing and the adult milkshake are brilliant . i hope more people see this place for what it is . 
nice place for private birthday party . nice vibe and amazing food . should try the monkey bread
poor customer service . i called on a thursday to find out if i could make reservations for the following day , friday , for N people . i was told they don ' t take reservations it ' s a first come first serve basis . i asked if it would be a problem with N people and was told depending on the time it may be a bit of a wait . something i was expecting . i got there at N N on friday and went to sign in , expecting to wait . when i approached the hostess i was told they don ' t seat parties greater then N . . . . . really ? ! ? ! i had called the day before and explicitly asked . . . . happy birthday to me . . . . had to make make other plans last minute and call all my guests with the venue change . . . . 
amazing ramen per usual ! i am ramen obsessed and ippudo is one of my favorite ramen joints in thee entire country ! this location was closer to our hotel , so we decided to eat here instead of the one in east village . we didn ' t have to wait at all since we arrived at around Nam on a friday . however , N minutes in and the place was packed ! ordered the pork hirata buns to share and for myself , the akamaru modern w nitamago . simply divine , can ' t wait to come back the next time i visit ! 
i never thought i would find a funkadelic french bistro , but alas i find myself saying i wish there were more funkadelic french bistros in the world especially in denver . french food is always our go to cuisine for a great meal and amelie hit the spot perfectly . amelie offers classic french food with a modern atmosphere and N ' s music filling the space . throughout the meal i found myself singing along with the music and doing my very best donna summer impression . hh is definitely where to start at amelie . hh is served in the entire dining room and worth a look before ordering off the main menu . everything sounds delectable and we wanted to taste a little bit of everything so we ordered more appetizers and shared an entr e . bruschetta - goat cheese and roasted red peppers ( from hh menu ) mussels with white wine and butter escargot in garlic butter ( from hh menu ) duck confit with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms basket of french bread wine flights ( from hh menu ) the bruschetta was forgettable and if dining at amelie again i would forgo the bruschetta and have two orders of the escargot . the escargot were buttery garlic flavor bombs served piping hot . the crusty french bread was needed so i could soak every last drop of garlic butter and savor my love of butter . the mussels were prepared with white wine , fennel , and garlic and were as addictive as ever . we were served a heaping pile of mussels ( more than enough for two ) that were plump and delicious and disappeared as quickly as they arrived . the duck confit was a show stopper . everything on the plate was divine , from the crispy duck skin ( aka - crack ) , the bite size fingerling potatoes , and the earthy mushrooms . i could have easily licked the plate clean but opted to be a lady instead . next time i ' ll be licking the plate , so when you see someone picking up a plate and licking every last morsel of tasty goodness you ' ll know it ' s me ( come say hi ) . amelie has a modern french romance vibe and is a wonderful dining destination for couples . the front of the restaurant can be lively and loud so i would request a seat in the back for a more intimate dining experience . reservations are recommended if not required if you want to be seated for dinner . from the atmosphere to the food this funkadelic french bistro is deliciously trendy and only becomes more mouthwatering as donna summer plays in the background . . . last dance last chance for love yes , it ' s my last chance for romance tonight i need you by me beside me , to guide me to hold me , to scold me ' cause when i ' m bad i ' m so , so bad so let ' s dance the last dance let ' s dance the last dance let ' s dance this last dance tonight
i ' ve become very picky with my street meat as more halal trucks have opened up in the city but this is the halal spot as everyone claims . i went last night for the first time ever and to our luck , the line was short and the wait was less than N minutes . i noticed it was N and while it ' s cheap , i initially thought it was a bit overpriced for halal . my usual go to is rafiqi ' s and their chicken over rice is N . N . but little did i know that these guys on Nrd hook you up in portions . as soon as i ordered , the food was in my hands . according to my friend , his theory why this place is so good is because you ' re normally drunk and two , they have so many customers that their meats are always fresh and juicy . i think he may be onto something . the sauces here are all self serve . make sure to get a good amount of white sauce but don ' t oversauce . and beware of the hot sauce . yes , they provide a warning and of course you think you can handle hot but their sauce is extremely hot . 
this place has become my go to for high quality japanese food in williamsburg . the place itself is pretty spacious and has a rustic feel with lots and lots of grey wood . it has big community tables in the middle of the dining room floor and booths along the walls . a small waiting area is in the back as they will only seat you if you have your full party . as far as udon goes - the spicy bukkake udon tastes like udon spaghetti with bolognese . the broth - so good . a nice poached egg comes on the side to add in to your bowl and adds creaminess . trust me , sounds weird but it works so , so well . - the pork belly udon ( the special ) is also a consistently great option - the pork belly has nice bit of fat which is luscious and melts on your tongue . other things - the taco set , N different preset rolls , uses great quality fish and tastes magnificently fresh . three pre-mixed soy sauce combinations come along soy , mild , spicy . - agedashi tofu is a must for tofu lovers . fried perfectly and sitting in a delicious soup . great great great ! even my gf who is not a tofu lover appreciates it . thing that i would pass on - shrimp special , a couple of grilled shrimp with sea salt on skewers . shrimp special not so special . - edamame - well its edamame . overall , i really really really like this place . i ' ve only experienced good , courteous service and the food is great . 
this is an amazing neighborhood gem- trendy decoration , friendly staff , and delicious thai food ! this is exactly what ues needs - an above standard thai restaurant . lunch special is mostly N and N , and only duck for N . a lunch set comes with an appetizer , an entree and soup or salad . for appetizer , the net-rolls are crispy and tasty , dumplings look like hand-made and tasted very good . for entree , we have tried beef pad thai , beef pad se-ew , and chicken red curry . all were satisfying . entree comes with good quantity and much less greasy than most of the americanized thai restaurants in the city . thai ice tea is just about right , rich but not too sweet . 
this is a second review during a group dinner in chinatown my friend mentioned this spot ( raving about it ) so ofc i had to put in my two cents . so my other friends decided to come here too and i went again ( yay ) ! this time we went with a group of six and so were able to try more things in the menu . everything we ordered was devoured . my female friend wanted to lick her plate clean . the waiter was friendly . the only thing i wasbt crazy about was the green tea miso ? ice cream lol . it was too eclectic for me but maybe thats my problem . anyway , the meal was so awesome my friend decide to treat the whole group ! he surely must have been impressed . 
more like N . N stars . i treated my family here on our last night in nyc . i chose this place because of the reviews for the other location , but since we were nearer to this one , we came here instead . first off , atmosphere was rocking ! everyone was dressed up and looking amazing . the ambiance was a little more upscale , and we walked in here grungy and tired . there was some snotty people looking at us , but i didn ' t care . we walked in after N hours of running around nyc , and were in wrinkled travel clothes . if we offended your sensibilities , then don ' t look at us . we ordered wings for the appetizers and i thought it was decent . but you only get three per order , so we had to put in a couple orders , which is probably the most i ever paid for wings ( my big bro is a wing fanatic ) . we each ordered a different ramen , so we can taste each others . there is only N types to order . then we chose different various toppings according to what our server recommended for each ramen . i thought everything was delicious . so did my family . i especially enjoyed the braised pork belly topping . the broth was hot and fresh , and very tasty . the service was awesome . he was attentive without being too intrusive . it was most likely his recommendations that made my ramen extra tasty . okay now the sticker shock for wings and bowls of soup . . . wow . i mean i knew what i was getting into , but still ! this place was very , very expensive for what you get . oh well , at least i enjoyed it ! N . N stars . i rounded up to four because our server was great , and his recommendations were spot on . N stars for service , N stars for atmosphere and food , and N stars for price . i do not know if i will be back . 
the best restaurant in brooklyn . it ' s hard to get a reservation , but it ' s possible . food was excellent , service was flawless . they expedite the food perfectly . want to come back again , but not soon . . . . . . b c it ' s expensive . 
had dinner there last night and there were N of us . below was what we ordered N ) jamon iberico- enjoyed this very much N ) patatas brava - this was my least liked dish N ) gambas shrimp- pretty good N ) crispy artichoke - loved it and interestingly paired with beets N ) grilled octopus- was alright . prefer this dish in bocqueria N ) bershire pork belly- was just ok nothing special N ) crispy quail- i liked it but the rest thought it was just a tad too sweet N ) crispy vermicelli- this was my fav dish of the night N ) grilled razor clams- was tasty and juicy . loved it N ) paella- by the time this came , we were all in food coma ! i liked the seafood as it was very fresh and you can taste the sweetness of the seafood in the sauce . however the rice was a tad soggy . ambience was great as other reviewers mentioned . 
let me get this out of the way . i am a tourist and i hate times square . but my sister works around the corner , so i always grab a slice of cheesecake when i meet her up . i have yet to eat at the restaurant , but i always take my slice to go . i would hate to get home and not have dessert , after all . the red velvet is awesome , and i had the chocolate mousse on my last visit . lactose intolerance be damned , but that was awesome . it is a layer of cheesecake with a layer of mousse - each layer being as big as a regular slice of cake . the slices are as big as your face and perfect for sharing . i am a sucker for this place . 
after having indonesian food , i saw this place was rated N stars after N reviews . i had to stop in and grab N dumplings for N . N . i was watching the man behind the glass making fresh noodles by hand when within N minute i received my lil post meal snack . the dumpling skins were thin , crispy like gyoza but they were stuffed as big as dumplings . i wasn ' t disappointed at all . i will be back to try the hand drawn noodles . 
dinner on monday , july N . we were seated immediately , and the ambience is very pleasant . for once you don ' t have to shout to be heard , the seats are comfortable and the table spacing is generous so that your conversation is not overheard . service is well-meaning and largely efficient , but water glasses go unfilled , extra bread isn ' t offered ( so we asked ) and too many of the menu items require long , involved explanations that can leave you reeling about what you ' re actually ordering . i ordered a bombay gimlet to start this is a simple drink , nothing but bombay gin and rose ' s lime juice . except here . they serve " their version , " which is very little gin and fresh lime juice over-sweetened with simple syrup . i don ' t mind a restaurant creating new cocktails and being inventive , but when you order a standard ( martini , manhattan , gimlet ) how about getting the real thing instead of some bartender ' s creative take on it . and tell the customer what he ' s getting before putting in the order . N . a simple salad with vinaigrette dressing runs N . the " uovo " appetizer is described perfectly by jonathan h . , below . essentially , it is sweetbreads and lobster ( not a lot of each ) completely inundated by foam , sort of like fishing around in your kitchen sink after spiking the water with detergent . the tastes are fine , but the tactile sensation leaves something to be desired -- not the umami i think they were after . this app runs N . spaghetti with blue crab , lemon , bottarga , chiles ok , but not memorable . stay away if you don ' t like spicy food . halibut a small rectangle of fresh fish fillet , almost unseasoned , cooked almost too much so that it bordered on being dry , with a small melange of vegetables on the side as well as an even smaller portion of bland polenta . for N the halibut should be ethereal . clearly , they haven ' t heard of sous-vide . we skipped desserts and coffee . the tab with tax and tip was just under N . i can think of ten other restaurants with better food for the money , although not with surroundings this civilized . 
per their menu apparently they were previously at N broome but currently they ' re next to vanessa others at same address ( Nb specifically ) . scored an order of excellent N noodles in peanut butter sauce but skipped the dumplings . enjoyed it by the window in the shabby space and doused each bite with various sauces on offer . 
i visited soco on a rainy june night to have dinner with a friend . we had been looking forward to dinner there all week . the space has a chill vibe and a modern minimalist decor , the staff was very friendly and gave suggestions on everything from drinks to desert . two cocktails to try when visiting are darn i forgot the names but they were tasty . we each had an order of the famous red velvet waffles and chicken the chicken was moist and tender and the waffle was soft and tasty i do wish the chicken had been drained more i did not like the oil from the chicken on my waffle , i was so relieved to get maple syrup if it had been aunt jemimah i would have got up and left i don ' t play that game . the kitchen was about to close but we called over the waitress for one last thing the lobster and shrimp cheesy grits to share and N passion fruit creme brulles please and thank you . 
overall the food is very good and the drinks as well . the staff is very good too . i remember being greeded by nichole whom may be the manager . i only say this because she is knowledgeable , professionable , and friendly . well if if she is not the manager she should be , anyway i enjoyed my visit because of her and the other employees . 
worthy byo joint . great latin flavors . oxtail stew was phenomenal . st patty ' s day beef stew with dumplings are to die for . friendly staff and good ambience . bring a date or make it a casual dinner spot with friends and fam . i ' m sold . 
i do have mixed feelings about this place . while it has a unique idea and healthy food options , i feel like the menu is too much , the wait is too long ( even if there aren ' t very many people in front of you ) and the food i had just mediocre at best . my husband had come here for lunch and had a veggie burger and said it was the best he has ever had so i was excited to try ( we are not vegetarian or vegan , just change it up every once in a while ) . we came one evening maybe Npm or so and only a handful of people in front of us . i ordered the veggie burger and built up some anticipation as we were waiting ( they deliver the food to your table but have to order up at the counter ) , our food arrived and i dug in ! ! first bite until the last i had to choke it down . i did not find it very enjoyable at all and that was so upsetting . the pasta salad that came on the side was very very tasty . i do plan on coming back because with all of the options i ' m bound to find a goodie ! 
this restaurant has taken an ugly abandoned lot between two beautiful murals and made an incredible restaurant setting . the food is very good and the beer list is unique and very tasty and the mimosas are fine . join the e mail list and get a free drink . we sat out on patio area today in philadelphia and it was beautiful . 
my bf and i were in ny last weekend and wanted to find a good brunch place . we had no idea where to go so we randomly selected jane because of all the great reviews we ' ve read about this restaurant . i ' d have to say we made a very good choice ! at first we were running late and didn ' t think we ' d make our reservation . we arrived N min late and thank goodness we were still able to get a table . definitely make reservations ! the restaurant was jam packed . . . there were tons of people waiting to be seated . i ' m so glad we made reservations or else we probably would ' ve waited at least N min . now on to the good part . . . the food . my bf ordered the lobster benny ( maine lobster , poached eggs , buttermilk biscuits , spinach , hollandaise ) and i ordered the benedict jane ( poached eggs , crab and crawfish cakes , spinach , tarragon hollandaise ) . both were delicious ! they were both well prepared and the poached eggs were perfect . the biscuits in the benny were so good . . . so buttery and flaky . . . mmm . we also ordered a side of chicken apple sausage . the sausage was ok . . . not the best i ' ve had . it lacked a bit of flavor so we weren ' t too impressed w it . the prices range from N- N , which is a bit higher than what you would normally pay for brunch food , but it ' s well worth it . you also get a complimentary cocktail or juice with your meal , which is nice . the service was great . the waiters waitresses there are very fast and efficient . we were in and out of there in less than and hour . when we left it was almost N Npm and there was still a long line at the door . crazy . if you ' re looking for a good brunch place in ny . . . i highly recommend jane ! i ' m definitely going back the next time i ' m in ny . 
village whiskey is solid for a burger or veg burger . fries are great though a bit salty . service is sharp for the most part . i dont know , something about it isn ' t blowing me away but we do tend to go back for office lunches . i think part of the problem is not venturing to far out on the menu , but that ' s how lunch can be . it ' s solid and won ' t surprise you for better or worse . lots of folks will come here b c of the garces name . . . i think it could be a tad more engaging with that as the backdrop ( pressure to impress ) 
went a second time tonight , after an early movie . . really love it . friendly service , would love to eat it all but there is only so much room in my tummy ! ! ! spreading the word on my fb page . considering catering at some point . i am a big fan ! 
wow , what a disaster is all i can say . went to this place based on the reviews , and frankly they must all be plants because this place was horrible . been to many korean restaurants here in new york , and around the world , even have lived in korea for N years and this is the worst experience i have ever had . the beef bulkogi was almost flavorless , frankly i have never had worse . the pork bulkogi was pretty tasty . the soup that came with it was good though . but , the service was horrendous . the waitress brought us our meat and unceremoniously dumped the beef on the grill turned around and never returned . we had to spread it out and cook it ourselves , when it was time to cook the pork we also had to do this ourselves , no big deal but we ran out of all of our side dishes , water , dipping sauce and lettuce by the time we finished the beef . it was just my son and i and we ordered N barbeque entrees and N appetizers , you would think we could have had our water glasses refilled . the restaurant was almost deserted so it wasn ' t that they were too busy . speaking about the side dishes , the kimchi was not good , and all of the other sides ranged from good to not so much . please never go to this place as it is a ripoff with horrible service and poor food . many many better places to eat korean bbq in new york
i almost hate writing a review , because this place is a real treasure that i would love to keep to myself . but that said , la slowteria is a new gem in the neighborhood and is worthy of being known as the best in its kind . the food , the atmosphere , the service- everything felt as an extension of my own home , if only my cooking was anywhere close to hugo ' s creations . i have celebrated my birthday there and i have to say , so far it is the most memorable experience i have ever had . 
i come here often , the food is very good and plentiful . the waiters and waitresses are very nice . a very nice place for a good meal . 
good food and cheap . N out N meals were good . congee with duck is great . 
we had the tasting menu lunch on may Nth . lovely restaurant , excellent service , and the food was good . minor complaints N . dining room was chilly . N . N servings of ice cream were served in a row -- a lychee sherbet , a small serving of wheat flavored ice cream , then ice cream served with the " main " desert course of either chocolate or pear cake . i like ice cream but . . . . N . weak " coffee shop " served -- undrinkable . maybe the expresso is better . 
i ' ve given this place too many chances . whenever i use my debit card there , when i check my account it turns out they charged me like N more than what it was at the store . a few weeks ago , one guy who works there sneezed on his hand , picked up the slice of pizza i wanted with that hand , and did not wash his hands before that . recently , my friend and i used a coupon there , and they charged us double instead . it makes me mad because the food is not bad . they need new people working there , or someone to teac them to wash their hands . 
i have been coming here for N years now . they are always consistently good . my wife and i were in on a recent friday night . we placed our orders and somehow our order got misplaced . no worries . i was drinking a N oz belgian beer which was divine . when the floor manager realized our ordered was delayed , he sent my wife and i each a glass of champagne . nice touch ! ! ! i had the steak frites . i can ' t describe how good it was . once again just a great meal and very pleasurable evening ! 
this place is such a hidden gem ! beautiful ambiance , friendly kind staff and the food is simply delicious ! made rsvps after reading the ny times review and must say that we had to wait a few minutes to be seated , so be prepared to be a bit patient but this restaurant is definitely worth the wait and they hype ! from start to finish salinas delivers , we will definitely be back again ! 
great view , great food and the staff is very kind and helpful ! 
nice wine bar near barclays center . great happy hour deals , especially with their N cocktails . we had N here while waiting for the jay-z coldplay nye concert . forget what they ' re called ( only remembered the james and the giant peach and some cucumber one ) , but hey if we had half of what they sell in terms of cocktails and liked them , the chances of you liking something there is in your favor . the only unfortunate thing is that we ordered the mac and cheese and it took too long to come out . it came out a few minutes after we had to cancel the dish as we were running behind schedule for the concert waiting for the dish . it looked yummy , but we shall try it next time once we are back in the area and have time to kill . 
really good place to have casual dinner or just a couple of drinks . the food is delicious ! try grilled octopus or lobster salad - yumm ! ! ! definitely recommend this place for couples and small parties . 
definitely a hip atmosphere , and the food is ok . but if you ' ve already paid homage , and want much better food for a much better price try la brique around the corner on manhattan ave . don ' t let the dorky atmosphere fool you , the food is amazing , and they have a nice outside deck in the summer . everything we ' ve had has been great , but get the lamb chops or filet minion . . . . as good as anywhere , and half the price . 
food is fresh and delicious . service excellent . restaurant is elegant and comfortable . price is very reasonable . i will come here for sure next time i am in town . 
great spot for brunch ! big groups ! beautiful ambiance , generous food helpings , and bottomless brunch options make it a nice option ! 
stopped in with my boyfriend for a late night burger since we were in the area and it ' s rumored to have one of the best burgers in the city . the place was pretty empty . we ordered a bistro burger , medium rare with fries and two small beers . the beers here are quite inexpensive . the burger was juicy . came with onion , lettuce , tomato , pickles , and bacon . overall a good burger . would come again if in the area . 
empenadas were delicious and the cuban sandwich was as good as it gets . great open space , very refreshing-- plenty of space to just enjoy the " space " . we sat at the bar . the bartender lady ( with the hat ) was very professional but super nice at the same time . i really enjoyed this place--not a bad thing to say about it . the band was just starting as we were leaving- next time i ' ll be sure to stay . 
i get delivery from gandhi at least once a week , and it is always fantastic . today i brought a few of my friends to eat in the restaurant . it was amazing . the service was excellent , the food was even better without the short lag between preparation and delivery , and they threw in a few freebies . three people ate until we were stuffed , but the bill only came to N , and we had leftovers . bottom line this is one of the best indian places i ' ve ever been to . 
wonderful breakfast . fun atmosphere . good for kids . fast , attentive service . will be back ! ! 
awesome place for brunch . great food with actual flavor . service was awesome . prices were very reasonable . loved this place .

wheelers is one of my favorite places to eat . i have been going there since they opened . the ingredients are ordered from local farms and markets in the highest standard of organic quality , i regularly order double meals and never feel sleepy after . currently they don ' t have a liquor license , but they are working on it . their meats , poultry , and seafood are raised free ranged , fed grass and grains not corn , and they are treated with respect . the vegetables are naturally grown without pesticides or chemicals . these factors make for very satisfying and innovative meals well worth the price . and to top it off , the atmosphere is soothing , comfortable , and not crowded . and the staff is always friendly and open to constructive criticism . wheelers is definitely the delicious healthy choice in dining ! 
i came here before my flight to china last year for some real food before i ' m stuck with airplane food . my uncle worked here for many years and still does so we got a table really quick and food came out quick too . i wasn ' t sure what some of the dishes were since my uncle ordered but they were delicious . we had xiao long bao which was a soup dumpling . it was so great that we ordered another one . at the end , i had fried milk for the first time and it was awesome . they gave us a lot free drinks some pomegranate flavored in a bottle that i wasn ' t too fond of . great experience overall ! 
i ' m about to write a novela about this place so i ' ll get this out of the way i saw a mouse . he came out of the wood work - literally- and hung out at the ordering station closest to our table . no apologies or anything from our waiter . check please ! the restaurant was packed and we had no reservations , but luck was on our side and we were promptly seated at what was possibly the only open table in the house . nice ! the menu isn ' t vegetarian friendly although you can build an entree with appetizers and sides . if possible , they will prepare veg friendly versions of their meat-laced sides , like their much raved about ' mac and cheese ' . let ' s talk about their ' mac and cheese ' ? best ever ? hardly . actually , no . while tasty , in my opinion calling that dish mac and cheese is blasphemy . if it isn ' t made southern style , then it isn ' t mac and cheese . almond tries to reinvent the veritable comfort food , but did so unsuccessfully with their delivery of a cheesy penne dish instead . mac and cheese is one wheel that does not need reinventing . other items knoshed on artichoke with N dipping sauces - delicious english pea and lemon ravioli - meh polenta and marscarpone raviolini - my favorite ! the meat lovers had escargot , mussels , lobster raviolini . perhaps meat lovers would have a better experience at this place than veg heads . overall , i enjoyed the ambiance pre-mouse and my time spent with wonderful company more than the food . 
i think this place would have better reviews if the name vetri was not attached to it . take away all the vetri expectations and the place lives up to its intentions , which is a casual gastropub with great food . i loved it , and will definitely be back . bartenders were great , and the company surrounding the bar really gave you that cheers kinda feeling . 
i came here several years ago with a large group . i had heard of the restaurant prior to coming here and was eager to dine here . i was impressed . i had a lamb dish that was expertly prepared . as i recall , the salad i had was delicious ! this is a " trendy " type of place and i actually knew one of the waiters here . i like to try new places , so how frequently i would return i am not certain . i haven ' t yet . but i would welcome the chance to do so if provided the opportunity . service was good . we had a dining room off the main area and we were cramped . it looked as though the rest of the restaurant was equally cozy . 
i love everything about l b . the pizza , the people , the general brooklyn atmosphere . some of the best pizza ive ever had in my life . have yourself a square pizza and a coke and you will understand why i gave this place N stars . 
this place is loud and i was really concerned they were going to get our order wrong . the waitron asked us to hold our water glasses while she attempted to juggle a few other things . when we asked her for ice for the bucket , she forgot . when we placed our orders , she didn ' t hear us right . we finally flagged someone down to bring us some ice and fortunately , we got what we ordered . we split a really good spinach salad . i ordered the mussels and they were average . my friend got chicken scapiella and it was average . i think what i will always remember about this place was the noise level . it prepared us for the loud music we were going to hear later on at tierney ' s . 
classic ! 
i hadn ' t been to sabrina ' s in a couple years . i remembered it as this cute little cafe with lovely interior and delicious brunch food . which it still has . . . however , is it worth an over an hour wait ? not sure . when we put our names on the list , they said N-N minutes wait . ok . doable . plus they have a nice waiting room with coffee ( which , seriously , should be complimentary , but no ) . N minutes later , i ask how far we were down the list , and they answered another N-N minutes . . . N-minutes later , i asked again and still there was another N-N minutes wait . in the end , we waited for a good hour and N minutes which i wouldn ' t mind , had i known from the beginning . the food was good . not amazing . not delicious . just good . the pancakes were on the dry side and all three other dishes spicier than expected . portions are huge , but really i ' d rather have a smaller portion of really delicious food . not sure i ' ll go back anytime soon . there are other brunch places in this town that are higher on my list . 
my family and i visited the shanty for dinner a few weekends ago and it was fantastic ! we were greeted upon entering the building which is always nice and welcoming , our server was friendly and attentive . our sons ate from the kids menu , my husband who is not a seafood lover had the chicken teriyaki , the chicken was nice and juicy . i love seafood so i went with the broiled seafood combo with homemade mac cheese ! everything was awesome ! can ' t wait to get back to burlington to go again ! 
great breakfast and friendly staff . donuts are overrated . 
we were pleasantly surprised by rangoon ' s decor . from the outside it appears to be a h . i . t . w . but inside was clean and even a little bit fancy . the service was very friendly and fast , but that might be because the dining room was less than half full . hopefully it ' s the same on a busy night . . . we probably could have skipped the appetizers . we tried the crispy onions ( greasy ) , golden triangles or samoosa , and spring rolls ( both average ) . the thousand layer bread was good , but my husband thought the roti and curry sauce at penang was better . the entrees were much better . we ordered everything spicy and it was the perfect kind of spicy ( hot enough , but not too hot so you can ' t taste the food ) . my favorite dish that i want more of is the spicy curry chicken . it ' s cooked on the bone so it ' s extra tasty ( it ' s a little more work to eat though so don ' t order this if you ' re lazy ) . the menu is so vast and there is much more to try that i will definitely go back to rangoon for my burmese fix . 
amazing place , favorite coffee shop in new york . servers are so nice and attentive , coffee and espressos taste amazing , even the food is good and unique . close to the same price point as sbux but wayyyyy better . help keep them in business ! 
protip order the stuffed challah french toast not the challah french toast . the first option is loaded with seasonal delights . on the menu this past weekend , had you ordered the first option , you would have received N large slices of fat texas style challah french toast sliced in half and stuffed with peaches , a thick cream and sprinkled with almonds . had you ordered the later , you would have received four fat , dry pieces of texas style challah french toast with some blueberry sauce in a small condiment container in the middle . difference ? yes . the biscuits here are wonderful and buttery . they ' re crumbly like the red lobster biscuits , but sweeter like grandma ' s butter milk biscuits . i love it when bread falls apart on my plate . seriously . protip N don ' t order jam with your biscuit . it comes in a packet and says preservatives or smuckers or some crap like that . 
a friend of mine had just invited us to join them at this restaurant because it was just written up in the nytimes with a great review . to be honest with you traveling N minutes into what looked like a commercial district on a saturday night to get chinese food was not my idea of fun . we pulled into the parking lot of a strip mall and my expectations sunk even lower . the only thing i was looking forward to was spending the evening with some good friends . surprisingly when we stepped into this no frills venue it was packed and had to wait for a table . the staff was friendly and apologetic but we got seated shortly . . we ordered almost every dish in the times article and then some . we were all pleasantly surprised by the entire meal and all agreed that we would come back again soon . this time with a cork screw and wine glass , which were not provided . lol . i have to say i don ' t believe i have had better chinese food than this ! jane
this is so far my favorite brunch lunch spot in lic . on weekends , it ' s packed and they don ' t take reservations . but if you come here on a normal weekday , you get seated pretty quickly . i like that they have a semi-outdoor area in the back where you can get some natural sunlight in on a nice day . as far as food goes , it ' s consistently delicious . for brunch , i ' m a fan of their sausage and fried egg on a brioche bun . its monstrosity may appear intimidating but don ' t fear , it can only do good for your stomach . i also really enjoy their chicken salad sandwich on their lunch menu . sounds plain and simple but not many places cannot make a decent and mouth-watering chicken salad sandwich like they do . if you have room left in your stomach , grab one of their chocolate chip cookies to go and it will leave you with many sweet memories . price-wise , it ' s ridiculously reasonable given the portion sizes . no wonder this place is such a hit ! plus , service is always wonderful ! 
i picked this place out of reading terminal market by the line . i luckily showed up before i got too hungry , and i got in the longest line i saw . directly behind me were some police officers who assured me that the roast pork with spinach sauteed in garlic and provolone was the way to go . juicy , juicy roast pork . full of flavor , and the spinach and provolone complemented everything perfectly . had i not gotten an amazing philly cheesesteak for lunch the next day , this would have been the best sandwich i had in philly . i was happy as a clam . not cheap , but boy was it worth it ! 
based off of a recommendation , my friend and i stopped by for dinner on a saturday night . the ambiance was lively but not loud or crowded , and our server was prompt and friendly . the food was simply incredible . bold , rich flavors , nice balance of spice , wide range of menu options . burmese is this amazing combination of chinese and indian , and rangoon does it exceptionally well and at an affordable price . enjoy ! 
loved this place . nice ambiance for a date or dinner and drinks with friends . i came here N nights ago with girlfriends . we ordered N starters and entree to share . the bursts was excellent , hot chips with blue cheese were great , but my favorite was the pot of mussels which was in a white wine sauce . it was plenty of food for us N and of course we tried some of their specialty drinks ! ! would definitely come back . 
my family and i have been going to penny cluse for years , and it ' s a favorite . unfortunately , trillions of people know how good it is , so it ' s almost always crowded . we ' ve sometimes had to wait an hour for a table . in severe cases , we run over to border ' s and browse to fill the time ! my favorite thing is a white omelet with mushroom cilantro ( you can specify whatever fillings you want ) , a side of biscuits and another side of saut ed spinach . but eccentric items often turn up on the specials board , like trout or pumpkin bread french toast , and i try something new . i ' ve never been anything but delighted . no matter what you order , portions are large . 
good late night halal . hardly a banquet . 
we went to celebrate a friends birthday on friday . we had a large party of N and it took over a hour to accommodate us . since this place is small for large groups we had to be broken up in groups . they did accommodate us when N more people showed up . we were spread out amongst N tables with our table being the biggest of N . we had two waitresses one for our table and another for other three . quick observations were this place is more suited for couples N or more max . the other tables in our party received their food and drinks in decent amount of time . ours on the other hand took a long time to receive drinks . when we did inquire about them they informed us to be patient they were out of glassware . it eventually took N min to receive N mixed drinks . overall the food was good and they were nice size portions . i would eat here again but only if i went out with a party of N or less . 
this place is pretty solid for what it is . it ' s a specialty pizza place by the slice . the popular artichoke basil slice is very good . it ' s like eating artichoke cream soup with your pizza . it ' s very hearty and is great on a cold night . i also tried the crab pizza but wasn ' t as impressed with that slice . i may have been too full from the artichoke slice or maybe it just wasn ' t for me , but i might try it again . i still have to try the margharita slice that others have written about . definitley check this place out . 
my husband and i just moved to nj from nyc recently and have been on the hunt for good pizza in the area . we went to star tavern based on a recommendation and on all of the great yelp reviews . the place is super casual and noisy . a great place to bring kids . and there were a lot of kids in there . we got there around N . Npm on a friday and the line for a table was super long . we waited about N minutes but grabbed some beers at the bar which made the wait a little better . we just got the regular pie which was pretty decent . like other reviewers said , it was overly greasy for my taste , but it still tasted good . i definitely liked it , but i have to think that there is better pizza in the area . so we will continue our search . 
i cannot say enough about ofrenda ! ! ! i recommend it to anyone that will listen . i have celebrated birthdays there along with random days in the village and it never disappoints . jorge and the crew there make every dining experience fabulous . the drinks are insanely good and the food is delicious ! service is always top notch as well . the creativity they show always leave us saying wow . highly recommend to all ! ! can ' t way to go again over the holidays ! great location and if there ' s a line - just order one of there awesome cocktails while you wait - always worth it ! the ambiance and decor is also perfect - candlelight , cozy and warm ! ! 
i came as a party of N on a thursday night and had no problem sitting down . this place normally has N hour waits for brunch or even prime-time dinner , but it ' s worth waiting a bit and heading in after the rush . it has a very casual feel and N main dining room with a bar in the back , but it tends to get a bit loud . on nice days nights , they have the windows open to enjoy the beautiful sounds of the city as well . the service was friendly ( a bit of a wait between app and entr e ) , but otherwise fine . we did the crab cakes to start which were good ( N decent size to feed N N people ) . for entrees , we did the fish and chips ( slightly over-battered but good ) , the grilled cheese and artichoke which was unique and i will definitely try and replicate and the cheesesteak with peppers , mushrooms and onions which had a slightly toasted focaccia style bread which everyone really enjoyed . overall , all the food and experience was good and i will be back . buon appetito
good food
most people who live in and around south philadelphia don ' t get cheese steaks from here . it ' s for the out of townies who don ' t know better . i would rather walk down to underdog ' s and get two hot dogs , fries and a drink for under N , rather than paying almost N for this lousy steak . oh , and the people that work there suck too . 
there ' s truth to the belief that the east coast knows how to make pizza . i felt like julia roberts in eat , pray , love . and it was gluten free . best pizza i ' ve ever had . i ' m ruined . thank you , ann and tatum , for the great service ! 
cozy , high-end thai spot with lovely decor . great ambiance and delicious thai iced tea . you must get the thai iced tea ! ! i came here for a birthday dinner and the food was tasty ! starting off with appetizers the steamed mussels ( N ) were good . the chicken satay did not amaze me . the mango salad with crispy soft shell crab was delicious . it could use a little more crab though . as for entrees the upthai claypot fried rice ( N ) has a combination of scallops , shrimp , chicken and sweet chinese sausage ( lop churng ) . the shrimp were tiny ! they skimped out on the seafood , but gave a whole lot of chicken . after a few bites you ' ll get tired of it . i felt that the flavor and entire dish was overwhelming sweet . the rice and toppings were all drenched in the same thick , sweet sauce . i suggest sharing this dish rather than eating one claypot by yourself . i do recommend the kang ped pet yang ( N ) it ' s a crispy deboned duck with a mixture of bell pepper , basil , pineapple , and curry sauce . it was delectable ! 
in all the times i ' ve visited devil ' s den , i think i may have had the food one time . and honestly , i was already a few beers deep and can ' t really remember anything about it . so i ' m going to talk about their happy hour . what a great deal they have here ! monday through friday , from N to N , half priced draft beers . now at a generic bar that serves generic beer it may not be that exciting , but devil ' s den has one of the best beer selections around . each time i ' ve visited , i ' ve been able to try a new beer that was absolutely delicious . they also offer beer flights ( which i ' ve never sampled ) scene wise , it ' s a pretty chill atmosphere . i hate those happy hours where everyone ' s in a suit , and you feel like a bum if you went home and changed . you know those type of happy hours i am talking about ! the only bad thing is that the bar area tends to get a little crowded . there are tables on the wall across the bar and it makes it difficult to stand around-- we usually try to get there as early as possible to stake out bar stools . another nice thing about devil ' s den is that Nth street has a decent amount of street parking- if you are coming from work in your car , that is clutch . just don ' t drink and drive ! i ' m serious ! 
with N , N restaurants in nyc , why waste your time ? i can ' t say the food was bad . nor can i say the wine selection was bad . that said , i just don ' t understand why people consider these the best oysters in town . they simply aren ' t . the waitstaff is well-informed . alas , it ' s all they can do to not fall on top of you as they ' re forced to crowd more patrons onto the benches . while i love kraftwerk , it ' s also nice to be able to actually have a conversation with the person across the table ( literally impossible the night i went with the music so loud ) . this place would be great if a ) they didn ' t put the tables right on top of each other , b ) turned the music down just a tad , c ) the prices . . . really ? 
delicious and packed beautifully ( and the delivery guy came N minutes early ! ) . i ordered the N-hour flight east , which is sesame seared tuna and some veggies wrapped in lettuce leaves , with a lemongrass ginger dipping sauce . it came with some kind of relish and a little tasty piece of chocolate chip cookie . N for a sandwich is a bit pricey , but it was totally worth it for the quality of the food and the thought put into it . one star off because i was still hungry after , but i ' m a beast . looking forward to trying the other sandwiches ! 
we had to book gramercy tavern a month in advance to get a reservation and apparently it is always fully booked . everything that needs to be said has already been said by previous reviewers and there is no doubt that this is a great place to eat . i do think that it is far too expensive and whilst we had a great meal , it isn ' t ' special ' . if you want really good food in a lovely setting then it ' s worth a try , but i wouldn ' t return . i also ate at their sister restaurant ( union sq cafe ) , which i actually thought was much better value . 
i work a few miles away . i love the N sandwich and many times order the soup . while in there , i browse the nick nacks . . . from ear candles to soaps to incense and trinkets . great environment with tasty food that doesn ' t make you sluggish after eating it . plus , the little " dan ' s chocolates " they sell at the register are the perfect size for apres lunch ) keep it up ! 
realized it was reopened recently . my husband ordered the steak salad . steak was too chewy and not enough of it on the big salad . i had the chopped stinger salad that i really enjoyed . the waiter was very very slow and not too friendly . went back recently and tried their special of the day buffalo calamari and it was way too spicy and hot for my taste . they were nice enough to replace with the orginal calamari with sweet gravy . it was delicious . waitress was very attentive and sweet . 
i used to love coming to balthazar ' s but they are just not consistent in their service anymore . what used to be amazing food is now mediocre at best . 
i just went here for the first time after mistakenly finding it in a google search . very nice decor . really liked the music that was playing . then the guys behind the counter were extremely nice ! i was greeted with a smile and got one on the way out as well . to top it off . . . the desserts i picked up were amazing ! i picked up a plan slice of cheesecake , the chocolate crack pie and a red velvet brownie . my friends and i taste tested and there were smiles all around . i can ' t wait to go back to this place and try the entrees ! 
great experience overall . friendly staff and good service . food is very , very good and authentic although we all agreed over-salted . prices are just ok - could be a bit more reasonable for bbq . but not terrible either . would definitely return . 
overall i thought that emporio was on , maybe , the high side of poor , and frankly , i ' m shocked at the suspiciously over-the-top positive reviews here . my pasta ( forget the name of the dish , but it was the special ) was actually undercooked to the point of being uncooked . it was actually laughable . our server was very apologetic and said that it had a recurrent problem ( ! ! ? ? ) that night , and that she would get another dish . the substitution was a pasta dish with a cream-based sauce , and it was bland and kind of gooey . one look in the display kitchen reveals that all the food is being cranked out at lightening pace by a bunch of kids ( and i mean that almost literally ) with no apparent supervision . in my opinion , emporio is just another money-making " machine " restaurant , cranking out mediocre food at reasonable-enough prices . when a restaurant is just about the bottom line , the food suffers horribly , and what you get is emporio . another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying that this place is just another novelty restaurant . couldn ' t agree more , and won ' t ever be back . 
eight years after i first tried the steak on a stone it still is excellent . that is how i will start off this review ! wow just a good as the first thing i had this fillet minion served on the platter with the hot stone and garlic butter ! again , the sizzling steak and butter splattered all over my shirt but it was well worth the freshly cut meat . ah the memories ! ! the restaurant staff was excellent in accommodating our party of ten this evening . crowded as i would have expected they worked us in a large table in very little time . the wait staff was very attentive and helpful . i love that my drinks were always refilled and always having the order taken quickly . this evening five of ten ordered the steak on a stone ( i can recalled the original name ) and none were disappointed ! this is may fifth trip to this restaurant over the past nine years and it seems it only gets better especially with the added space and new decor . keep up the great food and good service ! i will be back on my next trip to the new jersey new york area . 
went here week one and was powerfully underwhelmed but i could sense they would get better . the fried green tomato slider is good in a sort of everything that ' s fried is delicious way , but it was billed as a " bun " and i thought it would actually be much better that way . ramen-wise , the place is solid , but at N bones a bowl , it could stand to be more than that . the ramen itself is substantial and filling , but the poached egg that accompanied my broth made everything else secondary . perfectly cooked , raised the umami quotient to seriously respectable levels . at these prices though , i feel like the whole menu could use a little more imagination . as far as execution , they ' re killing it ( oh god that pun , think of the children . ) i ' ll definitely be back because i could probably jump from my apartment window into a bowl of their ramen . as long as they jazz up the menu a little and get on that liquor license , they ' ll be great to have around . do get right on that ramen get that asahi flowing do less pricey side dishes
the soy milk chili mayo in my roasted cauliflower sandwich is what made my sandwich so tasty . the sauce had a hint of spice and the cauliflower didn ' t even taste like regular cauliflower . the sandwich was of a great individual size and it was very fulfilling . they also use the same sauce for their corn on the cob . so that means , a great side dish to order . 
as a group we have lunch here almost every thursday . today N N N i had a cheeseburger . while it was good within an hour i was having severe stomach distress . i called the manager to alert him of a possible problem and he basically blew me off saying we don ' t have any problems . not good customer relations . 
food was unbelievable . flavor explosion . they were super nice and accommodating . wish i lived nearby . prices were reasonable . best ever . 
i ' ve lived in the nabe for the better part of my N years and to me it was just the local pizza place . when i met and married my partner ( who had lived in the neighborhood for a couple of years before we met ) this became the place for us to get pizza . she is truly in love with it . it ' s to the point where she basically just orders herself a small cheese pizza about once a week . i do love their pizza and they are generous with the toppings . i wish they had a little more in the way of offerings pizza-wise . i ' d love for them to branch out with say a buffalo chicken pizza or to have an option for a pesto sauce . but they ' re very no-frills and from the stream of people in and out of there they obviously don ' t need to change to please any of their true fans . to me it ' s strictly a take out place ( kind of skeezer inside ) and i will only get pizza or grinders . i am not into their hot meals too much . 
such a cool spot , had a blast there last night with a few friends . will definitely be going back . 
as a venezuelan i can tell you this is one of the best spots for venezuelan food in nyc . tasty food , good portions , reasonable price . try the cachapas , arepas ( all are delicious ) , the empanadas , chicha , tres con leches for dessert . the main plates are good also ! oh and they do awesome traditional breakfast ( brunch ) too ! ! and don ' t forget to put that green sauce ( guasacaca ) everywhere ! its soo damn good . none of the friends i brought here left disappointed . i always come back with more friends ! my only wish was that they had a bigger space . 
would give di fara N . N stars . don ' t believe the hype , have had better . not worth a long trip to brooklyn and not worth the wait . not worth N dollars a slice , but the pizza is good . the square slice is much better than the round . 
being greek , and having no hungarian restaurants in our neck of the woods , my husband and i have been to little europe hungarian restaurant three times now . we have found that our usual dishes potato pancakes , stuffed cabbage , stuffed peppers , and cucumber salad ( especially love the cucumber salad ) to be tasty and oh-so flavorful each time . we like the quiet of the restaurant and its small size . it reminds us of one of those restaurants celebrities patronize because the masses don ' t know it exists , nor would appreciate . twice my husband and i have met chef tunde when she came out from the kitchen to ask us how our dinner was . we could tell from tunde ' s enthusiasm that she enjoys cooking and pleasing her customers and fans . my husband and i will definitely be going back a fourth time and a fifth time and . . . 
i stop by on a sunday nite and the mg very attentive tools us to a nice both ( and we didn ' t have a rsvp ) . so nice of him ! ! ! plus it was before N pm so the waitress let us enjoy the happy hour menu ! ! ! ! it was one of the bests service we had ! ! ! tacos enchapulinados and the negrony . total recommend it ! ! ! i ' ll be back for brunch ! ! ! 
our first trip to philly , and it was recommended we try one of marc vetri ' s restaurants . we liked amis , but i would say only some courses were stellar . we loved the oxtail ragu and the roasted kale . great pasta . the polenta had more of a grits consistency . we also really liked the belgian waffle dessert . overall , we liked , not loved , it . 
found this italian restaurant in south philly after a phillies game recently . we didn ' t have reservations , but got there just in time to not have to wait for a table . cozy place with great food and service ! had the fish of the day and it was very fresh and cooked perfectly . l ' angolo is on the list to go back to again ! 
the dishes are overly americanized and the service is so so . the food is not authentic and they use too much oil in cooking in general . if you want good chinese food , go to single pebble or a hole in the wall place in williston called man at wok . 
carbone ' s has done it again ! great atmosphere , drinks , food and servers . there new twist on their classic caesar salad is amazing ! ! highly recommened , cant wait to go back ! 
best sausages ! great energetic bar staff ! drink or dine , either way it ' s divine ! 
love this starbucks . friendly and knowledgeable baristas , clean store . 
helpful and friendly peeps here . this is my new hood where i stay when i ' m here in ny for business and this place has become pretty solid for me . i ' ve ordered the bolognese which is really good and has great flavor and you can tell everything is fresh and made with some time and care . the lasagna - well i don ' t know what that was because it looked pretty bad and tasted bland and pretty forgettable . to be honest - it was terrible , just terrible so stay away from that unless you are dining in . i ' ve only ever ordered for take out so i can give you no additional help for the dine in experience . delivery times are pretty quick but expect at least N-N minutes . 
i bought a groupon coupon for this restaurant to try it out . very glad i did . you never know what to expect when you try a new place but i highly recommend this place . very fresh flavorful food . tried the antipasto , calzone , and a meatball sub for my girlfriend . all were delicious , and full of flavor . will definitely go again ! ! ! i wanted to go the next day to get another calzone , but i ' ll wait until friday . 
i took my best friend here for her birthday and could not have been happier with the experience . the mussels were to die for in a broth of pure garlicy bliss . the whole flounder was as good as it gets , and the chocolate cake was heaven on a plate . that said , the star of the show was the service . the staff was on point and seamless while being utterly unpretentious . everyone who came to our table was a true pro , with a real feel for what great hospitality is all about . they brought the dessert with a candle in it even though i never told anyone it was my friend ' s birthday ( made me wonder how much they were listening to . . . but still , it was kinda amazing ) . best of all , they allowed my friend and i to sit and talk over tea for an hour , and they didn ' t drop the check until i asked for it . to the staff at blue ribbon -- front and back of the house , i say thank you for a wonderful evening . 
this place is fun ! however , why is everyone so glum ! ? ! ? ! i thought italy is eataly , and last time i checked italy is about eating and celebrating life ! the employees here look like they all just scolded and told they were not getting paid for the year or something ! i swear , not one person had a smile on , even the waiter at the salami and cheese sit down station was moody . he tried really hard to add some inflection to his tone , but i could tell he hated his job . got the cutting board with all sorts of proscuitto and cheeses on it , it comes with a little plate of fig , honey , and candied lemon peel strips . i had no idea what to do with those so i just lapped up the honey with my fingers , classy i know . the bread is extra delicious , and they were ok with giving me extra . i would love to come back and shop , but all the employees just makes me sad ( oh yeah , i also don ' t understand why you can ' t eat something from one station at another station ! 
i ' ve been here so many times , and finally am getting around to writing a review . most recently i went with a large group of friends for my birthday . the waitress was friendly and curteous , and the food was delicious . my key lime martini was incredibly delicious , and the garlic fries were phenomenal ( as always - these are a must-try ! ) . i had the salmon for my entr e , and it was some of the best cooked fish i ' ve had up here in vt . definitely recommend tip top - it ' s one of my favorite places to eat in the upper valley . 
 i am editing this review as since the below review was posted they have dramatically improved their delivery times and inclusions of common sides given with food . we ' ve not had a problem with their delivery or missing items or sides for several months now so bumping the review to N stars . old review the food is good and creative , prices are average . where the problem lies is in the service and delivery . they consistently take over an hour to deliver and never make any mention of it . usually deliveries are more between N . N to N . N hours ! but to top it all off , when you get your order you are N guaranteed to have something messed up . they almost always forget the included side of toast with your platter , they almost always forget syrup and butter with their pancakes , etc . and when you call about it they ask why you don ' t have butter and syrup in your house ! ! ! ! ! ! really ? ? ? i am paying for this , not plain pancakes and i want my toast that you specify is included . they also forgot our two large coffees twice in a row . next call i had to specifically point it out and we finally got the coffees with our order . and i don ' t want to wait an hour and a half , at least not without being told it will take that long . good food , poor service and management . 
i eat here about once a week and love it ! plus , the owner is just an over-all good guy . ( and no , it ' s not me ) ) 
 N stars for the food plus an extra star for beautiful barmaids what can i say ? i am a sucker for good looking people . put a cutie in front of me , and i turn into silly putty . oh yea , stretch me anyway you like . oh wait , i ' m getting this review mixed up with a yoga place review . or am i ? after seeing chinglish courtesy of yelp , we were pretty hungry . i mean , we sat through dinnertime with only wine ( out of a sippy cup basically ) to keep the appetite at bay . we walk over to Nth ave . , and this was the first thai place we stumbled on . i didn ' t catch the name , and my friend couldn ' t remember it . this is what happens when you get two fishes together . i was immediately mesmerized by the decor . it is quite impressive . everything is dark with a gothy vibe to it , but also a very classy , sexy twist to it . just my kind of place . candles everywhere and also a massive chandelier encased in glass in the middle of the dining room . there was also a small buddha statue in the corner . wait , but can i tell you about the drop dead gorgeous thai barmaids ? oh my god . i have died and gone to thai heaven . tall , trim , fancy updos and beautiful , beautiful shoulders . i think we gawked for a good few seconds before sitting down . my friend had already experienced this in the past . in fact , he told he was drooling for the first N minutes when he first came here . service was pretty quick here . i asked them to make me a " spicy " drink and indeed , they delivered . tamarind on the rim was a good touch . i found myself licking all of it . but the drink was too sweet , so after that , i just switched to a martini . my friend ordered the pad ee sew with veggie duck and he ate all of it , so i assume it was good . i had a tom yum soup and a green papaya salad . sad to say , both were decent , but not mind blowing . it ' s quite ok if the food is just mediocre , because the place and the barmaids were gorgeous . god , i can be so superficial at times . . . 
great appetizers - we had the kingfish with plum sauce and the chicken satay . delicious pad thai - loads of shrimp and plenty of spice ! the service was excellent and it was nice of the manager to come over and check in with our table . definitely recommend and will return soon ! 
yum yum
this place has amazing pizza . me and my family pulled off an exit to get some food and we actually accidentally pulled into the parking lot . was this a good mistake . reasonably priced , tasty pizza at it ' s best . i suggest anyone in the cranbury area check out this place . we only had their pizza , but i ' m sure everything on the menu is great . their sign to get their isn ' t extremely noticeable so make sure you keep your eyes open . you won ' t regret it ! ! ! 
great brunch and dinner spot . very good food . 
boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner , and i still am thinking about this meal days later . the filet mignon was perfect , and the rissoto blanco was quite simply one of the best things i ' ve ever tasted . rissoto with truffle oil and an egg on top , where you can pop the yolk and spread it all over the place ? count me in again , and again . . . a little pricey , but if you go on a special occasion , totally worth it ! 
the best of the best this is the best argentinian restaurant of nyc ! ! ! where do i start . . . . . sweetbread it is just perfect ! Noz rib eye unbelievable ! ! the skirt steak is definitely the best i had ever tested ! ! the ambience of el almacen is cozy , nice music , hot staff ! ! ! what can i say , i just love this place ! ! ! ! 
the suited dark-haired man that runs this place is condescending and flippant with people . wish i could say more , but after a brief chat with him i was done . 
food N stars service N stars waitress was patient to make recommendations to me despite the long line that was building up , and also introduced the different kinds of peppers ( yum , yum yum ) . it looked like there ' s also a good selection of beers to go with your sandwich . bf and i shared a sandwich but we really should ' ve each gotten one ! so good ! there ' s a good number of combinations that are on my list to try . ( the only bad thing might be the location . . . it ' s out of your usual drive and there ' s no restroom around ) 
came here last night is search of a cheap dinner . i ordered the house special noodle soup ( knife cut ) and my friend and i shared an order of dumplings . the dumplings were great , flavorful and just the right amount of filling per dumpling . the noodles were good , the knife cut is most likely a machine knife because it was too uniformed to be hand cut by a knife . they were just the right amount of chewiness . i like the dumplings more than i like the noodles but i will definitely be back . 
wolf deer is a great bar . well , it is for me , and so i think probably for you too . one of the very nice things about it - besides the wine , cocktails and most importantly to me beer ! - is that they encourage you to stay a little while , hang loose with your friends and family . i went the first week and it was nice and the service was good although did not have a traditional american pace to it ( opposite experience of what i think another reviewer was saying about rushing the check ) . and then my second visit was a few days ago and everything had improved . i think it will always be getting better . cheers to wolf deer ! 
since the makeover i have been a frequent patron . i love their beer selection ( which is ever changing ) and the cajun food is perfect after a few brews . the atmosphere is still cavernous but in a much less sketchy way than the pre-makeover khyber . yay for new beginnings ! 
easily my favorite cheese steak late night spot . better than all the supposedly famous spots ( pat ' s , geno ' s , jims ) without the frills and the side orders of racism . i personally like my cheesesteak sans prejudice . but whatever floats your boat . the staff here is pretty friendly . they like to joke around a lot with you . and a couple of the cooks are even cute ! warning this spot is always live though because its attached to a bar . and there might be a few suspect characters outside . but through max ' s doors waits cheesesteak heaven . its so sinfully delightful do not expect to only eat half . i eat the whole thing every time . and after you ' ve had one you won ' t be able to judge me . 
came here for brunch on my husband ' s birthday at the end of march . being huge amis fans , i figured this would hold up . it didn ' t . the one great thing we had was the poutine and i strongly encourage anyone to try it . i had the veggie frittata it was tiny and pretty boring . he had the biscuits and gravy with poached eggs , which was also miniature ( i prefer smaller portions in restaurants but this was laughable ) . the primary flaw in his dish was that one egg was insanely overdone . he didn ' t send it back out of fear for being seen as a birthday diva . the bloody marys are standard fair , but the other drinks need some work . i tried the sangria but it was yikes , so i asked for sparkling wine and it was served tepid and flat . one nice thing they gave him a birthday dessert . service was okay , though a little neglectful but the host staff were excellent and welcoming . it ' s not a terrible place and maybe we just didn ' t order the right things . i will probably stick with cafe lift as the menu is cleaner and definitely less for similar quality . 
i have eaten here many times , mainly for the brussels sprouts . it ' s impossible to explain if you haven ' t eaten them . they are divine . and yummy . they appeal to high-brow and low-brow alike . all of their other food is good , too . highlights green beans ( i think this is no longer on the menu ) , yams , hummus , fresh mint tea , ashta . weird falafel but i like it anyway . props for offering watercress salad , since i love watercress . one word of caution do not , on pain of death , order the special orange blossom white tea -- it ' s like drinking perfume . i don ' t think it is tea . hurray for available seating at any time of day or night ( almost ) . the space is huge , and welcoming and warm with interesting wood paneling from floor to ceiling . there is an upstairs space and they once seated a party of about N with no reservation on saturday night ( shh ) ! i realize this was luck . it ' s best to make a reservation . if there are no seats , you can sit in the lounge area and order food there . the bar menu is extensive and it ' s the same delicious food . the service is fantastic and has never been bad ( and i ' ve been here a lot ) . i ' ve never been here for brunch but the menu looks enticing too . so , in closing , i love this restaurant . a lot . and everyone i have ever taken here loves it too . 
fluffy words , but very little substance . this place is amateur hour at it ' s best . first off , if you read their website everything seems very nice and the different menu options are all wonderfully described . then reality hits . the chefs look like college students hired off the street and the food pretty much proves this . the broth is poorly flavored - seems like too much water in the base and a bunch of seasonings dumped in - it ' s not a very fulfilling experience . the noodles are of cup noodle quality and worse than nom nom even . it ' s also inconsistently plated - sometimes the toppings are on top and sometimes they are smothered by the noodles . the menu is extremely limited and i can see why - the core items ( ramen ) aren ' t even done right . i shudder to think what " bi-weekly " menu changes will bring - if anything , more inconsistency . service is so-so . not bad , but not great either . noodles took a long time to come out which is a negative considering they aren ' t that great . decor is extremely simple . it ' s like a low-rent version of ramen boy almost , but too bare for any type of decent ambiance . " industrial " is putting it kindly - this is more like " bare bones " . there are much better options in philly bottom line - ramen bar , nom nom , terakawa . much too crowded to give this place a second look . 
the food was good but definitely sit upstairs for a quiet dinner , and the butter lettuce was incredible . 
i ' m obsessed , this place just has great food and atmosphere . it is a place to be and been seen , as well as people watch in rittenhouse square . 
i can totally appreciate how good the banh mi is at sampan . i tried the pork banh mi fnN vietnamese meatball banh mi fnN and , even at N fnN , they ' re both good enough that i foresee this place coming into my regular lunch rotation . i even know what i ' m going to order the pork ramen fnN . the shrimp pad thai was the only thing i found unremarkable . i ' m not sure that i can make any useful comments about the service , considering the circumstances fnN . the servers were friendly , though fnN . i also really enjoy the layout and the lighting . i have a feeling that sampan could make a prime date spot fnN . highly recommended . fnN i stopped in friday afternoon for the free pork banh mi deal that sampan was having to promote their new lunch hours . if it tastes this good as a mass-produced giveaway , i can only imagine how much better it might be next time . fnN my roommate also bought my to-go vietnamese meatball banh mi as a ' thank you ' for watching his dog over the weekend . i brought it with me to brooklyn when i was visiting friends and we devoured it like locusts . fnN okay , technically , i didn ' t pay for anything in my review . just note that this is a N markup over q . t . in chinatown and nearly double anywhere in south philly . it is N less than at mi lah but the sandwich there is larger . fnN i ' m very interested in comparing the ramen here against morimoto and snackbar , none of which i ' ve tried yet . fnN see footnote N , supra . fnN when we were leaving , she asked me if we worked near here . i told her i was an attorney at a nearby firm , prompting this response " aw , that ' s adorable . you ' re so young ! " followed by a big ol ' hug . fnN i have unverified reports from non-yelp friends i ' ve sent that i am correct in this regard . bring your lady or your dude . if you get frisky later on , you ' re welcome . 
i am not a fan of thin crust well done pizza , but i am the minority in my family . everyone else ( husband kids ) love the pizza and the calamari they say is excellent , hardly ever chewy i like the mozzarella sticks , they are like slabs of fried cheese , it tastes better than it sounds . if you don ' t get there the minute they open or during off hours there will be a wait ! but usually it is a wait that is worthwhile . 
i have been remiss in writing a review on this place from my former visit . this is a favorite spot of dear friends of mine , who i was with for both visits . great atmosphere , amazingly friendly and attentive service . as some others pre-warned , soup sizes are very small ! recommend you pair a soup with an appetizer . got bun bo hue and it was amazingly flavorful and just right amount of heat . papaya salad was very good . if you get a noodle dish or vermicelli bowl like my friends did , the portions are huge and filling ! fantastic cafe su da . . . always a plus for me when they get the coffee right ! some folks are into wine and dinner pairings , but this sober , caffeinated woman likes to have the java jive with the meal ! an addt ' l , not-related recommendation for a fri evening in w . philly Nnd and last fri ' s at Nth and baltimore -- a mere hop , skip and jump away from this place -- is an awesome poetry slam ! go to studio N yoga ( yellow door ) , starting Np . open mic , then the official slammers . a great night out ! 
this place has the best drunken noodles and tom yum . i always ask for everything every spicy and they make it spicy and also give me their homemade hot sauce to add to it . their lunch specials have to be the best in the city you get salad , appetizer and main for N-N dollars . it is a really good deal especially because it is really tasty . 
wow . the carnitas burrito was the closest thing i ' ve had to a cali burrito in new york . 
i was recently in philly for the ufc show and decided to stop by genos . i can flat out say that was easily one of the worst cheese steaks i have ever eaten in my entire life . there was nothing special about it other than the long line and the N minute wait . the steak had no flavor , it was cold , the cheese wasn ' t even close to melted and the slices of meat weren ' t to far off from steak um ' s quality . i was greatly disappointed . i ended up getting a better cheese steak at the downtown marriott . i would give geno ' s a negative rating if yelp had the option . . don ' t fall into the tourist traps ! ! ! ! ! imo philly cheese steaks are vastly overrated and you can find a good cheese steak just about anywhere in this country . 
our server this evening was impeccable and above all knowledgeable of the food- and pastas . the food was to-die-for , and as a foodie i don ' t say that lightly . today was my designated day of gluttony and after N apps , a salad , entree , and dessert , i couldn ' t of been happier . every single dish was top notch- they deserve every accolade they get . 
soup dumplings . . . . . oh my g-d . no reservations , long waits during prime time , communal tables , servers are neutral , but the soup dumplings are just soooooo good . oh , btw , the chinese food is also good ! get the pork soup dumplings . . . the crab dumplings are not good . general tso ' s and kung pao chicken are on par with top chinese restaurants . lo mean is very good . tips weekday lunch ( get there at N Nam and you are good , get there at N Npm and you are probably waiting N-N minutes ) . weekend dinner . . . . still haven ' t figured it out . . . . always waiting ! the other option is the joe ' s midtown location , but the chinatown location has the cache you are looking for . 
condujimos desde ny solo para probar los famosos cheesesteak de sonny ' s , y desde luego mereci la pena ! nos arrepentimos de no haber comido dos bocadillos cada uno ! ! pedimos beef steak con cheez whiz y grilled onions , de las cosas mas deliciosas que he comido en mi vida ! ! ademas de estar en el centro de la ciudad , el precio es barat simo , pagamos N y comimos dos personas con patatas y bebida . lo aconsejo como lugar obligado al visitar philadelphia . 
reviewers of this restaurant sure seem to have an over abundance of confidence in their food writing skills--writing skills in general . the " want crab croquette now " review was the most informative , helpful and had the least implication of overwhelming sense of entitlement and importance of any of the reviews here . rye restaurant reviewers on yelp here ' s a hint don ' t make your writing try to read like the mostly crappy food writing in the nytimes . ( amanda hesser remains an idiot and bruni and sifton aren ' t werent much better . ) to you that newspaper may define the world , now get over that attitude , and learn to write about what you like or dislike and avoid adjectives like " comfortable " or " charming " --the list goes on . the noun " atmosphere " is a stupid choice too , and if you can ' t figure out why , stop writing and spare us . ( anybody else here think it completely unacceptable for yelp to ask for your registration email ' s password--just what i want , yelp to know how to read my emails from glen beck thanking me for my support . ) yelp also runs a lot of java script in my browser--wtf . let ' s see if this review of the reviewers and yelp gets posted . have a drink at the bar , i hear it has a good jack rose ( sort of an orange margarita my mother introduced me to more than N years ago , and more than N years ago my father introduced me to wild turkey rye . ) 
such a memorable place-- very interesting location and great view of hartford . the food was absolutely amazing . i especially loved how the chef made the effort to send out several small complementary plates at the beginning and end of the meal . the service was friendly and relatively efficient . the only reason i didn ' t rate onN a five is because while the atmosphere is classy and sophisticated , it feels a bit stuffy . my boyfriend took me there for my birthday , and possibly because we are on the young side , i feel like we might not have been taken as seriously or given as much attention as some of the older , wealthier looking patrons . 
superb food , wine and service at lunch at the gander . it ' s a very pretty restaurant . also quite large , although it was almost empty at lunch on a tuesday . we adored every dish we tried . appetizers were a nice octopus dish and then the sea trout tartare which is absolutely not to be missed . delicious flavors ( fried capers were to die for ) , fresh fish , beautiful presentation , and a generous portion . for entrees we had the perfectly cooked salmon dish and the rich spaghetti with clams ( half portion was very small but after a large appetizer i was happy to not have a huge plate of spaghetti ) . both entrees were very memorable . for dessert , strangely out waiter did not offer the menu but brought us little " blondie " bites on the house . yummy ! i would like to come back for dinner some time . 
holy shnikes ! ! ! ! what a find ! i go every week thats how good this place is . lets start off with the bread , yum ! lets move on to the seared tuna avocado appetizer , holy ! its so good we order N each ! the calamari salad is so awesome , its so big ! salads are all great and the steak , with parmesan on top , omg . need i say more ? its amazing ! all the waiters speak italian too , bellisimo ! 
this place was ridiculous . everything was so overpriced . i wanted to get my son in law a box of chocolates and i think for like a handful of pieces it was something like N . way too much . food was okay , not that great . onion rings were actually very disappointing , i did not like them one bit . waffle fries were good . fish was good too . took a while for us to get our cocktails . i ' m not sure why because no one was really there . they had a lot of staff just sort of hanging around and shmoozing . didn ' t feel like they even knew i was there waiting for service . i have a feeling our server just wasn ' t into serving that day . place was pretty empty and took a while to get orders in and food to the table . i ' m glad the servers are all friends and such , but there ' s a time and a place to do your job . i won ' t be back . 
awesome place to see a mix of philly food and people culture ! love all the options and would have been a N star but very uncomfortable walking out being hounded by addicts as you walk in and out of the entrances . little too cramped and crowded at times . 
i used to go to the montville diner regularly years ago . the food was quite acceptable then . but my husband and i went back one day last week , and we had the worst food ever ! i had stuffed cabbage , and their was no liquid in the stuffing . it was just dried out cooked beef and rice , with no seasoning . it was absolutely awefull ! my husband ordered a side of spinach and rice , and it smelled worse than dog food and tasted worse . i had to spit it out . tasted like old canned spinach mixed with dried out rice . needless to say we will never go back there again ! ! 
in the spot of the long-lamented pif , a new country french byo has emerged . the decor has not changed much , the addition of a few ikea curtains and a fresh layer of paint , but that is part of the charm of this tiny eatery , and its forlorn location at Nth and washington , just outside the italian market . the food is impeccable , although it may strain the patience of the red-gravy crowd in philly . with head cheese , pigs feet , and such offerings on the menu , it is a very traditional french joint , which is a rarity in this town . 
when i worked downtown city steam was the place on friday ' s after work . 
great location , and attentive service . only N tables in this tiny establishment . the dishes were pretty to look at and wonderful to eat . 
cool place , prices are cheap enough
great experience to visit scott i never forget this visit in my life , lovely place for visit . 
restaurant week . delicious all three courses . nice music on a weeknight . not too loud . and some attractive faces good people watching but mostly on dates . 
when i feel like staying in northern liberties but making the trek down to spring garden i ' ll stop by silk city . nightlife ' s pretty good , but unfortunately they have a N cover for the dance side of the place . is it worth it ? occasionally , but there are places close by that have dancing with no cover ( see N club and finnegan ' s wake ) . the dj is good , just a hard time justifying the cover . i ' d given this place N stars except for the cover . 
another blink-or-you ' ll-miss-it hole-in-the-wall-esque joint that the lovely borough of brooklyn has become so famous for . an unassuming building is the actual shop , with the only indication of it as a banh mi joint being an upright fold-able chalk board with menu items written on it . insert cliche " don ' t judge a book by its cover " variation here , but seriously , a place looking like this does not scream " we make awesome banh mi ! " the baguette is toasty and almost pressed ( which i like so i don ' t need to dislocate my jaw to take a bite ) , the pickled veggies give that sour zing which just sets off the banh mi brilliantly as it cuts against any grease the meat gives off , and the cold cuts and the pate are as tasty as it gets . they certainly don ' t skimp on the cold cuts , and the pate gives that unique smooth and savory texture and taste ( respectively ) that any self respecting banh mi ought to have . the end product delivers in spades . the bubble tea is also a favorite item , with many of my friends who i ' ve been here with raving about it . might be high time that i get one for myself . easily one of the best banh mi joints in nyc , maybe even the best . but one thing ' s for certain , for anyone that loves banh mi ( or food for that matter ) , the trip to east williamsburg for this place is worth it . 
the inside is definitely a bar , but not too bad . the bistro burger ( medium , comes with cheese and bacon ) was very good - the bacon was also very tasty itself and crunchy - mmmm . the fries were piping hot and crunchy - delicious . the service was good , but they only accept cash here ( there is an atm inside ) . i guess its pretty cheap , especially for new york . i definitely appreciated this pit stop . 
awesome great-idea-at-the-time late-night drunk food , not so sure about the next day tho ' ! 
great food . great service . 
oh my how i love italian , and this was a standard northeast corridor italian joint with good food and real pasta . . . in other words , greatness ! i came here for a rehearsal dinner , and was pretty impressed with the service and the food . it ' s always tough to wait on people when a N top sits down ( even when you know they ' re coming ) , but all of us had everything we needed and in good time . there was plenty of vino on the table when we sat down , and i loved the homey atmosphere of the place . our prix fixe meal was a decent salad , a good pasta course with legit sauce , a choice of entree which begat me a pretty good chicken parmigana . . . and some unreal desserts . they brought us a tray of several of their offerings , and t the tiramisu was absolutely delicious . believe me , i shoved quite a few options down my already overfull gullet . i don ' t know if it ' s the water , or just the access to much better bakeries in this area . . . but the italian desserts when i come back to philly are always better than home . there ' s nothing about this place that ' ll jump out at you , but that doesn ' t mean it isn ' t delicious anyway . i ' m a big fan , and am glad to have found a place down by the water as a great jumpoff point for a night out either on south street or in penns landing . 
all i ' m going to say is swordfish kebab
my girlfriend and i have been here N times now . the decor is very outdated . it looks like my great grandmas house . it feels sticky and dirty in the booths and the worst part is the food . i will never return . gordon ramsey should drop in for kitchen nightmares . 
i love their tea . . . they have a variety of flavored and bubble teas . the sandwiches are great as well . the staff is nice and very friendly ! ! my coworkers and i are regular customers during lunch time since we work nearby . 
yes , it ' s a bit expensive and crowded , but that shouldn ' t stop you from going ! the food is excellent and worth it . the architecture is incredible , and your time there will be well spent ! 
great place ! they are very clean . the staff members are very friendly . the food is also very delicious . this is to mr ar that posted a bad review about the owner having an attitude . for those who know the owner , he is a very friendly more of a people pleaser , so go shopping and cook your own food instead of being an a ! i have been all over the middle east , mostly in israel . i believe this is some of the best middle eastern food that i ever had . i ordered the chicken shawerma plater that was very delicious , and my kids order two falafel sandwiches . of course i had to try it , and i must say it was absolutely devine . to go experience when i first entered falafely yours , the owner and staff members greeted me with a warm welcome . i ordered an immense amount of food for my mothers dinner party . business was slightly busy , so i figured it would take at least N minutes for the order . i ordered a catering size of the hummus with pita bread , four orders of the falafel sides , and they suggested for me to try the morrocan carrot salad . i must say it was so good , i ordered one for myself while i waited . the owner is impressively attentive . without telling me , he worked on my large order and i was out of there within fifteen to twenty minutes ! wow ! ! ! ! what great service . 
ok , i have to say that foodtown in lake hiawatha is not your grandstand grocery store , however i don ' t need a super store to do my food shopping . my experiences at foodtown are far better than shoprite of parsippany . the foodtown staff and management are helpful and friendly , willing to assist their customers , and their weekly specials are great . not a great selection of produce and meat , however they are far better than some other stores around . i like the fact that when i shop there they know me and my kids and greet us with a nice hello ! i shop at foodtown regularly and enjoy that i dont have to fight for a parking spot , wait in a long line and deal with impolite shoppers . 
i really want to love this place . i live close , so it ' s easy to walk over there for happy hour or a late night drink , both of which i have done a couple times . i have never eaten a full meal here , which is maybe why my review is N-stars . every time i have been , i feel like they are slightly annoyed that i am there . i like to order cheaper beers , and have only gotten happy hour snacks , and i feel like they resent that i am not ordering more expensive things . my favorite aspect is the outdoor patio , which doesn ' t have a great view , but is dog friendly . the last time i brought my dog however , there were a couple other dogs there who weren ' t very accustomed to other pooches and it made for some tension between the tables . this place has also been fairly dead every time i have been , which is why i feel like it ' s even more strange that the staff isn ' t more welcoming . they always push the full food menu , which i am sure is really good , but i haven ' t tried and can ' t speak on . i feel like alla spina does not live up to the hype for me , and i wish that it did . i really like the cider they have on tap right now , and i love that it ' s just down the street . however , i wish i felt more appreciated when i was there . 
the food is always decent , but there ' s much better thai the neighborhood ! also , our server told us when we ate there last weekend that if a dish is sent back , the cost is subtracted from the server ' s paycheck . i ' m pretty sure this is illegal and would hesitate to eat in a restaurant where the staff is treated so poorly ! 
good food . . usually go for the obento box , and has yet to be disappointed . 
the best italian deli in hudson county . not only are their sandwiches great , but they make the best broccoli rab i have ever had . and their fresh made chicken soup is a meal all by itself . they cater every party i have and i just love the fact that it exists - life is better . 
ugh it ' s true , you will wait and wait for a while but as my friends rolled off their red eye flights and we walked down here from my other friend ' s place on st . mark ' s and a , it was well worth the wait . morning cocktails in hand , the worst part of clinton st . was really choosing what we ' d all order to make sure we would all get the chance to steal off other plates and try more things . with over N reviews i ' m not going to tell you anything groundbreaking here but the service was friendly , the food was delicious , the location is cute and homey and i will certainly be back again ! 
best lunch deal in the area ! they always have a good selection of pizza for lunch time . N . N will get you two large slices and a drink . most times , i cannot even finish a slice by myself ! delivery takes some time and price for whole pizza is a tad on the pricey side though , hence only N stars . 
terrible service , food , atmosphere , portion sizes . will never go back . 
this place is just plain awesome . food is made fresh everyday . every panini is outstanding . just don ' t ask for any substitutions . not that anything needs to be altered . it is cheap to boot . 
great fajitas and very inexpensive . the chips and salsa is great too . my favorite mexican american restaurant . 
as promised we made a return visit for happy hour N -N and we are really glad we did . the bar had an eclectic crowd , and the bartender made quick rounds keeping everyone ' s glass full . when the bartender came over to say hello she made sure we understood it was happy hour and showed us the happy hour specials . N domestic drafts , N glasses of wines , free chips and salsa , N sliders , N for N cheese sticks and N blu balls . the blu balls were awesome ! think chicken cordon bleu , only tater-tot sized . you will love these . we did spin the shot wheel ) and after doing our shots the bartender said they were on her . nice ! i think we have found another happy hour bar nearby and we are really excited about it . looking forward to returning ! 
wow , if you enjoy quality food and have some money , check this place out . i recommend the chef ' s tasting menu bc it ' s a nice surprise . i ' m not a big mushroom person but those sauteed mushrooms were damn ridiculous . awesome ridiculous . . . pricey but well worth it . 
since i had such a great experience , i recommended this place to my boss . she catered food from stix for an important client meeting we had yesterday and everyone was pleasantly surprised to not have sandwiches for lunch . the great food definitely put everyone in a good mood and many of the clients said they wanted to go to stix . i think i will try to go one weekend to try their brunch since i have had two really good experiences ! 
cannot say enough about this place . had delicious cocktails and dinner was wonderful ! cannot wait to go back . 
i was not on board with the whole fancy pizza thing-- until i came to paulie gee ' s ! this place is the best . amazing pizza , quality service . and paulie himself is almost always there , talking to the guests , being friendly , funny and welcoming . my only complaint is that i wish i lived closer to it ! 
i attended a dual birthday celebration here and was well pleased with the quality of service . the decor and ambiance are delightful to the senses and very comfortable . our large group was able to unwind and enjoy ourselves easily . our arrangement was for Npp for passed appetizers and bottles of wine . apps were quite good , the wine not so much . i would return but be more discerning with the house delgated wine choice . 
it ' s all good . that ' s the writing on the wall . it took me N months and close to half a dozen visits to realize that luzzo ' s is absolutely my favorite pizza in manhattan . it might be because i am more culturally attuned to new york style pizza , than to neapolitan style pizza . it might also be that i didn ' t appreciate its simplistic genius the first few times . and , all too often humility is an under-appreciated virtue . surrounded by many big names in pizza , and in all the hoopla created by " the choke " , it was easy to overlook luzzo ' s . ironically , i discovered luzzo ' s by accident . i had planned a get together of friends at the nearby una pizza napoletana without realizing that they were closed for the day . prodded by hunger , we took a chance at this unassuming restaurant nearby which had the rustic feel of a small caf in italy . as we conversed with the servers , we realized from the language barrier that this indeed was the real deal . all the servers and the pizzaioli were italian , and by that i do not mean from italy by way of staten island . yes - i am looking at you , artichoke ) i liked luzzo ' s pizza then , but at that time i wasn ' t sure that i loved it . the texture of the pizza was soft and chewy . it was thin , but not crispy , except at the edges . charred by the coal oven , the crust was definitely unique . the sauce was simple , sweet and tangy , and made perhaps from canned tomatoes . the creamy mozzarella di buffala was the star , extremely fresh and uniquely presented in the shape of large polka dots all over the pizza . it was exquisitely light , and delicious . but , i wasn ' t sold on the crust . used to the crispier nyc version , i found the pizza chewy , and at times a little bland . over a period of time , i got to appreciate the fact that this pizza was perfectly executed per neapolitan standards . a well made pizza in naples is described as one where you can fold the pizza in half and then again into quarters , without cracking or breaking the crust . this is definitely the case with luzzo ' s , which is one of the most pliant in the city ! also , the pizzaioli have started charring the crust more , making better use of the coal oven . so , now not only do you have the desired chewiness , but the crust is also crisper and with a number of bubbles . i have struggled with this five star rating . one of the problems of authenticity is challenges in communication . at times , my pizza order has been delayed because the multiple servers haven ' t coordinated well between them . i have also found the pastiera ( italian cake made with ricotta cheese and candied fruit ) to be refrigerated and not as texturally complex as other versions in the city . i also fear that they will be unable to handle the crowds as their fame spreads . in short , their management skills are untested . but , in mirroring the mood of the country , i decided to overlook my present fears and concerns about their ability to deliver in the future and bumped them up to five stars . i can not fault them for authenticity , genius , and flair . heck , i can even overlook a martha stewart endorsement for that . 
cute and i like how they have a picture booth thing . 
omg , went on a friday night at Npm and we wait for a table for N hour N mins . . . . . i knew this going in and i decided that the wait is not worth it . the food was good , but i am not willing to wait that long for ramen the pork bun are of course great but there are of course other place you can get the same like momofuku
nice place . friendly people . lot ' s of locals and regulars . good place if you live in the neighborhood . 
points for k-town ! as soon as you sit down you ' re served hot tea ( roasted rice tea ) N or so banchan ( korean condiments ) strategically placed on a two-top as if he was going for the win in checkers . we ordered seafood tofu -bubbling hot homemade tofu ( resembled tofu scramble ) , rich flavored broth , pcs of squid , shrimp surfaced in each spoon full - very comforting on a cold night . mushroom crab bibimbop -succulent mushrooms , crab , enoki , assort . veggies . dose it w sesame soy and chili paste -sure to please . so good , that the true asian came out in full force as i fought bff for the crunchy burnt part down the bottom of the stone bowl . best one by far . ( used to frequent sura on Nth ) liked efficient waiter and staff cute ceramics , pictures lanterns , wooden beams just the right amount of christmas decor portions were perfect moderately priced disliked kim chi ( preferred sura ) 
went to this place on a recommendation from a friend . i wont be listening to that person again . this place is a dive . its small and the sushi was below average . 
love this window shop , i stop there often on my way home from the subway after work . wonderful addition to the neighborhood ! 
wham ! bam ! thank you mam ! jeepney exceeded my high expectations with their friendly service delicious eats ! without even looking at the menu , place an order or two for the following and you will not regret it ! -sisig tacos this bad boy packs a punch and is probably one of the best tacos i ' ve had ever ! the mix of pig ears , snout , cheek , belly , garlic , bird s eye chili , red onions , kalamansi , cilantro and avocado crema was absolutely mouthwatering delish and was by far the best dish of the evening ! -ribs holy moly crazy tender in-house marinated wings that melt in your mouth and pull apart like whoa ! get these bad boys to continue the party in your mouth ! -bicol express are you sure this is pork shoulder ? this tasted more like a buttery tenderloin dressed to the nines in a special and sauce which took me by surprise and had me bowing down by the end of my meal . this was more tender than the ' holy moly crazy tender ' wings and is one of the more popular dishes here . you can upgrade your white rice this dish is served with to a garlic or a coconut rice , which is amazing and highly recommended ! trust me - get the garlic rice ! so amazingly flavorful ! ) the drinks were also great . i opted for the pina colada my husband had the sangria . both were refreshing and complemented our meals perfectly ! 
i went there for lunch and was impressed . the portions are generous , the service was attentive , and the food was really good ! i would recommend this place to anyone ! 
great food ! especially the pulled chicken sandwiches ! excellent service too . anytime i needed a napkin , fork or more water - a waitress was right there ! cant wait to go again
inviting atmosphere and meaty burritos . 
i probably go here every other week for their pho or vermicelli with grilled pork . service is quick , food is cheap , portions are generous and i ' ve never had issues getting seated no matter how busy they seem . really delicious . 
ok , so the place is not the best look one around , but here is the deal . i have eaten at almost all the stalls and you just cannot go worry at this place . the food is amazing and cheap forget the high priced indian restaurants in the area give this place a try and keep an open mind . 
the most wonderful restaurant , beautiful decor , experienced staff and best of all the most delicious food . we weren ' t sure what to order so we had the sampler including the lamb ( cooks for four days ) . every course was better than the one before . just loved the whole experience . definetly highly recommend ! 
my girlfriend and i called at two separate time to try to make a reservation but both times we were assured that we wouldn ' t be waiting long N minutes at most . we arrive at nicola ' s and found out that we have a N hour wait . i called inside and wanted to talk to a manager . as i was talking to the manager and telling her that we called the day before to reserve a table for two and were denied a reservation for two and the manager said we cater to tables of N or more not small tables . she was pretty much saying that small tables means nothing to them and want to save their time for big tables . she was very rude on the phone and she was not listening to what i was saying . when i call ahead to make sure i have a table i want a table . we do not live close to this restaurant so we drove out there for nothing . i would not recommend anyone go here . we decided right away that it wasnt worth the wait . how can you be so rude in the hospitality business ? 
ribs ribs ribs i love the the ribs . the mac and cheese . you have to try the mac and cheese . i indulged in a slice of the grandmas apple pie i wish i had some ice cream but other then that it was great . friendly service . i love greek food but this is a nice change from the norm in the area . 
stick with the original margherita pizza for the best experience . adding toppings is not so bad but i just think a good pizza is good at its simplest form . the white is too rich for me and i had to remove some of the cheese from it so i could fully enjoy it . come for the history and enjoy the food . then get dessert at rice to riches across the street . p
good
do yourself a favor and visit dinic ' s when you are in philly . forget the cheesesteak ( unless you go to jim ' s Nth south ) dinic ' s sandwiches are the best ! the pork with spinach is great and the italian sausage with peppers and onions is a must try . if you like provolone , they have the sharpest i ' ve ever had . nice people , nice place ! 
i just received a delivery order from here and a vial bug was sauteed in the food ! i posted a picture in the photos ! gross ! ! ! i called to complain and they offered me a free entree with the next order . i won ' t be eating there again ! good luck ! ! 
what happened here ! ! i went to cranbury pizza about N weeks ago and had pizza . it was wonderful ! i came in today and it was the worst pizza i had ever had . i would rather go to papa johns . . i had a simple lg plain , and it was burnt , cheese was all over ( the little amount the pizza man put on it ) and the tast of the pizza was just bad . 
go here if you like gourmet pizza . N . N to N per slice . try the focaccia pizza . 
apps are tdf , burgers hit the spot . they handle big parties well . the varied beer selection was a welcome find . we will be back ! 
ai fiori , for a hotel restaurant , is certainly serviceable . it , however , doesn ' t have that ethereal quality of marea or the rustic , hearty feel of osteria morini . 
working in the semi-food desert where chinatown meets tribeca , i am always looking for interesting lunch options , and mooncake foods was a pleasant surprise which fit the bill . presenting a mixture of interesting , seemingly healthy asian-inspired dishes , it was a great choice for an inexpensive , filling bite on a recent weekday afternoon . i stopped in with a friend around N Npm which was a smart choice as we were able to be seated immediately in the diminutive dining space . i can imagine that there is a wait here during prime lunch hour . i ordered a delicious grilled chicken and avocado salad , which came out in a huge bowl served with mixed greens . the chicken seemed more marinated than grilled , but the flavors blended nicely , and it was a light but filling option . my friend went for a steak sandwich which looked banh mi-esque in its composure , and he said it was enjoyable . we enjoyed a couple of their fragrant iced teas with our meal which were a refreshing touch . overall , mooncake foods is a nice addition to the lunch options in this area , and a welcome change with its fresh , flavorful menu choices . 
while staying in the les you can imagine how easy it is to get trapped in this touristy section of town . my partner loves italian food and because of its zagat this and that ( zagat is overrated and for money folk ) we sat down to eat . taking a quick at the european families , professional cameras , and walking shoes i could tell there were probably very few locals or returning patrons . this place depends on tourists and can jack up prices because of it . we had calamari apps , i ' ve had better and much cheaper . but the shrimp scampi and salmon dish were well cooked and really good . i don ' t think i ' d ever go back , but i ' m glad i tried and enjoyed it . 
so disappointed in the way they handled the hepatitis a issue at the restaurant . i received a phone call from the dept of health . , so i called alta directly and was put on hold for N minutes . when they finally were able to speak to me ( briefly ) , they said they would call me back the next day . i never received a return phone call nor an apology from alta . my dining companion has a compromised liver , so this is huge deal . she has to go to her immunologist to handle this and get the appropriate remedy . i have eaten there several times and do like the food ( ironically the dessert was the biggest disappointment ! ) , but won ' t go back . . . . 
i have been going to queen ' s comfort since it opened about N mo ago . the food is unique and tasty . my absolute fav are the disco tots , tator tots covered in cream gravy and cheese . you also can ' t go wrong with the fried green tomato po ' boy , chicken and waffles or the pulled pork sandwich . the atmosphere is fun , there is always some old move playing on the projector and it is byob ! it is a great deal in the city . totally worth trying out . 
it ' s a busy place . the food is ok . go for the special of the day . it ' s usually fresh and made that day . 
great pub grub , good selection of beers , and best of all , cheap ! great bar ! 
the mochi was good , the filling was alright . that was really the only disappointing part of the snack experience . i think it ' s worth the price if you just remember how good it all tastes and that you can get free refills on the tea . i got the uji kabusecha and it was a great green tea . grassy and delicious . however , the most amazing thing was the black sesame creme brulee . i don ' t think anything will top this dessert in any japanese tea house . 
 N smoothies on tuesday are amazing . you pick what N fruits you want so it is truly your own creation . i also had the beef shawarma wrap . was very nice and very filling . they ' ve changed their hours recently ( i think for ramadan ) so i actually went there at Npm and was great that they were still open . very quiet at that time too . 
good food at a reasonable price . 
adhd innovative small plate . properly hidden in the theater district with a melange of people in the know . can be a bit cold in the winter atmosphere this is on my hide and seek list for a reason . it ' s downstairs an a little hard to find . most people are not theater district folks . the inside is quite dive-y . the service it can vary depending on how busy the restaurant gets . you do have to work a little to get their attention . the food creative and fun . first , i want to point out that you can get a pitcher of beer here . that is just such a rare thing in nyc , it bears speaking about . all of the small plates were pretty good . the have indicators on the one you should try . i ' d like to highlight , though the tempura pizza . i thought for sure i ' d hate it and it would be the joke of this review . instead . yum ! ! it does not have a little star next two it , but it ' s so unqiue i definitely suggest . 
bottom line lucali ' s is solid but over-hyped . it ' s really good pizza , but it ' s not the cuilinary orgasm some claim . some details N . crust . solid a . it ' s thin , charred and chewy -- clearly a lot of effort goes into the foundation . excellently done ! N . sauce . it ' s a solid b to b but not amazing . N . toppings . c to b . the sausage and peperoni are pedestrian . the fresh ricotta isn ' t awe-inspiring . the mozarella , like everything else , is as good as , but not better than any other high-end pizza joint . N . service . solid b . expect long waits , but they set the right expectations . the cute brooklyn-italian waitresses in tight jeans are much nicer than you ' d expect -- no peter lugar style abuse here . they really don ' t rush you either , which is a huge plus considering the line at the door . if you can walk to lucali ' s , it ' s worth it . but stick to your local equivalent if a crosstown trip is needed -- neighborhood parking is brutal . 
we waited for about N min to get a seat at around Npm . quick to serve our table of N . ( number N ) was too salty , N had poor portions and cold shrimp , N pork was good , bo hue ( N ) was fine but not great . was not the best and would not go again . 
i have been going to bove ' s since i was a young child and my father was going to college at uvm . . . it was a weekly stop for us and i still go there whenever i go to the burlington area because the food is awesome and it holds such a special place in my heart . my parents always ask to go there when we are even close to the area . 
ants pants now has dinner , but brunch is still their strong suit . like breakfast all our food came out at once instead of our salad coming out first and then our entree . our table was a two top , and here we were with a three large plates and two small plates and two glasses ! not to mention my friend and i are both klutzes this was a recipe for a disaster waiting to happen . our beetroot salad was great and i am going to start frying capers and putting them on everything . the eggplant fries were greasy and not my idea , but my friend really wanted to try them . they were worth trying so we know not to get them again . we shared the fish tacos and they were incredible . perfect fish , homemade corn tortillas that kinda fall apart , but in a good way and amazing fresh pineapple jalape o salsa . i will definitely be back for the fish tacos , but can skip the eggplant fries ! 
terrific staff , very accommodating . mushroom risotto is fantastic . 
the food was absolutely delicious , the service was great . i had the tilapia and the cesar salad it was all fresh and the desserts were to die for ! i highly recommend going here for a nice family meal . i will definitely be going back ! ! 
our visit to the restaurant was a last minute decision on our way to see a show on broadway . we were apprehensive initially about choosing the place somewhat randomly , but very pleasantly surprised with the entire experience . it was crowded and filled w lots of pre-theatre diners so we were concerned about service when our waiter took a long time to take our order . however , once we placed our order , the food came quickly , was hot and really delicious . the rigatoni focaccia was fabulous as was the chicken parm and the pasta e fagioli soup ! the bread basket was filled with warm , scrumptious bread that we devoured and the service was friendly and efficient like a well-oiled machine . even though it was clear that lots of patrons were in a hurry to get to their shows , the staff responded in an efficient manner that was still relaxed , professional and still achieved a welcoming atmosphere . as one table of diners asked for their check halfway thru their dinner , the server said " finish your dinner , i promise the check will take N minutes , relax enjoy " . we will definitely go back and highly recommend ! 
went with three friends , ate a lot , then had a heated debate over what our favorite dish was with no conclusive decision . our waiter played a huge role in making suggestions , he was great . the soundtrack was some awesome early Ns hip hop . great night . thank you roberta ' s . 
great food , friendly service . love this place ! have had several meals there and always try something different . the staff is great with suggestions and explaining what things are if i ' m i sure . 
wow ! i am completely blown away and boggled by the negative reviews i am reading . i am a born and raised Nnd streeter and could not be more ecstatic about this place ! it ' s such a welcoming addition to our neighborhood and it ' s refreshing to see a corner bar that doesn ' t have a massive brawl erupt at closing each evening , which is rarely the case with other neighborhood bars . i live down the street from the place and have been there at least N-N times ( slight drinking problem here ! ) each time , i have impeccable service and my food is awesome ! i have not tried the falafel or fondue , but pretty much everything else . my burger was cooked to perfection and the blackened chicken and gnocchi was . . . for lack of a better word orgasmic . i ' m not a beer drinker , but many of my friends are and they tell me that the selections are great . i have proudly enjoyed each of their signature drinks , which are tasty and literally intoxicating . the prices are extremely reasonable . and i feel previous reviews are completely contradictory . you have complained the d cor was confusing and out of place , but then you request that the prices be displayed on the wall ? ? i would not go into a swanky uptown establishment with the hopes of seeing N . N can of pabst in chalk on the wall , so i wouldn ' t want to see it here anyway . and guys , while we ' re at it , who gives a flying fuck where a juke box is in conjunction to where you are seated ? it ' s a juke box ! ! ! it ' s sole purpose is to play songs you want to hear while you are dining drinking . i ' ll never understand the people on this site who constantly trash establishments under hidden identities instead of offering constructive criticism . i get that it ' s called " yelp " , but some complaints are so ridiculous that they become comical and i ' m unable to take any of them seriously . i nearly spit water out of my mouth when i read that comment praising the east side saloon ! ! yeah , if you were looking to leave a place with dirt on your clothes and possibly od on heroin , then i bet you do miss it . but this is a nice place that not only dressed up that old eyesore of a dive , it gives neighborhood people who have been here forever and people who have newly moved here a place to go and enjoy themselves . sorry for the rant , i just feel strongly that it ' s going to be a really great place . it ' s only been open a month and i feel they ' ve adapted quite easily . the staff is friendly and while i didn ' t notice any facial stds or other abnormalities , i did notice people who are eager to serve . 
basically a high priced upscale diner . the food is good . the staff is attentive and they serve food late . . . which is why i ' m giving them N stars . standard diner fare with a twist ! i guess you really cant go wrong here . just nothing special . 
before i even begin , shall we note that i have worked at this restaurant part-time as a hostess during my " off months " between writing gigs . if that bit of news offends you , kindly stop reading this review immediately . however , this decades-old restaurant , situated on a corner some N feet from my apartment door , is also a place i ' ve frequented as a customer over the past year . i won ' t comment on service or bartending , of which i ' m unable to be unbiased ( with both positive and negative opinions ) . but the food ? the atmosphere ? definitely worth mentioning . there are few better places to sit outside , have a drink and watch the south street oddities strolling along . i ' ve brought family here numerous times , toddler in tow , when they ' ve visited the city . it ' s been a date spot . it ' s been a place to grab lunch and read a book uninterrupted . of the food the specials are ever-changing and frequently creative . happy hour specials include heavily discounted appetizers and large pitchers of sangria or bellini . recommendations indulgent grilled cheese and tomato basil soup combination , any burger on the menu , crisp and savory empanadas and the duck tacos . vegetarians and celiacs have several items to choose from , if you ask enough questions . there are misses , to be sure , but the menu is improving . the philly beer week menu this year has been so over the top i went back twice and left heavily buzzed and giggly ( read intoxicated ) . 
authentic as it comes . designed for the desi palate ! ask them to spice it up ! the flavors are delicate and has a home made touch to it . the lamb saag is a must . so is the kadhi ! the shahi paneer is brilliant . the aloo gobi is spicy and delicious . the best gulab jamun that i have eaten in a long time . none of the top layer coming of separate like most gits made fakes . you must try the rasmalai - top draw ! you cannot go wrong with this place . 
let me start this out by saying , i am really picky , like really picky . i also never write reviews . however , every now and then it is worth my time . ) i simply love this place . the management , the staff , the food , everything is wonderful . i went today with my husband and my mother . my mother was starving . the place is very small inside , so when we were told we had to wait N minutes for a table , she was a little disappointed . i think the manager could see the disappointment on her face , so while we were waiting he brought us a small plate of bruschetta to curb her hunger . to me that instantly made us feel like family . i have never been brought food while i waited for a table . so besides that , the pizza and salads really are amazing . the sauce is awesome . we actually got a white pizza and had some sauce on the side , and it really really is amazing . i love sauce . it does rival what you get in italy . everything is fresh and yummy . oh i ' m not done . when we received the bill , the manager sent us N little cannollis on a plate . seriously , we are in kingston , nj ! try this place ! and its byob ? ? ? ? i mean really . can it get better then that ? 
we ' ve gone here twice . good , fresh ingredients that included the bread , mozzarella , tomato , prosciutto , chicken , etc . its an old school italian sandwich joint . very fulfilling , simple , yet delicious sandwiches . lucky for us , this is right around the corner . i highly recommend . 
i ' ve ordered pizza there N times and the pizza has always been awesome , but the two women at the counter who take your order are so rude to you that you don ' t feel welcome the minute you walk in the door , either ordering or picking up the pizza . 
absolutely wonderful ! great laid back place - started with a lemon zest doughnut , moved on chicken and waffles and finished with a sour cherry and pear crumble pie . great find in bk - amazing food , very reasonably priced - oh , a few local beers to choose from too . my new brunch fave ! 
i don ' t get it , why do people like this place , have they never had real chowder ? a decent grilled piece of fish ? actual lobster bisque ? high-end cafeteria food . cream and butter do not make everything better . anyone halfway competent cook can prepare a lobster or make steamers . yes the fish is fresh , but they ruin it with butter and ritz crackers . scallops shouldn ' t be cooked till they are dry . save your money . 
this review is for drinks only , as the only food i ' ve eaten there was guacamole . ( it was great , but it ' s hard to go wrong with freshly made guac . ) first , the atmosphere . the interior is fine - dark but spacious and ( as far as i could tell ) clean . it gets really noisy on weekends , but that ' s to be expected . and the patio is great . it ' s set off from the sidewalk so you aren ' t being jostled by pedestrians , and the street it faces is fairly quiet . the atmosphere is trendy and fun . best outdoor seating in new haven by a mile . the service is good . the one time they ' ve messed up an order ( they forgot to add the rum to the daiquiri . really . ) , the waitress apologized and brought a new one at no charge . plus , they ' re good about accommodating large groups . as for the drinks , they have an excellent selection of tequila . the cocktails , however , are an embarrassment . if you are going to call yourself a tequila bar , you need to be able to make a decent margarita . period . and no , the other mixed drinks aren ' t any better . i have tried a variety of drinks there on different occasions , and never - ever - had a good one . i honestly don ' t know how they do it . the fact that this so-called tequila bar can ' t even make up a passable drink means that i will not go here if i can in any way avoid it . but if it ' s warm outside and you intend to drink either beer or straight liquor , geronimo ' s is a great choice . . . . just don ' t try to order a mixed drink . 
so cheap ! ! ! how is this possible ? the food is delicious--great falafel , hummus , baba ganouj . tip eat the baba ganouj quickly as it goes bad quickly . 
awesome food . . . i love the tawa rotis . . . they do not get any better . . love the karela-okra fry . . . the mutton curries . . . the chicken curries . . . and kababs . . . i prefer eating fish the way it is made in mangalore . . but after eating the amritsari fish curry at punjabi rasoi . . . it was finger licking good . punjabi rasoi is the place to head to if you are looking for home-made punjabi food . 
had dinner with my fiance ' last night . we were able to be seated in about N minutes which was nice since the past two times we tried to get in for dinner the wait was over N minutes . being as we live in new york and often ride over to vermont we did not make reservations . so this was our first dining experience at the farmhouse . we spent our wait at the rear bar and enjoyed a glass of wine . very nice selection . and even though it was rather warm in rear bar area the bar staff was friendly . we started with the steak tar tare . this was very good and well presented . for our dinners i had the laplatte river angus farm beef burger . ordered it medium rare . my fiance ' had the pulled pork with corn bread and coleslaw special . which is served on a caste iron hot plate . why you would serve coleslaw on a caste iron hot plate i ' m not sure . anyway , our meals arrived let ' s say warm . the burger was more medium than medium rare . fries were cold on the outer edge of serving . the corn bread was cold and the pulled pork warm . i don ' t often complain about my food . but temperature is big with us . we inquired of the couple at the table next to us being that one of them had also ordered the pulled pork as to whether their food had arrived hot . they had the same issue . warm food . as the couple on the other side of us left their table i could hear one of them exclaim that they also had an issue with food temperature . we asked of the waitress as we placed our order if it was a particularly busy night ? she explained that it was a rather mediocre crowd . being as that were the case i can not imagine what temperature the food would come out on a busy night . . all in all the food had a good taste . which was the reason we did not complain . the restaurant was very noisy . and the waitstaff appears to be constantly on the run . our food arrived and within N seconds , before we even had a chance to take a bite the waitress was at the table inquiring as to our meal . which was obvious we hadn ' t sampled . and did not return . sometimes when you get that big it is hard to put out a good product at a proper temperature without proper staffing . this place seats over N including the rear bar patio area in the summer . there is a definite need for increased attention to getting the food to the tables expeditiously to ensure it arrives hot . i think i will try it during lunch just to give it a second chance . 
maybe this place was too hyped for me , but i wasn ' t all that impressed . we ordered the tasting appetizer platter and it seemed like it was just fried stuff . the cubano was decent , but not the best ever and my boyfriend ' s steak was overcooked ( well-done when he asked for rare ) . the drinks , however , were fantastic and that is what really saved the place . the price too , was a treat . 
i ' m in love with the decor and ambiance - communal tables , american flag full of religious and spiritual symbols , and arched doorways to reflect the brooklyn bridge . if you ever need to throw a party , this would be an ideal location as long as they can go vegg . great soundtrack playing and for the nostalgic videogame lovers , they had pacman . the food was excellent too - my date and i shared three mobs i can ' t remember their names but our favorite was the tofu pizza . i only wish they offered more choices , but the entire experience was excellent . giving us comic books with the menu was weird , but cute . . . . only in brooklyn . 
although a bit on the pricey side , the food and the nice selection of wines help you to forget the heavy check at least for a little while . buffalo mozz and tomatoes appetizer was nice , and also enjoyed the raviolis with sage and butter sauce . 
great place for some puerto rican food . la taza de oro has been here for well over N years and counting . the neighborhood surroundings have become gentrified but this place chugs along as if time has stood still . yes , it is small . yes , it is inexpensive and yes you will get fed . . . . large portions . so come hungry and bring friends . a casual place for some delicious food . recommended . 
this is a beautiful quaint little restaurant on a pretty street . if you ' re strolling through soho around lunchtime , this would be a great place to stop for a bite . i heard the reviews about the lamb sandwich , so i had to try it . i ' m very happy that i did . every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes , the lamb and the sauce - was delicious . these four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance . i would recommend this place to anyone . 
still the best brunch spot in philly end of story the best french toast in town every thing is great the people too
best restaurant ever . loved the service had a great night . i come very often . the owner is even a great entertainer . 
really solid mexican . i got a burrito and it was huge for a really good price . 
i go to this place quite often , despite the wait , because the food is really good , especially their banana pancakes . usually , the service is good too , but i went there today and the waitress ( whose name is cassandra , i believe ) was just not nice at all . first , she gave us the check while we were still eating and started taking away the plates away while we were literally still chewing . . . and there was no one waiting outside ! then , for a reason yet to be determined , she decided to put a N ( ! ) mandatory gratuity on the check , just for us and not anyone else . i complained about it and instead of just changing the check , she started lying blatantly to make up for her screw-up and pretended that they always do that for everybody . . . well , it was the first time for me . when i showed another waiter the check of the person seating nearby without this N automatic gratuity , they made-up another far-fetched story . eventually , when she ran out of stupid lies , she thought it was a good idea to start making fun of her costumer and started mocking me ( oh thank you so much for your business ) . i gave a N tip and left . considering how i was treated as a costumer over there , i don ' t think i will go ever again . it is not because you run a famous and successful place that you have the right to be disrespectful towards your costumers . 
the beer selection is superb . the roof deck with the fire pits is a great atmosphere bonus , i especially like it out there in the fall to sip on a good stout or porter when it is too cold ti sit outside anywhere else . the food is always delish and the service is always top of the line . 
marguerita pizza at its finest with fresh mozzarella , basil , and a crust that lombardi ' s oven is known for . pizza at its best ! cash only
delicious . cheap . fast . white sauce . what more can a girl ask for ? 
best tacos i ' ve had in brooklyn . hands down . just amazing . good prices . the staff is great ! i am so happy that they took over from oacaca . . . i could eat here every day . 
i had heard good things about stone hearth , and we decided to give it a try for dinner . so glad we did ! loved the menu , the apps and cheese tray were very good . service was excellent ! each of our entrees were also delicious ! the desserts were on the simple side , but we shared two - the strawberry trifle and the chocolate pot -- outstanding ! ! all in all a great experience - will be back soon ! 
i had high hopes good reviews and i received a glowing recommendation from a friend . however , i found the pizza to be mediocre . plus , lombardi ' s delivers to my door , which is in another league . 
had oyster po boy at pearl oyster house for lunch . what a ripoff , a measly N over fried , over salted oysters on a huge doughy hoagy roll with lettuce tomato - for N . N plus tax . not eating here again . 
i arrived at my N star rating very scientifically . N star for the boudain balls ( crawfish ) N star for the muffaletta N star for the oysters N star for the mac cheese N star for the decor we went on sunday night of their first official opening weekend . it ' s true that the wait for the food is longer than usual . so -N star for that . but then the owners and the chef and even the designer all checked on us to see how we were doing . super friendly ! so N for that , which means sugar freak gets N stars , but since yelp only goes up to N , i will give them N . my rating system is flawless . ) 
cheap , open N N , great menu ( plantain chips are amazing ) and while it is tiny , the turn around is quick and they ' re accommodating for groups . it ' s a lovely late night place to grab drinks and good food ) 
it really deserves N . N stars . it will satisfy your craving for sushi but won ' t blow you away . very good yaki udon as well . 
finally got the chance to stop during the day and enjoy my steak . love this place . i ' m new to yelp and so glad i can finally tell people how i feel about places it eat . sorry pat ' s and gieno ' s this place beats you hands down . . . can ' t wait till next night work to stop and grab dinner on the run . . . 
adding minca to my list of favorite ramen joints . the noodles are perfectly chewy and have a good tenacity to them . the spicy miso is piping hot and intense in all the right ways that soups packed full of flavor should be . the shoyu is also quite packed with flavor though not quite as intense as the spicy miso . it ' s a small hole in the wall and doesn ' t have very many seats . come off peak hours to get seated quickly . 
pretty amazing date place . has a good variety of risotto to choose from . the negative is that it ' s pretty much just risotto and not a big selection . other than that great service and pleasant atmosphere . 
the patio is by far the best thing about this place ! sitting on the rooftop drinking a cocktail or brewski is the way to do it when it is a beautiful summer night or a crisp fall day . i wouldn ' t recommend this place for the food or the service because it isn ' t stellar . when i ' ve eaten here , i ' ve been mildly disappointed though it isn ' t terrible . the service is somewhat slow and it can be difficult to get the bartenders waiters attention if it is a busy night . i really don ' t have more to say about this place other than the location is great , food is mediocre and so is the service . . . 
what a waste of time and money . i ' m Nyrs old and my friends from philadelphia had told me all my life hey we shold go to geno ' s yadda yadda for years whenever i would visit . over the last Nyears whenever the grateful dead would play the spectrum or other bands in nearby venues . i went yesterday with my girlfriend for the first time and it was the worst experience for food i have ever had . i can make a better steak sandwich myself . to be fair , the bread was ok . but the grease bomb they serve is nothing but a long stay in the bathroom awaiting you several hours later . hey i ' m all for belly bombs ( white castle comes to mind ) but it should be when expected not a result of hype and tasteless " meat " and a slop of carmalized onions . their frys , while proclaiming " freedom " are nothing but the cheapest frozen fry they can find and dump into uninspired oil . i would never reccomend this place to anyone . i ' d rather go to nathan ' s in coney island . at least what they sell tastes good ! ( one last thing . . . what is up with that hot sauce ? - it is not for the weak kneed - but man , ya gotta give warning on that - that is a present that re-presents itself upon expulsion as well ) 
this was my first time here and it was so delicious ! after running in the brooklyn half marathon , i was starving ! ! after a shower and a nap , i was craving meat ! ! my friend heard about some secret steak on their menu which ended up being a Noz porterhouse . omg , it was amazing ! ! the restaurant will slice it for you and it comes with spinach and these fried potato balls . holy cow they were yummy ! ! watch out for the potato balls though b c they ' re super hot when they arrive on the table . we also had the scallops and monkey bread . both were prepared nicely but sorry , the steak outshines them both . for dessert , the waiter recommended the cheesecake ( which i was already leaning towards anyway ) and it was so light and fluffy without an overwhelming cream cheese taste . it was a great celebratory meal and i definitely recommend everyone to try it at least once . the service was impeccable . 
classic pizza . great cheese crust combination . i would recommend it to a friend . 
despite truly delicious food , i ' m more tempted to give toby ' s N N N stars , and here ' s why i ' ve been going to toby ' s since they first opened , but sadly ( or , in the interest of my waistline , happily ) i can ' t afford to make a habit of it . the prices are just across the board too high . pizza at its most basic doesn ' t cost much to make , so is the priciness there to offset items like black truffles , or is toby ' s testing what the market will bear ? they are also cash only , a practice i was hoping would prove temporary . two years later , however , i ' m dropping a stack of twenties on pizza , which just doesn ' t feel right . most of the time . there are , of course , those " screw it , i ' ve earned this " nights where , practicality be damned , you just want to gorge on delicious brick oven fare and enjoy yourself . on those occasions , let toby be your man . just don ' t be surprised if you can ' t afford another visit for a month or so . 
the khao soi is the thing to get . the crunchy noodles soften in the curry but still maintain texture leaving you with something great . the sizzling sisig is full of fatty , crunchy , pig face and the portion is somehow almost too big . share that or just accept that your cholesterol is going to double . the shan noodles , compared to the other dishes work as more of a palate cleanser and the picked veggies balance it all out . i ' m in it to it and want to go back . def do that khao soi tho . 
it is very delicious , you should go there . . . very nice people . 
ate here a few years back . the food was pretty decent ( we didn ' t do bbq for some crazy reason ) but a little overpriced for the quantity and quality . tofu and bibimbap were both pretty good . atmosphere was nice , seems like it would be a good date style kbbq place . i ' d give them another shot , but i wasn ' t super impressed on my fist visit . 
the first time i came here i just had drinks at bettibar , which was nice and had a very cool , laidback environment . however , the restaurant itself was just mediocre . service was okay and i have to commend them on finding and bringing my gloves down to me when i returned later ( i always seem to forget something . ) the food was just so-so . i had the the hearts of romaine salad to start and i thought that the cheese overpowered the whole dish . otherwise , i think it would have been much better but there was too much to pick out . for the main course , we shared the spinach ravioli and the shrimp catalina . there was barely any shrimp ( maybe N pieces ) in the dish and the rest was all sauce . the sauce was very good and packed a punch , but sauce isn ' t a meal . the spinach ravioli was very tasty , but it ' s something even i could have made at home and i ' m not a good cook . it was also very difficult to eat since the raviolis were hidden at the bottom of the bowl under all the sauce . it was a good portion size and good comfort food , but it ' s not really what you look for when you go out to eat . go to bettibar and get food somewhere else . and as others have said , yelp , make a separate listing for it ! 
first off i would like to start by saying we have been there several time . may i also add that my wife and i had our rehearsal dinner there as well . like most places in montclair its byob . the food was amazing the owner was very welcoming and always concerned on how we were doing , which i like that about a business . like i mentioned before we have been there on different occasions we have order there pizza which i will say is great for one person . the pizza is a whole meal when i say this i mean it . you get so much prosciutto on the pizza . they also accommodated my N year old son with there amazing pasta fagiloi which he loved . may i also add that he ' s a picky eater . we also got a salad with shrimp which their shrimp were huge - none of those small little shrimp like other places give you . although it ' s main headline is pizza , the menu is full of other choices . the friendly staff is very helpful with making recommendations . each time we were here the atmosphere was lively and we really enjoyed our night out . i look forward to eating here often . 
i ' ve been going here for N years as i live around the block . now they pick and choose who they want to sit down . i was rudely kicked off a table by the asshole waiter so he can sit a large group after i waited on line . it about time i stop going to this roach infested hole anyway . 
this is great family place in downtown princeton . they have really good pizzas and our favorite is verde . the best part is they open till midnight over weekends . 
a cute , cozy place to meet a friend or date , where you could actually have a conversation if you wanted to ! super authentic in that the owners waiters obviously speak french . very easy to get a seat if you arrive early . as for the pizzas , my friend got the one with bacon and i got the salmon leek . lesson learned - always go with the bacon . the salmon leek was rather bland . i ' d stop by again if i was in the area . 
this is s typical greek diner and i ' ve been going there for N years . they recently raised prices but not quality . when i asked about it the gentleman at the register was rude and acted like i was a moron for being surprised that a meal that would have cost N . N or less a year ago is now N dollars . not going back . 
i would have said no stars but i can ' t okay so my husband calls duffys orders N cheese burgers very well done he said like a hockey puck N minutes and N bucks later it was still mooing i mean the bun was covered in blood the meat was raw really really raw not even warm i can ' t tell you how happy my dog was it was raw chop meat so gross we are never going back ewwww
i recommend mezzaluna for a good italian meal in the friendliest of atmospheres . i like my italian food simple and tasty . i had a delicious house salad , and they prepared a terrific pasta dish to my specifications . the espresso was great , a nice touch is the lemon peel to go with it , which many restaurants leave out . i come to princeton periodically to browse the labyrinth bookstore and princeton record exchange and just hang out . mwzzaluna is a great place to top off the day . 
yesterday i dined with my husband at eno terra - it was my birthday . it was not the first time that we ate there . we live on the corner - and go to your restaurant from time to time . this time - yesterday will be my last . the service that was provided was not that you advertise . we were seated in the row of small tables . you can ' t escape the flow of the energy from the tables around you . this is a given fact . and you can ' t expect that everyone will be willing to understand this . this is ok . however , after sitting at the table where i was and allowing a guy in the corner table overpowering a conversation , intruding into it the dining experience around , being loud and basically being rude - it got to me . what do you do ? you are still eating you have to put up with this crap . or maybe i should have asked to be reseated - but i did not . we left for the bar as soon as possible and as soon as we finished dining at that table . we talked to the manager . what really makes me not to go back is the answer we got from the manager . " the loud guy is our regular customer . we can ' t do anything about it . " well , if he is the regular customer , then - who am i ? you do not want to loose a regular customer , but you definitely lost me , and those who participated in the experience , but did not speak out . but i will definitely make sure that the community and the zagat environment ( if you are participating ) are aware about how the eno terra treats the non-regular customers . 
just get in when it right open ( N Nam ) . good service , fast and helpful . the noodle is not that traditional as in lanzhou china , but very good . one bowl of noodle is enough for a hungry man . may try next time ! 
this is the best chinese in the area . try the chow fun or the beef on a stick appetizer . it is a bit busy at rush hour or sunday so have patience but you will not be disappointed . take out only . 
this place is awesome . owners a great guy , atmosphere is great , and its modestly priced . i got a full meal for N and its in great neighborhood ! check it out
came here for my friends birthday and had to be rolled out ! ! ! we had the family style meal and it was amazing ! ! i was a hot mess eating the meatballs and sausage but i didn ' t care . my favorites -their pizza is amazing here ! the vodka sauce pizza was my favorite -pappardelle pasta with sausage -house salad ( so good ) 
food was terrible . waitress smelled like an ashtray . 
not that this place needs another N star review , but it really is that good . the mushroom garganelli is seriously out of this world . out of this world . the ricotta salata on top is the perfect touch . i always tell myself that i ' ll branch out and not get this dish , but haven ' t been able to not order it . too good . i agree with other ppl who say that this place likes to use salt . luckily i like salt , but i would say that a lot of the dishes are walking a fine line between being perfectly seasoned and just a little bit too salty . the orecchiette , gnocchi , octopus , crudo antipasti , fish are all great . last time i was there the table next to me got the roasted chicken and were seriously raving . i ' m definitely going to get that next time i ' m there , because they were going nuts . . . not sure how you can differentiate one roasted chicken from the next , but if i had to put money down , i ' d bet l ' artusi would know how to do it . also great for brunch - poached eggs w farro and the eggs with polenta in an amatriciana sauce are both excellent . can you tell i love this place ? 
in may , N i was lucky enough to spend some vacation time in nyc and found my way to edi the wolf in the east village for sunday brunch . i was very early for their N N a . m . opening and , before the staff arrived for work , i found a bench outside at street level to wait . within seconds of sitting , the owner arrived with coffee for me to enjoy while i people-watched . soon enough the staff arrived and i was invited into the restaurant . my point ? it would have been easy for the owner to have told me to come back at N N , but he didn ' t -- he made me feel valued and offered free coffee while i waited . nice touch of hospitality . thank you . the schnitzel sandwich was excellent and the service was beyond reproach . can ' t wait to do it all over again ! 
when you are in the village you have to stop by for the falafel sandwich . the sandwich is good and always fresh . you can decide what you want on it . i just like it plain and i am probably in the norm but the service was on point . the overall meal is somewhat expensive . 
the best falafel ever and i have tried many ! ! ! ! once you have their falafel no one else can compare . i can ' t eat any if it ' s not falafel hut anymore , i ' m always comparing . so happy to have found this place N years ago ! definitely recommend ! their falafel and sauce is the perfect blend ! ! ! mouth waters just thinking about it ! 
everything i had was delicious . as a southern transplant to central new jersey , the cuisine brings me back to living in charleston and enjoying the flavors that only an expertly trained chef in the low country can create . must try ' s are the she crab soup and the fried chicken with black bean cake appetizer . we will be back to visit soon ! 
barbuzzo would get N . N stars if possible- my wife thinks it ' s great , i was not blown away . having eaten here twice it ' s consistently ok to good - reviews suggest much more . we had the brussel sprouts which were not cooked enough for my liking . the pizzas were pretty good , but i ' ll take nomad and pitruco over barbuzzo given the opportunity . i can ' t recall most of the dishes we had which is telling . . . it may just be my taste - others are thrilled w barbuzzo where i find it noisy , crowded , and reasonably above average . 
this has become a hung-over sunday tradition for us . despite being busy , we ' re always seated quickly , the staff is always friendly and the waiters attentive . the staff also seem to know the menu well and can recommend food based on what you ' re craving . the spinach smoothie is actually really good , try it . pancakes are a little on the dense side , but that ' s an observation , not a complaint . omelettes are quite large and paired with the potatoes and bread , make a pretty big meal . the waffle has a great flavor to it , but it ' s a little too dense for my taste . sandwiches are a great size with a very good combination of sauces and quality ingredients . it really tastes like they ' re prepping it all themselves from scratch in the back and not buying presliced meats like so many other places . mixed drinks are well made , although if you ' re just here for mimosa ' s and bloody mary ' s , there ' s plenty of better places to go . hint you can double park on the right side outfront on sundays since this is where the church crowd gets permission to park . 
i ' ve been going back and back to devil ' s den over and over again . i keep finding new reasons to love it . i ' ve gone back at all times of day at this point , and i really can ' t say enough about how i love it . the service is always good , the happy hour prices are so very right . and the sunday brunch mimosas bloody mary ' s ( N each ) are well made and are the right price . i think that mostly i love the fireplace that they light up during the winter . there is nothing like the smell of burning wood and embers that i truly love . there are too many things i truly enjoy about devil ' s den . i suggest you trek here . winter , or summer , it ' s a great hole to hang out in and enjoy good drinks beer . 
i finally had a burger at village whiskey . it was delicious . it was super expensive . i may have to keep a piggy bank to save specifically for my next lunch there . allow me to elaborate village burger served on a sesame bun with lettuce , tomato and homemade russian dressing ( on the side for me ) and a pickle - N add jasper hill cheddar - N . N add smoked bacon - N . N add pickled long hots - N add about ten miles on the treadmill - ( free , with membership ) my burger quickly amounted to a whopping twenty dollars , and that was before adding on an order of duck fat fries with sly fox cheddar sauce on the side , shared with my dining companion . the meal , naturally , was over-indulgent and delicious . lunch at village whiskey is definitely a splurge , not a once-a-week occurrence . service is top-notch all around , and you ' ll feel like a baller with an expense account for an hour or so . you may even rub elbows with the likes of gary matthews at the bar , as we did the day of our visit . pro tip all the single ladies should head on over around lunch time during the work week . the male female ratio is approximately N N . 
i love that place ! 
love , love , love the changing menu and the few staples that don ' t change . innovative , tasty food with a twist . . . great staff and energetic atmosphere ! 
simple review . . . . . . . best pizza i ' ve ever tasted . 
there is one reason above all the others that makes this place stand out . ray knows how to make a good coffee . he really does . in particular i would point to two critical factors N . he knows how to steam and pour milk . this is the biggest fault of many other well-loved cafes in brooklyn . while their baristas may look and talk the part , they often don ' t really know the difference between lattes , cappuccinos , cortados , flat whites and macchiatos . many simply just produce a slightly frothy milky coffee and call it whatever name you want to hear . there is a difference . ray understands that and knows what to do . N . he keeps his machine clean . another big mistake that many cafes here in brooklyn seem to make . neglecting to keep the machine clean will inevitably degrade the quality of the finished product . this is far more important that what beans you use . even if you have some kick ass single origin with interesting tasting notes , it ' s just going to taste like any other boring old brew if the machine is not clean . if you want to go beyond choosing coffee on the basis of image and rhetoric then i suggest you give mountain province a try . 
knowledgeable staff . great wine . sexy atmosphere . to tria i will go ! 
one of the best burgers i ' ve ever had , light , delicious and cooked just right . we only had burgers and diet cokes , but it was great , really friendly atmosphere . 
what a great healthy option in this part of town ! the food is terrific ! the restaurant is fresh and bright ! loved everything we got ( basque shrimp lemon chicken steak and fig salad ) . looking forward to returning and trying other dishes ( had a bite of the " eggplant provie " sandwich and was happily surprised at how flavorful it was - i ' m not a big fan of eggplant ) ! 
wow . . . wow . . . wow ! all of the rave reviews about this cart are legit . out of all of the times i ' ve visited nyc , i ' ve never had this actual well-known cart and opted for the imitation carts instead -- and i ' ll never settle for anything less than this cart again ! after calling it an early night ( for nyc standards ) at Nam , a friend suggested to take us here . in the freezing , below N degree weather , there was already a line . people were eating outside and in their cars . i wanted to get the best of both worlds , so i tried the gyro and chicken combo over rice . like other reviewers mentioned , the white sauce is amazing . i also got the hot sauce , which was a lot spicier than i thought it would be . . . but it was still good . for only N , you get a piping hot container of succulent meat over rice . this is a must try if you ' re ever in nyc ! 
famous neighborhood brunch spot . line out the door before it opens , get there early . very crowded , traditional american style food . 
it ' s neat and different . major lack of seating . restaurants and stores with different types of foods . everyone who went with me enjoyed their meal , but it wasn ' t anything to write home about . it feels a bit like eating in a subway station , but to be fair , i ' m not much of a city person . 
this place is perfect for a good beer and good food ! just got a new chef who re-vamped the menu this past month and there is something on there for everybody . great veggie choices that are on the menu all the time , along with changing specials . menu hasn ' t been updated on the website as of N N . 
this place serves the best pizza . we were almost discouraged by the long waiting line but boy was the waiting worth our while . the pizza was simply the best and sitting where i could watch the preparation process i also had a visual pleasure . this is a place i will return to whenever i get the chance . 
i can see myself coming back for the small bites - pesce , charcuterie platters with a bottle of wine . the space is casual and lively and makes for good nibbling and drinking . for a full blown meal however , i ' d walk a few blocks somewhere else . there are too many other , insanely good options in this part of manhattan . we also tried a few pasta dishes , and a braised pork belly dish . they were nice , except i dare say , i could have cooked these dishes better myself . since moving to l . a . i ' ve taught myself to sort of cook sad but true . if i were still living in nyc , a few blocks away , it would be a different story . good restaurant , but not necessarily a destination . 
me and my wife order the margherita pizza and the banana nutella and walnut calzone . the pizza was ok . even when the ingredients are fresh , the crust is charred over the edge and too soggy in the middle . plus there is a lot of crust , than ingredients . the dessert was a different story . . . pretty good ! totally recommend . the service was just ok . our waiter was kind but he disappeared just when we wanted the check . take five minutes to returned . overall was a good experience . N . N stars if i could . i think they can do better . 
nook is okay . i went with friends on a saturday morning at Nam . we waited N minutes for a table . tip if you ' re starving , enjoy a slice of dollar slice of pizza next door while you wait . the menu is reasonable N . N for each of the scramble plates . service is also good friendly and attentive . the food , however , is not that good . you get better flavor and portions at a nearby diner . the coffee is nothing special either . then again , the price seems right , so i can ' t complain too much . a-ok . 
great beer . great service . good food . the pasta dishes are a surprise and a great value . the mussels are another highlight . stay with the safer pizzas ( margarita , plain white , gaaahlic and gabagoo ) and you can ' t go wrong . the staff is top notch - informative , on the ball and friendly ! 
made reservation for N . so disorganized had to wait outside for table for over a half and hour after reservation made with an N month old baby . don ' t think i would bother coming back here again and i didn ' t even tried the food yet . ended up with even a sunday brunch menu . waiter was great and did his best to try to make up for all the other mistakes . manager did come over to express his concern and apologized . even treated the table to appetizers . truly impressed . was my first time at that bone fish . mistakes can happen but seeing someone take responsibility and being helpful changes a bad experience to a great one
this place is so ah-mah-zing ! ! ! i went with my boyfriend because i work in the area , and it never disappoints . the pizza is unbelievable and the portions are not hog portions . the appetizers ( i had the pate ) , pizza and pasta is some of the best i ' ve had in the city . not to mention , they have a good beer selection which is hard to find . overall worth every single penny ! ! 
the service is horrible--snotty young kids who make a number of mistakes ( like forgetting to put in my order ! ) and then even have an attitude about their mistakes . their fried calamari is decent . their marghuerita pizza is awful . made me sick so i threw away what was left of it . too bad . this area needs a good italian restaurant--but they ain ' t it . 
i like this place . it ' s often crowded , but if you don ' t mind eating a bit later ( after N N or so ) , you can usually walk in and get a table pretty quickly on weekends . the pork buns are one of my favorites as well as the spicy pork with rice cakes . some of the other items are a bit lacking in my opinion . last time i ordered the corned beef , which reminded me of a slice of spam . the quail was ok , but i ' m not a big fan of game birds anyhow . portions are small , but if you build your meal around the pork buns and spicy pork dish , you ' ll get plenty of food for your money . all around , a good place to eat with cool staff . 
dumplings ! ! the dumplings are perfect on their own , with sauce . took my girlfriend there , she loved it . thing was service was slow . 
had a late brunch ! food is solid . service is good . 
my husband and i came here in the late afternoon on a saturday and while the place was bustling , we didn ' t have to wait for a table . we had the special - pig ' s ear salad - followed by pickles and the devils on horseback ( bacon wrapped prunes stuffed with poached pears ) . then we each had a satisfying burger . i also had the salty dog ( grapefruit infused vodka with grapefruit juice with a pinch of salt ) , which was both healthy and dangerous b c i could ' ve had about five of these . given the hype that the spotted pig has received , i was really expecting a certain type of place . but what i experienced very pleasantly was a low-key but busy , friendly " neighborhood " kind of place that catered not just to the hip and young . it made me miss new york a little . 
delicious , interesting , very fresh , great service . the scallops and the mariscada ensalada were fabulous ! 
one of the best crepe i ever had
food was good but the service was horrible . they wanted us to order food even before getting us the water soda . asked for wine glasses and they got us the wine glasses after the food was served . they didnot put crushed pea-nuts on pad thai . when asked , they said , they didn ' t have any . they added N tip even though we were only N in our group . never seen a thai place where rice is not included in a N curry order . my wife thought the curry was extremely spicy . . . . and we are indians , used to spicy food . when we told about it , they did not do anything about it . 
food was delicious ! the lobster risotto was so good i had to go back and order it again later in the week . service was amazing friendly , too . 
this was my second time to garces trading company and i got the tasting menu . i thought the charcuterie cheese course was phenomenal . i always love that . the next course was also good , although the artichoke was not the great . i thought it was bland . although the cauliflower in the fermented garlic and pesto sauce was great . the main course was also mixed . my boyfriend really liked the cannelloni but i thought it was blend again . however we both hated the pork chops . it was so dry that i had problems cutting it . i tried an end piece hoping it would be juicier but the fat was just rubbery . i just had higher expectation for garces . this is not an isolated instance because we went there last time and got the pork chops in the tasting menu , it was pretty dry too . the desert was good and standard . the environment and the service was really nice . although some of the tasting menu wasn ' t great , i would still go back and order a la carte . 
after dining at stephen starr ' s continental ( midtown location ) several times both for brunch and dinner , and every time being extremely underwhelmed ( N-N stars ) i wrote off his restaurants for good . overpriced for ok food was my reasoning . my friends would continuously try to get me out to el vez or buddakan or il pittore and my response was a quick and abrupt , no . i swore , never will i ever to any stephen starr restaurant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and then i ate my words . my fiance surprised me with reservations to buddakan for my birthday which was a mixed reaction for me . we have heard nothing but amazing reviews about this restaurant , however , knowing how much i hated stephen starr restaurants , he didn ' t want to take me out there to be disappointed again and prove my point that stephen starr restaurants are over rated . there were no issues being sat and we were greeted immediately by a very friendly hostess who offered to take our coats . as she walked us to our table , she did ask if we were dining for a special occasion , which we were , my birthday . our seats were on the first floor towards the back and was set just for two people . my fiance ' s drink " was amazing " and my wine recommendation from our server ( who was fantastic ) was perfect . our dim sum orders arrived ( general tso and chicken ginger ) in a timely manner and the food was hot and delicious . our entrees ( bbq pork and duck ) were amazing . each bite tasted better than the previous and we couldn ' t find anything that wasn ' t perfect with each order . i wouldn ' t change a thing , add anything , or take anything away from the dishes . each one we ordered was perfect , literally perfect . perfect execution , perfect presentation , perfect size portion , perfect temperature , perfect taste , perfect texture . . . i could go on for hours . the side of wasabi mashed potatoes still has me speechless . words really can ' t describe how glorious they were . they were spicy yet soft and fluffy and irresistible . our server made sure our water glasses were never empty and did a great job explaining the menu and recommending food and drink pairings . assuming that the desserts had to be amazing based on our previous dishes , we decided to order dessert and continued to be nothing but amazed . the donuts were unbelievable . i mean , they were warm and coated perfectly with just the right amount of sugar . each dipping sauce paired , again , perfectly with the donuts . i am still amazed at the meal , ashamed i judged his restaurants so harshly based on a few bad experiences at one ( N ) of his other establishments , and happy to have had and experienced the best birthday dinner ever . thank you buddakan for making my birthday dinner perfect . we will be returning . 
you must try the bacon grease popcorn . amazing ! the food was good - i had the ribs and vegan slaw . great beer choices . the waiters were all super friendly , too ! 
even with the service being so-so , the food more than made up for it . as an appetizer , we had the tostada de atun , nothing short of incredible . the combination of watermelon and tuna is amazing . dinner or snack , the tacos are excellent . pork belly , tongue , shrimp . . . all great . for dessert , a house-made churro dipped in chocolate . yum . we will have to go back for entrees , but nothing disappoints . sit at the bar if you can , to watch a great presentation . 
this is actually a great place for very very small groups ( N people max ) . their burritos are decent ( though mostly overrated ) , their fried pickle chips are admittedly amazing , and their margarita pitchers are the real reason i ever used to go there . try to get there for happy hour or after Npm because the pitchers are half off . it ' s also very vegan vegetarian friendly . they ' re a lot more accommodating when they have their outdoor seating open , otherwise you could be stuck there for hours just waiting to be seated . i used to love this place . . . until this weekend , when some friends and i came here . there were N of us ( which is understandably a lot ) , and they looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for a table . it was a beautiful night , and all of their outdoor benches were lined up outside , but for whatever reason they refused to seat us . i get that it ' s popular and gets packed , but they could lose the attitude . we walked across the street to gunner ' s run , got seated immediately , had an amazing dinner , and dropped about N that el camino lost out on . i work at a cafe in old city , so i get that places have their ' off ' days , but places like el camino in the nolibs area . . . need to seriously calm down . 
my N stars are based on my imagination ! ! have been to nyc N times in the past N years and have never gotten in to rao ' s , . . . so i bought their cook book ! i have used it regularly and everyone loves the dishes i ' ve created from their guidance . we ' ll be back and hopefully one day , we ' ll get a reservation ! ! loved reading all the comments ! 
loved the ambiance and the food was astounding ! ! ! ! coming back in september for a business lunch ! ! ! ! 
small place but excellent food at decent prices . we always come here if we are yearning for filipino food . love their krispy pata and bibingka . staff are friendly and attentive . 
i went there with N friends last saturday for brunch and their prix-fixe menu was really good for N . the decor is really mediterranean and slick . our waiter , mark , served us with class and charm . mabrouk mr . massoud ! 
great place ! a friend of mine invited me to dinner stix after reading good reviews on dailycandy . com . we checked it out last saturday night and it was a win ! the food was super fresh and the atmosphere was clean and sleek . i had an order of the tuna and chicken stix , the greek salad ( a real greek salad , sans lettuce ! ) and the spicy cheese dip . i was impressed with everything we ordered . since the restaurant is still fairly new the chef came by to ensure a well cooked meal and was extremely kind . the manager would occasionally check in and thanked us for dining there . the people are friendly , the staff is great and the food is even better . the best thing about stix , aside from the food , is the price . they could charge more for their stix and other dishes because of the quality ingredients they use but everything on the menu is priced reasonably . try the st . tropez cocktail too ! yum ! 
been there twice . . . food is great , service isnt as good . a little pricey for bad waiters . 
a great romantic gem in the west village . atmosphere a , food b , service b . good surprise with the asparagus risotto . 
great food and great portions . came here with my cousin and sister after being out and about in philly . we each had a cheesesteak , a small personal pizza to share and some fries . everything came out great and the service was quick . everyone here was super friendly . will definitely come back
sometimes , it takes loyal locals to keep an out of the way place thriving . thats the case with inatteso . here ' s my beef with the place N ) how the heck do you pronounce the name ? in-gnat-tezzo ? ? ee-not-tesso ? N ) how the heck do you find this place ? i only found the place because my dad lives around the corner and he wanted to eat pizza real bad . if it werent for that rare chance ( its a super rare chance because my dad is old-school chinese man , and those folks usually dont get cheese pizza cravings ) . so basically , if my dad didn ' t show me where it was , i would ' ve a- never find it b-never even know it existed . together we had N peach sangrias N small barese pizza , N arugula salad , N pasta dish w chicken sausage and N tiramisu . the salad was pretty huge . i basically ate that , a slice of pizza and a taste of my dad ' s pasta and i was fullll . it was layered on top of thinly sliced cured ham and garnished with slices of ripe peach . it was sliiiiiightly over dressed , but theres absolutely nothing to complain about . the pizza is not the best pizza in the new york . however , with ny ' s famous pizza greats , being really good amongst the greats is still an achievement . tastyyyyyyy the pasta only had one bite , but still liked it a lot ! sorry folks , not much to go on the tiramisu solid . nothing phenomenally new or original with this one . but sure nailed it . with the nice decor and great waitstaff , i ' d def . come here again , btw- the waitress knew my dad ' s name ( its not like hes a big tipper or a big boss around town ) . i believe the restaurant thrives off of loyal customers who live in the neighborhood . hats off to you guys ! 
though chop shop is located slightly out of the way for the non-chelsea dwelling crowd , here you ' ll find a cozy nook that ' s got an interesting take on some solid asian fusion . both thai and chinese influences lead to a lot of yummy dishes that combo some great flavors . we came here shortly after they opened and had not gotten their liquor license yet , but they graciously suggested places nearby where we could grab some beers or wine to bring in and have with our meal . the one downside is that the portions are on the small side so you ' ll want to order several plates to fill you up . overall we were met with a generally friendly staff who were happy to talk about their new menu and provide us with some suggestions . as an added bonus for the spring summer months , they have a nice outdoor garden space in back . datenitenyc
on a cold weekend evening i want comfort food . we were in greenpoint for an art show and i suggested polish food . large platters of warm , belly-filling meat and potatoes sounded wonderful when it was overcast and the air was thick with moisture and threatening rain . lomzynianka is quite a character . if lomzynianka were a person , it would be that loopy aunt who you weren ' t quite sure was really crazy , or simply putting on an act and knew more than anyone else about what was going on . i don ' t know what it is with eastern european restaurants , but they seem to have a penchant for christmas lights year round . along with the lights , random stuffed animal heads were on the walls . other kitschy decorations are strewn about , as if someone had absentmindedly set it down and then forgotten about it . depending upon how you feel about tsotchkes , you ' ll love it or hate . i fell madly with in love with the sanity . lomzynianka is nothing fancy . it ' s straight up home style cooking with no pretense , and certainly no high falutin ' plating . the food is literally plopped onto the plate and served to you . they don ' t even try . i love it . i was feeling gluttonous , so we ordered fried potato cheese pierogies , which comes with caramelized onions , cabbage rolls , and beef goulash . the latter two are dinner entrees , so they came with mashed potatoes . this was seriously too much food for two people . we easily could have eaten well and stuffed ourselves with only the pierogies and one of the dinner entrees ( and maybe ordered a small vegetable side ) , but we put in a herculean effort and managed to consume most of it . the pierogies were delicious little pockets of carbs and fat . thick skin , fried crisp , with a warm dollop of rich , creamy potato and cheese . these were excellent pierogies . all dinner entrees come with a small salad that consists of lettuce , random bits of vegetables , and various pickled vegetables . i like the pickles . a lot . to the point where i stole the other pickles . technically i did ask for permission , but the pickle was already on my fork and on its to my mouth when i asked . the cabbage rolls are monstrously huge . filled with beef and rice and barely shroud in a cabbage leaf . they were languorously lying on the plate . it ' s a simple dish , but very very comforting and sticks to your ribs . the beef goulash had tender pieces of meat soaking in the beautiful gravy . again , really simple , but comforting and hearty . the only item that i didn ' t like was the mash potatoes . the mash potatoes were like wet cement . very thick and heavy . it set onto the plate like cement and i ' m pretty sure i could have glued bricks with it . i like my mash potatoes on the thicker , creamier side ( not so fond of purees ) , but this was too thick . i needed the sauce from the goulash to loosen up the mashed potatoes . but on the whole , this was a minor quibble compared to the goodness of the other parts of our meal . all this delicious came under N per person . with tax and tip so cheap ! and seriously if we had skipped an entree , we would have paid N for all that food for dinner ! this is a bargain ! all i say is , " more borscht , please . " 
as soon as the door opens to minetta tavern , a strong smell of meat sweeps through the air . a wonderful deep odor . i ' m giving minetta N stars not because the food is bad , quite the contrary - everything is super tasty but for the price and for the hype , i ' ve had better . with that in mind , this is my seconwe thoroughly enjoyed the cote de beouf which is enough for N people to share , the black label burger which is super juicy and flavorful as well as the pasta zaza ( a good carb to go with the cote ) . the spinach was ok , the fries were good and even if you don ' t have room , make sure you order dessert . both the nougat and the souffles were delicious ! 
i love this place ! every time i go here , the food is delish and the service is good . this past weekend i went with a friend of mine for brunch . i had some sort of cheesy potato-y dish with eggs , and their version of a bloody mary . it was awesome . i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
worst experience i have ever had ! ! ! ! ! ! delivery guy was disorganized , took N dollars from my fiance then went to get the soda and said that he cant break change in a broken- english . so he took money from confused on what was going on my fiance gave him another N . gave N dollars back instead of N . so confused and rushing we did not realize what had happen till the next morning . they did not answer the phone at Nam when it " says " there open , took N minutes to call them . he left a message and the guy never called back . N minutes later we called again and my fiance finally got a hold of someone , but they hung up in this face when he asked if he got the message all he got was " no . . . click " . so called back and he took info down said call back ( never did ) . so they guy " scott " said he call the manager and driver at this time to figure it out . ten minutes later the driver ( that speaks another type of english ) starts to get aggressive with him while his N year old was in the other room ( real nice by the way ) . so he changed his story N times while talking to him , and then finally leaves . so we called back like " scott " said to do at N . and the " manager " saying there too busy and we are lying anyway to leave him alone and he doesn ' t care , and to call the cops because he refuses to do anything . the manager name is ien , and we says he " talked " to his driver . so to fallow a police report we would need to drivers name which he couldn ' t not provide because " he didn ' t know who the driver was . so upset that i lost N dollars because someone cant be truthful about N dollars , and the manager being a ass . i wrote this to let everyone know that they don ' t give a fuck if someone doesn ' t know how to count and confused customers it " doesn ' t bother his business is the words manager said . it ' s N days before christmas and i am down N because in there words " they don ' t have time and they don ' t care " . . . . this was also my first time ordering from these people , and never again and there general tso was way over cooked . 
i ' m in between N and N stars but i ' m studying for finals and in a bad mood so N it is ! the pros - lots of interesting ingredients - large , eclectic menu - good ambiance the cons - service was mediocre at best - we asked the server how many small plates he ' d recommend for our group of N - one man , and two small women . . . he suggested N-N main dishes per person which was easily twice as much as was actually needed . . . not sure if he was trying to up-sell or he just had no idea what was reasonable ( we ended up ordering N main dishes , the tomato bread and a side of patatas bravas which was more than enough ) - the table is incredibly uncomfortable - there is a cubbie type space under the table where they keep the water glasses , but i am not sure what the purpose of it is except to prevent people from being able to cross their legs under the table - not a huge fan of the mussels and bone marrow ( particularly the bone marrow , which was overpowered by a disgusting-looking and quite tasteless green sauce ) . 
my best friend and i decided to go for lunch one day because i saw that it got a lot of good reviews on yelp . . . this is another instance where yelp has failed me . . . we got seated after a N min wait which wasn ' t that bad because we walked over to clinton street bakery and the wait was over an hour and N mins ( there is a good yummy reason why the wait over there is that long ) . we each ordered iced coffee and it was just really bland and watered down . then we waited over N mins for our food to arrive - i timed it because after N mins we were about to walk out . the server ' s excuse was that they were busy . yes , i see that it was busy and i also see that tables that arrived after us had gotten their food and was about to pay . so . . . i don ' t know what happened there and i was annoyed , hungry and irradiated . then it was clear to me that she didn ' t put the ticket through and after our food arrived she didn ' t come by once to check up on us and we had to ask another server for a steak knife and ketchup for our potatoes . also my best friend ' s toast order was wrong so we had to get someone else to bring her the correct toast . once the food finally arrived , my steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned nicely . the eggs were a little runny for scrambled eggs so i wasn ' t too pleased with that . would i come back ? oh , hell no ! after waiting around for so long and crappy customer service , i rather wait the hour at clinton ' s or there ' s two other places around the corner that i can go to ! 
love their tuesday deal with guinness and oysters ( N for a pint and N oysters ) , plus live irish music ! ! hard to beat ! the only drawback was the service was a bit slow and we waited a while for our water glasses to be filled , even after asking our server numerous times . it was okay though , the music kept us entertained while we waited . 
terrific ! went there tonight for the first time with my inlaws and kids ( ages N and N ) , and the food was amazing and service was wonderful ! they couldn ' t have been more hospitable , and the food was just wonderful - try the soups , the ribs and the ravioli - all beautifully presented and delicious . terrific to see another wonderful place occupy this space . well done ! 
great place . keep up the good work ! ! ! ! 
welp , i knew where i was going but i didn ' t see a sign outside , but once i saw the books through the glass i knew it was the place . upon entering the restaurant it was loud and there wasn ' t a greater so i didn ' t know if we sat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us . we took the liberty of just sitting down . . . we we ' re waiting for our waiter but there was no waiter so we had to go the the bar to order our food . the food came quick . i ordered the sky burger ( turkey ) it was tastee ! the salad was drenced in salad dressed so it was a tad bit tart but bearable . . overall is was a ok experience . it was very loud and they were setting up for free karaoke so it added more to the noise . . . would i go back again . ? ? no i wouldn ' t . 
i came here for a late brunch with my bf yesterday and absolutely loved it . after numerous trips to green eggs , sabrinas , honey ' s and others , all which are great , we were in the mood to try someplace new . i had the savory crepe special of the day - with ham , cheddar , and a sunny side up egg surrounded by hollandaise sauce . i cleaned my plate . bf was starving , so he had two breakfasts - a waffle with nutella and strawberries , and two overeasy , perfectly cooked eggs with two pieces of french bread toast and finely chopped potatoes . he also cleaned his plate , with a little help from me on the waffle . the coffee was quite tasty and service was superb . the atmosphere has a great chill vibe , where you feel like you would be comfortable coming in by yourself with a good book , with a date or a group of friends . best of all , the prices were cheap ! nothing over N - the way breakfast food should be . i highly recommend the new brunch spot chhaya . check it out ! 
grand apizza has my favorite pizza in new haven , hands down . i work right down the street from them and frequently order take out . i have sang their praises for their pizza , but now it is time to do so for their service and their generosity . i manage the library branch that is near their location and i asked if they could make a donation for a end of the summer party we were having for local kids who participated in our summer reading program . george , the owner was so nice and donated N pizzas for our program . the pizzas were delicious ( of course ) , ready on time , and they even helped me to my car ! i highly recommend grand apizza for fantastic pizza and wonderful , kind service . 
eat with your hands wednesday thursday nights . fun ! if you ' re filipino then you ' ll appreciate the kamayan ! weird good experience for those who aren ' t filipino . make sure you have a group of hungry people because the food is a lot and to some , can be overwhelming ! of course , you choose your food ahead of time w your reservation . it is all traditional filipino food such a beautiful presentation . if you ' re on a diet , consider putting your diet on hold for one night , otherwise don ' t bother ! a bit pricey at least N person to include tip , but the experience is worth it . table is covered with banana leaf , followed by a row of rice , and on the rice ( nicely presented ) is your appetizers entrees . i attended on N different occasions , both with different food . appetizers included longanisa ( sweet savory garlic sausage , my fave ! ) , lumpia shanghai ( fried egg rolls ) , puto pancake ( lightly sweetened rice cake ) , cucumber tomato salad , chichiron ( pork rinds ) . my favorite entrees included the whole fried fish , chicken adobo , bicol express , ribs , pretty much all of it ! you get your side of " suka " vinegar to dip your meats lumpia in , very traditional even with the sili in it . apparently some of the things we ordered ( pinakbet shrimp ) were not served due to unavailability on that night . in place of that we had the fried fish , and cucumber onion salad , which were not disappointing ! utensils came out for dessert ( which is included in the kamayan ) halo-halo , which means " mix . " shaved ice w milk , colorful coconut jelly , sweet beans , a piece of flan , and most importantly ( to me ) the ube ( taro ) ice cream ! service is friendly , the owner is usually always there when we come . sat at the bar once for dinner ( not for kamayan ) , ordered a few drinks that included calamansi and bitter melon . hip-hop r b N ' s jams on play made the experience even better . 
reading some of the reviews for p-vetri reminds me why i despise yelp reviewers so much ( myself included ) . " N-star food , N-star service , N-star music ( bad , loud rap ) , so i ' ll give this a N star " ? " floppy pies " ? it ' s neapolitan for goodness sake . the dough , sauce and mozz on the margarita were exquisite and worth every single penny . here ' s a thought , go to see some modigliani the barnes and mosey over to this gem for some al fresco delights . 
good ole southern food . the closet to the southern cooking style you will get in nj . love it
we live around the corner from le p ' tit paris and have had dinner there about once a month since they opened . excellent food . attentive and friendly service . very comfortable and nice setting . our only complaint is that the tv is turned on during dinner service . this detracts ( albeit only slightly ) from the atmosphere but i recommend the restaurant highly . 
it ' s sure is tiny in there . the food is great . i would recommend the famous corn . good quality and a nice change of pace from the other restaurants around the area . 
the one was for our server who was good . no stars for the food . my pancakes were cold i asked for egg and cheese . the cheese was plopped on top of my eggs not cooked in . . when i informed them they offered me cake . why would i want cake ? it was my first time there and will be my last . very very disappointed . 
try their milk beer , which tastes like adult chocolate milk . 
dar N has allowed me to continue my months of winter hibernation with some delicious delivery . they are quick and prompt , and have yet to get my order wrong , which is a feat . the falafel is really good very crispy on the outside . the grilled chicken is equally as good a nice charred - lemon flavor without being the least bit dry . platters come with a generous salad , hummus and baba ghanoush , and pita . plus they usually give you tatziki and a green cilantro sauce on the side . everything is fresh and well made perfect sustenance for long , dark , sundays lost to hbo series watching ( grilled meats for your game of thrones watching pleasure , anyone ? ) 
i just used this venue for a work event for N people and couldn ' t be happier with the result ! being in california , i was nervous to choose a location in ny without visiting it first . i was drawn to bea because of the great location and the lovely pictures online . when i reached out to the owner , he was extremely helpful and accommodating . he even forwarded additional pictures for me to look at . leading up to the event , the owner answered all of my questions quickly and provided me with any additional support that i needed ( someone to work the door and check ids , slideshow capabilities , appropriate signs and a registration table for check-in ) . during the event , we had open bar and passed appetizers . all of the appetizers were amazing ! they were so delicious and i never once had to ask for more food to be passed . the entire staff was really on top of it and made sure every guest had food and drinks . the event was going so well that we decided to extend it for an extra N minutes and the owner made sure to accommodate us . after the party was over , my friends and i stayed to have a few drinks and try a few other items from the menu . ( i definitely recommend the mac and cheese , it ' s delicious . ) not only was this a great place for a large party , it was also had a great atmosphere for a smaller group . i would definitely recommend this place for any sort of party , big or small , or even for a quiet dinner . this was my second time in new york and i ' ve explored several different restaurants each time . this was by far the best location atmosphere food service i ' ve had in ny . i will definitely use this venue again in the future . 
coming to bianca ' s on a wednesday around N Npm , i put in a reservation for a friend and i . having to wait for the friend to actually arrive to be seated , i waited for N minutes before she arrived . not even N minutes later , the hostess seated us in the packed restaurant . upon sitting down , we ordered N app ( mussels ) , N chicken entrees ( pollo al balsamico and straccetti di manzo ) , bottle of white wine and desert ( tiramisu ) , which came out to just under N with tax and tip . not only is this place a bargain but the food is just delightful . the food comes out quickly and the service is outstanding . our wait was about N minutes but as we left , the average weight had to be about N minutes . i have to say it is quite worth it though . 
a friend and i were deciding to go to either parc or rouge for lunch on a nice saturday a few weeks ago , and we should have chosen parc instead . we were seated quickly in the right corner near the back . the first thing i noticed was how gross the drapes to my left were . the drapes and the walls were stained and disgusting . i was shocked to say the least . the service was also very lacking . the waitress didn ' t seem like she cared , and only came to the table once after we got our food , and that was to deliver the check . we decided to get a few small plates to share . i got the bibb lettuce endive salad , which was tasty and more plentiful than i thought it was going to be . my boyfriend got the seafood trio , which literally had N shrimp , N scallops , and N mussels for N and was somewhat salty . the third plate we got was the cheese plate . the cheeses were decent , the grapes were excellent ( probably because they didn ' t make them ) , but the froofy raisin bread was so-so , and i wish there had been more . N slices of bread for N-N cheeses is not enough . i have to say i was not very impressed by rouge . the prices were just too high for the quality of food , the ambiance , the service , etc . the only way i ' d go back is to have him try one of their supposedly great burgers ( i see everyone on yelp is raving about them ) . i would go for one , but i don ' t eat red meat . 
very original place ! the food comes in a clear bag and they give you gloves , utensils for sea food and even a bib ! which you ' ll find very handy when you eat a lobster full of sauce out of a bag . i had the lobster shrimp combo for N which i find a little pricey but their lobsters are tasty and everything mix together in their special sauce was divine . if you don ' t eat seafood like my husband you will be disappointed by their alternative . it was dry and not good . i also regret they are cash only and also be prepared to wait a long time to be placed
i ' ve decided to pick totto ramen as my first yelp review among many others because this is the best ramen place i ' ve tried so far in nyc . i am a huge ramen person , and totto has what i am looking for-- great taste , reasonable price , and good portion . i ' d recommend totto spicy ramen and totto miso ramen . here ' s a tip on totto miso ramen-- it comes with a scoop of miso bean paste topping . i ' d put that aside and add only what is needed , simply because you can taste and enjoy the broth better . . . plus , it ' s way too salty to mix it all in . i ' ve also been told recently by another yelper that you can choose between straight or curly ramen . to customize your ramen even further , ask for spicy oil on the side to add some heat . of course , with any great places to eat , you ' ll have to wait . . . and i mean wait ! average wait time for me in the past-- somewhere between N-N hours . i wouldn ' t recommend going there with more than N people , or they will have to split you into different tables . 
great margaritas ! service is a little slow , get the blackened chicken fajitas
why can ' t i rate this higher than N stars ? if i could , i ' d give it N stars . hands down , best cheesesteak of my life . forgot all the touristy spots - this is the place to be . it comes in either half size or whole size , the latter of which can definitely feed a small third world village . the half is served on a foot-long deliciously soft italian hoagie while the whole is about two feet in length . i ordered mine with whiz , american cheese , grilled mushrooms , hot peppers , sweet peppers , and onions . i ' ve never had beef so juicy and flavorful . also loved that they were bumping nicki minaj and other hip-hop songs on full blast like it was a club . i ' ll be coming back fo mo fo sho . 
always open to try a new restaurant on our frequent trips to nyc , so on a recommendation i got a last minute reservation . we did have to wait about N minutes for our table the place was packed on a tuesday night . some guy kept interrupting the hostess about his table , and from the gist of it i don ' t think he had reservations . they kept trying to tell him they had to seat the people with reservations first , but he was having none of it and kept coming back and taking up her time arguing . they did a good job of keeping their cool . we were seated in a table against a long booth seating on one side , so they pull out the table for you to sit down and then slide it back in . ( no going to the loo , or at least till you leave ) . we skipped the appetizer since the dinners seemed to be a good size ( and probably rich ) so we gorged on the fresh baked bread with our drinks . i ordered the duck comfit which was moist and delicious , the sauce was rich with wine and full of mushrooms . it also came with these slivers of potatoes almost like chips . my cousin ordered the steak frites and i tasted the steak , very tender and wonderful fries ! husband ordered some pork chop thing that was huge ! he said delicious , but i skipped on a bite there since i don ' t do pork . . . . i ' ll take his word on it . service was great and we shared a chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream . . . . wowie wow so amazing . . . the kind of " can i lick the plate " ? good . the bill for three dinners and a desert with one round of drinks N . only draw back was the noise level . maybe other parts of the restaurant aren ' t so loud but sitting right in the middle it was hard to even hear the person on the other side of the table . definitely a treat , glad we got a chance to go
i heard about the grand opening from my coworker so we went by together and they had an amazing variety of foods . my coworker and i went recently after work and there ' s no doubt , room N has the best tasting white wine sangria . i definitely recommend this place for some great food . i will be stopping by really soon with my girlfriend . 
my office colleagues come here quite often for lunch , so i am well familiar with their menu and service . would agree with the other reviews who noted that the thai food is probably their weakest area . their malaysian food is not bad , but seems diluted compared to he penang in philadelphia . in my many times there , have not experienced the rudeness from the waitstaff that some others have described , but would add a special comment about the manager . i was joining my colleagues for lunch there recently , and arrived early . my compact car was parked near the restaurant entrance . i was still sitting within the parked vehicle ( which i might add was safely within the parking space lines which are big enough to accommodate the largest suv ) replying to an email when i felt my vehicle move . i looked in the rear view mirror to see an old minivan behind me the driver was in the process of backing up after bumping my car . i got out of the vehicle to inspect for any damage . i recognized the driver as the restaurant manager , who did not apologize but tried to push by me to get to the restaurant . fortunately there was no damage . as my N colleagues arrived for lunch , we received our food in good order . the waitstaff was professional . during the meal , before all the food was served , the manager presented my boss with the check . i must add that while this is considered less than polite in the us , this is considered extremely rude in most countries in asia . the manager certainly knew this ( and my boss is also of asian descent ) but didn ' t seem to care . i should note that the restaurant was only half full , so we were certainly not hoarding up tables needed for other customers . in summary decent food but rude manager who probably should not be allowed to drive . if you plan to come here , park you car well away from any old tan minivans with a dented front new jersey license plate ! ! 
really really like the pizza ordering all the time . . . . . . . . . . . . . o ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) 
love the owner andrew , he makes me feel at home everytime i come . pretzels and meatballs are good austrian soul food . 
the best italian food i have had to date , real authentic . very small and crowded , but well worth it . must have the hot roast beef with free mozz . 
went there earlier with friends and although small , the food was really good . i got the lamb curry sandwhich , spicy , and it was actually spicy ! being caribbean , it ' s very disappointing when foods say spicy and they aren ' t ( which happens too frequently ) so i was impressed by the lunch in the sandwhich . very small so wouldn ' t recommend planning on getting a table , but worth it . plus lunch special comes with free drink and snack for like a buck more . 
pleasantly surprised . held my daughters communion party upstairs and had a great experience . staff was very friendly and food was great ! our guests had a choice of N meals and they were all fantastic . i highly recommend here for any party suitable for N-N people . also have had the breakfast here and is great as well . thank you ladies for making our girls ' day special ! 
i love this place . if you are in the mood for a gourmet pizza , this is the place to go . the old smokey is unbelievably delicious . the owner is often there making pizzas and tending the register himself which is good to see . there isn ' t a ton of seating but they do set out tables on the sidewalk and most of the time , i ' d take it with me anyway . 
i ' m always here yet i never review . i ' m so terrible . i love nam phuong ! there are so many food items that i could write about but i guess i ' ll just start with my most recent meal . - bo luc lac yummy ! one of those dishes that i order almost every single time i ' m there . -ground shrimp - sugarcane w rice paper a great starter ! it ' s just so so tasty . -pho tai it was decent , but not something i would think to order here . my friend wanted it so i decided to give it a try . come here if you want cheap authentic viet food . until next time . . . 
came here for drinks for a friend ' s b-day party . tried the mango martini ( i thought was delicious but my other friends thought it was strong - but no complaints about that from me ! ) , the kir royale ( super good , tastes like juice ) , and the lychee mimosa ( also pretty good but i preferred the kir royale ) . the manager was super friendly and even bought a few us birthday cake shots . they ' re so good ! they even top them with whip cream . . . definitely recommend asking for it ! the place got really crowded around midnight on saturday ( again though there was a b-day party being hosted there ) . the bar does take up half the space of the room . the music was really loud and it was super duper hot in the back . i took a few breaks in the front just so i could cool down . overall though the place is pretty good and it ' s def worth trying the delicious drinks ! 
the vibe here is very kumbaya-vegan-yogi meets bad biker boys meets the cleavers . they all converge , depending on the time of day , on a fantastic patio along with everyone else in between . the mexican corn is everything . i mean everything . roasted corn with tasty burned bits , cheese , lime and spices that leave your lips tingling like a plumping lip gloss . unfortunately , i ' m not too impressed with the tacos , which are very small ( even for tacos ) , and come with minimal fixins ' . the steak taco was somewhat chewy . the frozen mixed drinks remind me of kool-aid slush and pixy stix . the line is always way too long and some of the prices are completely out of whack compared to the food portions . and they only take cash . people seem confused by the second habana right across the street . and apparently you can ' t order from the small one across the street and take your food to the other big habana with a patio . i can ' t tell you how many people i witnessed in one day repeatedly crossing the street between the two habanas asking questions because they were trying to beat the long line at the big habana . 
i left fette sau feeling like i ' d gotten scammed out of N . first impression the atmosphere is super cool and with big picnic tables and tons of outdoor seating and the vibe feels like you are in a cabin in the woods or a summer camp for grown ups . i wasn ' t terribly hungry , so i asked for the smallest slice of brisket possible ( which is apparently a thick N Nlb slice ) and a bacon walnut brownie . they served me a slab of meat and brownie on a metal tray with parchment paper , which was sort of fun in a no-nonsense kind of way . i ordered the N glass of chardonnay because i felt like splurging and was poured literally the smallest glass of wine in history . the meat was freakin delicious and my other friends who had the brisket as well were similarly pleased . unfortunately , most of the sides we ordered were deemed inedible . my bacon walunt brownie was not melt in your mouth , rather it was chock full of thick-cut jerky-like chunks of bacon that got stuck in my teeth . the corn had a very strange greasy spiciness to it , and the potato salad left something to be desired and was uneaten at the end of the meal . the staff that came around to check in was super friendly and offered my friend a replacement for the corn , but she was stuffed full of brisket at that point . i was unsatisfied after the wine , though it was a tasty splash , so i ordered a half-pint of beer for N . N . maybe this place is better suited for those with more disposable income , but if i ' m going to pay that kind of money for a snack and a drink , i want to feel spoiled , not cheated . 
this is easily one of the most expensive restaurants in town , and the place that you send the fancy people you know when they visit and want dinner . i ate here once and tried caviar for the first time ( i didn ' t really like it , but i made a big show about how good i thought it was so i would fit in with all the fancy people ) . i had a lobster roll , and it was delicious , and some soup . . . and i think a salad . all of it was good . i never went back because my starving-college-student-wallet wouldn ' t support it , but someday when i ' m rich and famous i might return to burlington and go to leunig ' s for dinner . 
i brought my children here for lunch saturday afternoon . we got there early so we were seated right a way . all three of us ordered burgers and they were amazing ! ! both my kids finished there burgers . the reason for the four stars was the service i say my waitress N times , when she took our order when she delivered our order , i asked her for the bill and ten minutes later she brought it . the place was getting pretty pack so i would have thought they would have wanted us out of there . when i finally received my bill i had to wait another ten minutes before she came and picked it up , i actually asked the hostess if she could run it . i would recommend prime N and will probably go back again but just hope that i don ' t get the same waitress . . . . . 
a great find for breakfast in new haven . me and my girlfriend came here this morning and ordered , two eggs style which came with toast and creamy grits . i order a side of maple pork sausage and because we checked in we received a free order of french toast . the food was delicious and our waitress was great . i definitely recommend coming and we will be back soon . 
i was visiting stella rosa in downtown philadelphia . i was extremely disturbed and offended by the customer service i experienced . i entered and asked where i could find the prosecco tasting . the response was ' prosecco is a sparkling wine . ' i said i know what it is , i am interested in knowing where the tasting is . the reply was ' it ' s not free tasting . ' i replied that i didn ' t ask if it was free , that i simply wanted to know where it was . i speak with an accent and am i a woman of color . i feel that i was disrespected and assumptions were made about me because of my appearance accent . i was prepared to purchase items at your store , but did not because i was treated very poorly . 
great and unique sandwiches at this south philly eatery . . . 
over the last N years , my parents and i have wandered over here , chomping away at the cheap , but tasty eats that make this little hole in the wall great . when driving out of the city , my dad ' s been known to call ahead , order take out , and pick the food up on the way . it ' s very much classic , street-style hk food . inexpensive , tasty , fast , and no nonsense " service . " very southern chinese . ) i had N . N bowls of wonton noodles , my brother had a bowl of congee and fish , my mother and father shared beef-tendon noodles . . . while the chef came out wearing a " jesus is my boy " hat , tilted sideways , and sat around talking to the other waiters . it was classic . i ' ll be back , and i ' ll eat much , much more . . . for cheap . ) 
came in for happy hour on a friday . we were able to get a table in the bar area right away . staff was friendly but service was kind of confusing , one of the bartenders also served as a waiter . the crowd was mixed and very friendly . happy hour specials are good certain cocktails , wine , and beer all N or less . had a few glasses of delicious and strong sangria . happy hour also includes a number of N appetizers , we tried shrimp dumplings which were good but took a half hour to come out . decided to stay for dinner , my eggplant napoleon dish was served lukewarm and my friend ' s was very hot . after my food was warmed up it was good and the broccoli rabe was a nice alternative to spinach . my friend had butternut squash risotto which we both liked . overall i would come back , the staff was really friendly and the restaurant itself was relaxing . the free dessert ( eggnog cheese cake ) we were given might have also helped our night go better . 
it was good
so i was looking for biddy early ' s pub . i know i ' m late to the game , didn ' t realize it has been gone for a while . well this place had the same atmosphere and that was a good thing , for me at least . the staff was pleasant , the bartender was a really nice woman who gave me the specials . N burger and beer lunch sounds great . it was very good too . the menu seems to have been upgraded . like N different kinds of fries , more italian stuff , truffled this and that . i love that they have a N for N check in special too . nothing like helping out the little guy ! 
i can only speak about the pizza and it ' s quite good ! i love , love , love the eggplant pizza . one day i ' ll try all the other pasta dishes but with the pizza calling my name , it ' s hard to try anything else . 
we visited this excellent little restaurant N nights ago . we have lived in philadelphia almost N months now and this was by far the best meal we have had yet . my steak was cooked to perfection and my wife ' s burger was delicious . this is the first review i have ever written and was well worth signing up . . thank you so much and we will b back soon ! 
grand buffet is one of the best chinese restaurants in the area . i usually go there for lunch , they are always busy . i love the black pepper chicken and peanut butter chicken , they are my favorite ! i am suprised by how much seafood they provide on the buffet during lunch time . i tried their steamed white fish ( what the tag shows ) , pretty good , very fresh , they have shrimp on the hot buffet , also cold shrimp on the salad bar , and guess what i see crawfish ! love them ! for N . N all you can eat , don ' t think you will find a place with better deal with that much seafood . and i know they even have more seafood on the buffet during dinner time , but i never have time to try it . , they say they bring out crab legs , clams and stuff , and steak and frog legs on weekend menu , i ' ve got to try their dinner menu too ! their steam table is always hot , i like it that way . they have a hugh salad and desert bar , all the fresh fruits and can fruits , and all those cakes ! but i gotta say my favorite part is the softserve ice cream meachine , they have cones for you to take away ! un . . but they don ' t serve mix dirnks only beer and wine . but that won ' t stop me from going back , because guess what i did , i peek through their kitchen window , and their kitchen is very clean ! so is their bathroom ! that ' s all i care about , the cleaness ! and the food is good too , friendly waitress , i like it ! 
hot wok was just alright . can ' t say i enjoyed it as much as some other reviewers , but it was pretty not bad . the service was a little too attentive- like they watched our every move and came to refill waters as soon as a sip was taken . felt a bit awkward , to be honest . i guess it ' s better than a lack of attention though . veggie mu shu appetizer was decent , though the pancake was pretty dry . i had the twice- cooked pork from their specials menu ( though i doubt this menu rotates much ) as suggested by another yelper in a previous review . it was tasty and the spice wasn ' t overpowering . the side of brown rice was disappointing- way overcooked and dry . overall not bad , but not good enough to hurry back for either . 
people who eat here have reported having spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth , the true nature of the universe as well as deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can . this is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth . in addition , it is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual dimensions and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers , take your order , or just crack open the coldest budweiser this side of wyckoff . . i ' d take a star off because of some mega babe model waitress that refused to swaddle me into a papoose and have me sleep off the rest of my meal strapped to her back , but i also refuse to be defeated , and will be back . 
i loved this place . . . i would recommend this place to everybody . . . awesome experience . . 
verlaine was the first stop on my first night during my last trip to nyc . i liked the decor of this place and the setup , and they have a good menu of cocktails - your typical kind of asian infused cocktails . my cousin , a friend , and i got to verlaine after N , but the bartender was nice enough to give us our first round at happy hour prices . score ! while at verlaine , i had a lemongrass mule and hanoi martini . when i first got my lemongrass mule , the bartender asked me if i liked it just to make sure , since he said it ' s usually strong or too unique for people ' s tastes . i told him that i loved it , that i love lemongrass ( or any herb pepper infused drinks for that matter ) , and that i ' ve liked drinks with the term " mule " in it . the hanoi martini was also good - but nothing really different than a lychee martini at other similar bars . overall , good experience here - yummy drinks and very friendly service ! 
i live close by this restaurant and its one of the best indian restaurant for non vegetarians . the weekend buffets are tasty with a wide variety of items . the ambiance is great . i loved that spicy chicken N . i would love to back again with my family . 
-one of my favorite pizza shops in connecticut . friendly environment clean restaurant rest rooms . they got the best taste crust . the only thing is that little tv . all they watch is " news " . i don ' t know about you but when i ' m eating i like to be in peace . the last thing i want to here is negative news . -over all they got the best pizza . and i tried them all trust . youtube . com aristadoe
this place kept me from exploring other restaurants in the area for a good N months . 
there was a point in time ( several months ) where i would be running around the city trying to catch one of kimchi taco truck ' s free promotional giveaways . now that game of cat and mouse is officially over now that i can come to prospect heights and delve into a carton of these delicious korean bbq tacos any evening that i wish . if you are looking for an interesting spin on tacos than look no further . this is the kind of food that is habitforming . best fusion tacos that i have ever consumed . finally , now in its own quaint setting in brooklyn . if this is your first time at kimchi grill , try their N taco deal . N gets you N tacos of you choice either bbq beef short-ribs , spicy pork , fried chicken , or falafel . my personal favorite is the spicy pork , but they ' re all just stunningly excellent . some of the best korean bbq that i have ever had in my life . their menu includes burritos , bowls and more . . . mostly korean bbq fusion . cash only , the menu is very moderately priced , but is so very scrumptious . just bring at least N for the tab and tip if this is a solo trip , trust me you ' ll pat yourself on the back for your great decision-making skills . this will ( hopefully ) be the first of a few brick and mortar locations in nyc . if you are fortunate enough to live in up-and-coming prospect heights you really must give this a try . only open for dinner hours as these guys are taking it to the streets during the daily grind . 
loved their cheesecake , couldn ' t finish it all ! check out my visit at nycitymama . com
i think this place is so overrated . why do new yorkers like to jump on the food-band wagon so much without really considering the food ? i think the portions here are tiny and think it ' s a rip-off to have to order a separate serving of noodles " on the side " --something any diner with a normal appetite would do . don ' t get me wrong--the food is tasty and the ambiance interior is better than other noodle shops , but the food is simply not that good . their pork belly appetizer is very good though . 
for our anniversary we wanted to pick a nice restaurant for dinner . i wanted to make a reservation at babbo , but couldn ' t get one . so i figured i ' ll settle for lupa . . . only to realize that lupa is not a substitute , but a top-notch restaurant with excellent food and wine . in our opinion we had a better experience here than we had at babbo . first impression - we had a reservation at N Npm but we arrived at N Npm and the hostess was happy to seat us . . . no fuss , just pleasant . . . the ambience is nice and cosy . . usually the first time at any restuarant we like to order the tasting menu . . because we believe that the chef present their choice in the menu . . . so it has to be the best ) . . food wine - we picked the tasting menu with wine pairing . there is no formal menu with the listing the tasting menu course . . . but it is picked by the chef for that day and the sommelier selects the wine to complement the food . . . we don ' t eat red meat and they were happy to provide alternates . . . after a couple of tasty tidbits our appetizer arrived . . it was " verdure miste " a sampler of antipasti . . . every bite was delicious . . i am not a huge fan of cold appetizer . . . this certainly changed that . . . the other N courses were also very flavorful and delicious . . the best pastas we have every had . . . the final course was a selection of cheese . . they were so fresh that you could taste the freshness . . service - extremely good service , the waitress was very knowledgeable and polite . bottomline - surely a keeper . . would come back again . . . we have recommended this place to a lot of friends . . . 
great little place , from the hospitable waiters singing italian , family photos covering the walls to the excellent food . linguini with garlic and eggplant , prosciutto , i could go on and on . yummy ! 
beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! this place charges significantly higher prices for their menu items ( drinks and food ) than is actually printed on the menus ! ! ! ! the menu says N for a beer and they charge you N or more . . beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! beware ! ! ! ! this place is a scam . . . . don ' t believe what they say and don ' t believe the prices in their menus ! ! ! they have no shame ! ! ! this has been reported to the vermont liquor control board . . . their license is about to be revoked . . . . don ' t subsidize this place . . . . 
it is educational . if you enjoy cooking shows- specifically alton brown- this is a great tour for you . our guide was very knowledgeable about how all of the pizza places in the area make their dough , the sauce cheese they use , and their ovens , etc the pizza and the pizza makers . it is awesome to see the relationships scott is super nice and so enthusiastic about pizza . it was great to try different styles of pizza and learn about the history of pizza . i was highly recommended this place . 
went to g lee ' s last week and am already craving the ribs again . ! have been here before a while ago and was greeted by this beautiful young server , i believe her name was joy . she truly made my experience there wonderful . was kind of disappointed when i didn ' t see her . the bartender was amazing . very informative on the menu and knew what he was doing definitely . but the food ! ! ! ! i loved everything about it . only reason why i give it N stars is because my cajun corn and greens were a little cold . otherwise , great atmosphere , great decor and great service ! will definitely be back . hopefully the waitress is back also . - ) 
had a great dinner for yardley restaurant week - everything was delicious . the only downside was that none of the items on the restaurant week menu were on the regular menu . i guess we will have to go back to try their other items ! ) 
it was worth going from manhattan to astoria to enjoy exquisite italian cuisine on a lovely sunday afternoon . i was impressed with the attentiveness and truly polite and friendly demeanor of the wait staff . the food was really good ! my friend and i shared a pizza and a pasta dish . there were so many exciting selections on the menu and i already have an idea what i will order on my next visit . very easy to get there from manhattan . take the n train to ditmars ( last stop ) and walk to ditmars and Nth . . . you won ' t miss it . 
the pizza is good , but pasquale ' s only offers take-out . it ' s located in a seedy part of main street , so have them deliver . 
this is by far my favorite pizza spot in new york . the vibe is great -- good lighting , good crowd , and unique menu . the owner also makes visits to all the tables -- really nice guy . everyone says the cherry jones is the best - but i would say the pie with bacon marmalade is far better . the bacon marmalade is made locally , and with the caramelized onions it has just the right balance of flavor . although good , the cherry jones has just a few too many cherries which makes it too sweet , and with the gorgonzola it ' s just a little too intense . i would also suggest ordering ' the falconer , ' an off-menu pie my friend ' s boyfriend told me about , which has roasted eggplant . final note awesome bathrooms a detail that always gives a restaurant extra brownie points . 
this place was pretty packed at N pm on a tuesday night . i think the tables to sit at to eat were all full . i think this place is somewhat confusing . . . . no one had any idea where to pay . i went to the chocolate counter and bought a piece of each chocolate ( about N N pound for N ) . the lady helping me out was super nice but the one piece of dark chocolate i had , really was not that good . it was soooo sweet . everything is super pricey here , so i don ' t think i ' ll be returning to buy their stuff . maybe to try the food though . 
i would say it ' s pretty authentic ! i have coming to this place for almost N years ! i was put on to this restaurant from a malaysian family . i am a big fan of this restaurant . one of my favorites in little italy . 
i finally had a chance to sit down with friends and have a nice meal here . i ordered the seared sea scallops with a side of the " loaded mashed potatoes " , which are potatoes " loaded " with a variety of seasonings , spices and bacon bits . we ordered a salad appetizer enough for the table consisting of little " balls " of fresh , crispy lettuce , quartered , topped with bacon bits and a thousand island-style dressing . it was very yummy . the sea scallops were cooked to perfection , but just a tad bland . . . thankfully they did include a little sauce on the side that made them very enjoyable . the mashed potatos were quite tasty as well . they had a very soft bread that came with a very soft , creamy warm sweet butter spread that was quite good . my friends also ordered calamari , which i tried - it was very crispy and yummy . overall i will stick to my original N star rating . it was a bit toward the pricey side , but the food was very good ( but i wouldn ' t say amazingly good ) . the presentation was nice , and despite the restaurant being packed - it wasn ' t obnoxiously loud and all the other patrons made for a fun and enjoyable atmosphere . the decor and ambiance is quite nice . the staff in the place were all excellent , and we had a very good , professional and polite waiter who didn ' t intrude on our experience , but always made sure to bring the food out fast and top our water off - so i would say the service was fantastic . 
no were better to get a fantastic glass of wine with great company . . love this place
this is review N for lombardi ' s , so i really have no idea what it is that i can add to the collection ( not that it ' s going to stop me from at least writing something . ) no trip to new york city is complete for my wife and i without a visit to lombardi ' s . it ' s the first pizza here in the us , and by far the best . coal fired , tasty sauce , and best as the classic cheese with a little basil . just out of this world . after eating here i really can ' t do pizza for another couple months because everything else just pales in comparison . the salad is ok , but nothing worth making any note of , but of course salad isn ' t why you come here . 
while the pizza might be fine for a drunken adventure , the staff is terrible . the cashier has nothing more to bark than , " cash only " ( with no signs to support ) and the bouncer ( that ' s right a pizza place bouncer ) randomly decides when it is and is not appropriate for people to eat pizza inside the establishment . if this pizza was mind blowingly amazing i wouldn ' t have posted this scathing review , but with mediocre pizza a nice staff is all they should aspire to . since they don ' t even have that . . . 
i got the california dreaming hotdog- avocado lemon tomato dressing . it was N bucks plus tax . the hotdog was ok but with the topping it was different . i ' m not sure if it ' s worth N bucks . . prob not . . . . but i would try it here once . i might come back and try the other kinds of hot dogs next time . it ' s open late . . . i could see this being a good drunk spot for a late night snack . i saw a debit pin thing so i assume they take card but i brought cash ( in case ) ! 
if you have a friend who wants fish but you want pasta , just know you won ' t be sitting them . the various stations and seats are all separated . really tasty dishes and cool concept but logistically , no . 
the last time i was there , i was with the husband ' s family . it ' s always beneficial to go with a large party , because then you can order more dishes and share them all . we definitely took advantage of this , and perhaps went a little overboard . 
beautiful and cosy atmosphere . secret spot . nice staff and big tasty portions . will definitely get back there ! 
another fun irish pub where the music comes to you " live and direct " on tuesday nights . grab a bench , grab a booth and grab some eats--it makes for a lovely evening . their salads are pretty good and my friends also love their sliders ! my favorite part however is their . . . dum dum dum beer selection ! woohoo ! 
hands down , the best place for burgers in fishtown and probably the whole philly area . 
i found it one of the best indian fast food restaurant in the town . food was prepared nicely with less oil . service was also customer friendly . specially i like paneer patty . over all great experience . restaurant and rest room were very clean and well maintained . 
my favorite cheap delivery place ! ! ! they have the best old bay cheese fries . . . i add mozz and cheese wiz to them but they are awesome ! the delivery people usually get lost but they call and are always really sweet . now their are for sure better places out their , but for the price . . . this place is top in it ' s category . i ' ll update when i ' ve eaten more food types but so far everything has been good ) 
if you like rules , this is the place for you . i went to this restaurant this past friday evening , feb . N , N . there is the rule that everyone must be present in the party to be seated . it did not matter that there was room in the restaurant but very little in the bar where we were standing or that the majority of our party was there , or that we said we would be ordering food while we waited to pay for our table . then there is the rule , as the hostess gleefully and triumphantly informed us , that all the tapas must be decided on and ordered at once . the tapas we received were good but small and we did want to order more but were afraid to because of the no order again rule dictated by the hostess . overall , the food was good , but small and pricey . the hostess would have created a lot of good will , if she had told us under crowded conditions these were the rules but under the circumstances she could bend them . i would not eat here again because when i eat out i like to enjoy myself and not be hassled . 
i love thai food . i love the heat , the curry , the veggie to meat ratio and it reminds me of chinese food with french influences . i went to erawan for a early dinner and i pretty much had the spot to myself . my server , a pretty asian lady , seated me and gave me a menu . the menu was expansive and i wanted to try everything . first i chose a bowl of tom yum soup with chicken and i ordered it thai spicy , not american spicy and you know what that meant ! tom yum soup is my cure all chicken soup . i used to work across the street from a thai restaurant and whenever i felt the inkling of any illness , i would order up a bowl of it with extra garlic and super spicy and it chased away any germ , bacteria , illness or depression trying invade my body and here it was . they were willing to prepare it as i asked . the soup was superb , crammed with chunks of chicken , tomatoes , mushrooms and lemongrass . when i ordered my entr e , i tried to throw them a curve and asked for something not on the menu . i ordered a dish called " evil jungle prince " , but the chef never heard of it which is sad because if you ever tried it , you will never forget it ! i instead ordered the chu chee curry with duck . it was delicious with the crisp spices and coconut milk and veggies and tender duck meat . before erawan was here it was another thai restaurant and they had a delicious thai herbal cake that was scrumptious , when i asked her about it she was genuinely interested about the cake . all in all i had a great dinner and i appreciated how the staff at erawan made me feel at home . 
for all of us N-somethings figuring out how to make our way in this cruel world , tom ' s is a lifesaver . we go every saturday morning to drink coffee and eat cookies while waiting in line , to open the door and see the plastic flowers and carefully hung christmas lights , to be greeted with a kiss and a handshake by gus , the owner , to eat the kind of diner food that sticks with you all day , and to leave feeling a little less alone in the world . i also appreciate that while my table may be full of hipsters , the restaurant attracts people from all walks of life who call prospect heights home , from police officers to retirees . as we tell someone new every week as they look forlornly at the line out the door , " it ' s worth the wait ! " 
terrible experience
bubby ' s sucks ! we got there at N a . m . on a sunday . the wait was N minutes , which is to be expected at a place where all the hot spotters go . no biggie . but once we were seated and ordered it took another N minutes for the food to come out . during this N minutes the waitress did not come to our table once . no " the food will be out shortly " or " do you need anything ? " nothing . we finished our meal , which was okay but nothing special , without sight of the waitress . the staff here is horrible . the food is blah and overpriced . and they try to kill you on the drinks . N for a draft beer ? give a break . of course , once we finally were able to track the waitress down to get the bill she was quick and tried to turn into the sweetest thing in pursuit of her tip . fail . N tip . terrible service . mediocre food . ridiculously overpriced . won ' t be back . 
food was great , cheap and lots of it ! ! nice decor . N minute walk over the bridge to red bull arena . serve a huge salad , plate of olives , N different breads , homemade thick potato chips , big plate of assorted veggies , big plate of yellow rice with your meal . you ' ll need to skip lunch before coming here because they serve alot of food , we only ordered main courses ( great seafood ) and we couldn ' t walk out of the place ! ! meals like this , they ' ll charge you up to Nx as much in manhattan and the food is not as good . 
el rey is a small modern mex restaurant on chestnut street . the happy hour specials are great with dollar tacos . certain things on the menu can be overly greasy . tables can be hard to get at times . i find this place has too much inconsistency sometimes things are great and then other times not so much . its a fun place to go with friends but mostly because of the yummy drinks finger food . 
i like how brooklyn are getting clean up . original brooklyn into manhattan style . that ' s not cool i like the brooklyn style food , which they should not take that away as well . what a shame food look great , but like another happy value kid ' s meal lunch . 
this place is good if your looking for some crack any time of the day . loaded with hoods and young thugs , rats , roaches , and paraded by all types of kids from N N-N N when the city decides to let the entire school district out at the same time ! and also watched N N by police . great place to bring the kids , like i said , if they ' re crack babies . 
i was looking through yelp ' s sushi listings for possible dinner options for myself , and was surprised to find kidari sushi suddenly appear in my neighborhood ! the location has been several different businesses lately , so hopefully this one will stick . i placed an order for pick up to bring to my late night shift at work , and got a look at the interior , which is fairly typical for your local sushi bar , dark dark dark , long sushi bar in back , and a fair amount of seating . the hostess was very nice and had my order ready and waiting one spicy scallop roll and their half maki combo appetizer . the scallop roll was not very spicy , and had a bit too much rice for my tastes , but it had whole pieces of scallop ! usually sushi places chop the fish into tiny bits for spicy rolls , but not here and the scallop was very fresh , plus i liked the sesame seeds they rolled onto rice . i love the concept of the half maki combo appetizer , which includes N pieces of salmon , tuna , eel , and kanpyo , and they were all delish and its a fun option if you don ' t want a lot of one type of maki ( or like having a bunch of options , like me ) . the rolls are good and fresh , but i wish the prices were better . other area sushi options have cheaper maki prices and i ' d rather walk a little further and pay less for similar quality sushi . but i ' m glad that they ' ve opened in this area ! 
my girlfriend and i live around the corner , and we ' ve been pretty excited about the opening of this restaurant . we both like mexican food , and it ' s a bit difficult to find in this polish neighborhood . so when we came to this place , we were mostly happy to have the option of a mexican meal and looking forward to the outdoor space in the spring . unfortunately , the outdoor seating wasn ' t available yet , but the food and the hospitality blew us away . we ordered a veggie burrito , a veggie- and a fish- taco , and some hand-cut fries ( with chipotle mayo on the side ) . the service was super friendly and the owner chef made the simple food we ordered look and taste as if it were served in a fancy restaurant . we definitely look forward to becoming regulars at taqueria kermes . 
we had a great experience at this restaurant . we were a party of three and we shared a selection of appetizers ( crostini and meatballs ) and pastas and then had the bronzini and rib eye ( tasty and tender ) . what a treat . we loved it ! the food was plentiful and we took home a lot of leftovers . we also had a selection of deserts . the corn gelato sounded weird but we decided to try it and we loved it . the staff was really great . even though every table was full they did not make us feel we had to hurry . i can ' t wait to go back ! 
churrasco steak - N stars , very tender with nice mashed potato , must have red sangria - N stars octopus salad - N stars key lime leches cake - N stars cafe con leches - N stars service - N stars clean bathroom asked for the room in the back as the music in the front was too loud . 
food is good and healthy , service is great , and you can byob
came here with a friend and we both found the food underwhelming . our lobster mac and cheese arrived without the main advertised ingredient lobster . when we informed our waiter all he had to say was " funny " . no , actually N for a lobster mac and cheese without lobster isn ' t all that amusing . after the dish returned with some lobster mixed in we dug in only to find it really bland . we ended up seasoning it with some old bay seasoning to make it more flavorful . . . not what i was expecting . the lobster roll was just not my type . i happen to like my lobster roll with a good amount of mayo . this was lightly seasoned with a bunch of celery . those who don ' t like mayo might be pleased with the lobster roll here . the crab cake appetizer was the best item of the night . 
warning i ate here on july july N , N and i ordered the whole lobster for N . when it arrived i noticed immediately that they had removed the lobster tail - which is where most of the lobster meat is ! ! ! ! the waiter tried to convince me that it was in fact a whole lobster - but i have been eating whole lobster my whole life and it ' s pretty obvious when the entire tail is missing ! be careful when you order food here ! i left hungry and upset . 
delicious food , great service . salted caramel bundino is amazing
i strolled in , noticing the happy hour sign . the first thing i noticed was i was the only one inside . secondly , whoever was behind the bar smelled like alcohol . and , this dude was also slurring as he spoke . when i tried to order a drink , he walked out the door , and didn ' t return for about N minutes . some lady came out and listened as i questioned this strange encounter , to which she just smiled at me . i don ' t know who she was , be she looked like she was cooking . i decided to leave and never come back . 
when friends visit from out of town , i gravitate here with them . food is one reason . but more importunely , when i want dinner with friends who i have not seen in many years , i don ' t want a dark and noisy or rushed experience . jewel of india is well lit and not pretentious . it ' s not so acoustically echoey that you can ' t have serious conversations , or have to hear all the details of conversation from the other table . if you want to linger over dinner , you ' re not rushed out . but it ' s still a lively place , with a good mix of dinners . the breads are terrific , loved the coconut naan they had as a special . the rice and mint chutney are consistently good . the meat dishes are very well made . i would not call it a gourmet restaurant . but since hanover doesn ' t have any dinner restaurant where i can take my friends to eat the traditional food of my own rural new england culture , i will keep going to the jewel of india . 
was very surprised to see prime N in orange yelp rating at three stars . i ' ve been to prime N in new haven many times and it ' s easily a five star burger joint just made my first trip to the prime N and orange and was equally impressed as i was in new haven . it ' s a much bigger space so you don ' t get that intimate feeling of the new haven style pub . . . but the food was terrific . my wife the patty melt on multigrain bread with a side salad and she was in heaven . i have the latino burger that was quick to perfection . i highly recommend
this is the worst portuguese restaurant . quantity over quality is what it is . the food does not taste fresh . they give you the worse cuts of meat , the fish was bad , the pork was rotting . my kids had chicken cutlets and they tasted old . worst . save your money and eat quality . 
people only say good things about this place out of loyalty for bill woods . other than that it ' s the worst place in the gayborhood to eat . i ' ve tried time and time again to swallow my proclivities and i ' m dissapointed every time . one of the worst meals i ' ve ever had and the service followed . stay away . 
so happy to have a groovy cafe close to home . great atmosphere and very friendly staff . yummy food and wifi too ! my neighborhood just got that much tastier ! 
here ' s why i gave it a five star rating . first , the people who work here are very friendly , accommodating , and honest . second , the seat we had was outside on the sidewalk on a beautiful early summer day , and it couldn ' t have been more pleasant . third , the food was delicious at that price , which was extremely reasonable . fourth , we had tickets and had to get in and out in a certain amount of time , and our waitress kept us stricly on schedule without appearing pushy or intrusive . she simply did her job on time and as appropriate . finally , the other patrons were as happy with their meal and experience as we were . so even though this isn ' t le cirque , it ' s certainly got a much better tasting food for your dollar , and couldn ' t be a more pleasant experience . 
nook is a tiny place . yes , there is a solitary man taking care of all customers . but the food was beyond good . i loved the baguette with cheese and jam appetizer it sounded like a curious combination but it arrived beautifully plated and was easily devoured by all . my scramble was great , the potato pancakes on par , and the benedict good . 
errrrrrr . ickkkkk . creepy insides . filthy outside . wwtm ? tried several dishes . all yuck . love leaving , won ' t be back . all no one ' s ! ! ! db ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
maybe more like a N . N . stopped in for brunch and first impression was good--the dining room was nicely decorated and spacious , plus the hostess was very nice . however , service quickly became confusing as we didn ' t have a set waiter waitress and it took a long time to both put our order in and also get the check when we were done with our meal . as for the food , i got the vegetable frittata which was seasoned well , but was served room temperature . it was also pretty small and left me hungry to the point where my husband and i picked up some food somewhere else afterwards . actually , everything seemed to be pretty small , even the brunch punch and my orange juice which i finished in two sips . just not sure the food is worth the price . 
i work close by so this is the go to spot for group lunches . the entree ' s are always great ! the service has been good every time and there is typically no wait to be seated . some of the hits mac cheese , swordfish , roasted chicken ( amazing ! ! ! ) , green beans , roasted butternut squash soup , most of the cocktails some of the misses wine list ( served warm too ) the decor is very nice in my opinion . . . kinda rustic and log cabin like . in the back there is a room lit with red lights two couches , a chair or two and a pool table . seems like a great place to go for dinner with a group of friends and have a little fun without being at a bar . i ' ll definitely be going back . 
a little taste of provence . fresh ingredients , original assortments on salads and tartines . a new favorite place for a quick refreshing lunch ! 
cute little place . good food . service a little slow but that ' s because it was pretty packed . will visit again . 
another garces restaurant that is on point . an amazing whiskey selection , that , when paired with the village whiskey burger and duck fat french fries , leaves the customer with quite the incredible dining experience . great staff too , very knowledgable about the world of whiskey and quite friendly . only caveat is that they do not take reservations , so if you aim to go on anytime thursday-saturday , come about an hour before you think you will be hungry and put your name in . wait times can be absurd . but besides that , delicious , fun , friendly . another win for garces group . 
this is the official dinner of any red carpet screening at the ziegfeld . the wait is long , but that ' s part of the experience . people drive here from all over the city to get great food to soak up the booze from the night . the cart starts at N Np - N Na , any other time it ' s another company . expect a wait of about N minutes average . sometimes it can be Nm if you ' re lucky or up to an hour if you ' re not . there is a way to bypass this line , as this is new york and money talks . the food is amazing and many many times i wish i had a bigger stomach . this is indeed my last mean on earth . sometimes i would crave this on monday and would not stop until i get it later in the week . they ' ve now changed it to add your own sauce . you can drown your combo rice in white sauce all you want , but definitely go easy on the spicy hot sauce ! 
pretty good food at very , very reasonable prices . i ' ve been there a few times now and it ' s worth the slightly longer walk from work to grab lunch or a snack here . my favorite thing right now is probably their curry fried chicken cutlet over rice--unlike a lot of places in the area the chicken actually has some meat to it and isn ' t paper thin . and the curry ? --well , nothing special , it ' s your typical mild korean curry , but we are talking about a place that ' s a " taste of home , " so no complaints here . their kimbop is alright , one of ( if not the ) cheapest places to get kimbop around here , though i ' ve had better quality wise . try not to get kimbop too far outside of the lunch and dinner rush times as it can get dry from sitting in that cold case . my absolute staple favorite here ? their N ( or included with their lunch box sets ) simple green salad . they have this super garlicy sweet vinegar ( ? correct me if i ' m wrong on the vinegar ) dressing that i absolutely looooove , though i will say i keep a roll of mints on hand for after that snack d . so in summary-- good food that i would make at home , though coming during rush hours is best for food quality and freshness . 
ordered from fire pit bbq for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised , as almost all of the other businesses that opened in their current location didn ' t make the best food , and ultimately all went out of business . we ordered a large serving of the chicken cutlets in garlic sauce , which was served with rice and french fries . the meal was delicious . my family tends to order from pic nic in east newark , but they don ' t deliver and have been getting more expensive with a decline in the food quality . i found that fire pit came through not only with a great price for the portion size , but the delivery was free and the food was very delicious . it tastes like authentic portuguese cuisine , and i really couldn ' t have had a better first impression . looking forward to trying some of their other dishes . will post another review if anything changes , but let ' s hope not ! 
went here for brunch today was very very happy . the veggie gorditas were delish my hard-to-please dining companion exclaimed " these are the best veggie tacos i ' ve ever had " about his dish . if you are in a hurry , don ' t eat here . go when you have time to relax enjoy the care put into a proper home-cooked meal . nice array of mexican wines fresh juices but really looking forward to them getting a liquor license ! will go again , N . 
meh . the service was not good , the food was slow and mediocre . i was in a table of two and felt like we were our waiter ' s afterthought , maybe larger tables get better service . i had the pulled pork entree , which wasn ' t anything special and it arrived rather cold and was served on a bed of mashed potatoes that tasted pretty insipid , think high school cafeteria potatoes . . . . the didn ' t add up either , aside from the nice N bottle wine list , i think this restaurant deserves another to its price range . i think it ' s definitely pricier than the description . . . the ambience was pretty lovely however . . . overall , i was disappointed and would not return . i don ' t relate to the stellar reviews here at all . 
the N yr . old " when i walked into jimmy ' s diner i thought that this was the best diner in the whole neighborhood but after i got my food i realized , it was the best diner in the world ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " the N yr . old " the food was delicious . " the aunt i have the joy of growing my nieces love of fine diner dining ) . we love jimmy ' s diner and the host was the best ! ! ! ! ! thank you for making the walk in the snow and the twenty minute wait worth it . 
food is delicious , atmosphere wonderful , and wait staff professional . we come here between N and N times per week . we love it ! ! 
amazing service . creative presentation . some of the best food in philly ! totally worth checking out . 
what can i say about this place ? harold dieterle won top chef for a reason and this restaurant is evidence that he earned it . the duck fat popcorn was a great way appetizer to get things going . i came here for restaurant week with my girlfriend and we got to try the mussels , gumbo , chicken , short rib , streusel financier and the chocolate souffle . the chicken dish was by far the best thing i have eaten in a long time . i was shocked since chicken usually isn ' t anything special , but perilla blew my mind . in terms of top chef restaurants in nyc , this was definitely better than talde . based on perilla , marrow is definitely on my list of places to go . 
forget geno ' s and pat ' s . this place is amazeballs . . . . plus , it ' s not filled with all the tourists who are having their first cheesesteak and taking photos and getting yelled at by the staff . this place is filled with people who have been coming for decades , friendly staff , yummers steaks and beer . any way you order your steak , it ' s good to go and fast . grab a tee shirt and represent . jimmy fallon did . 
since i live in the neighborhood i decided to give this restaurant a try with my friend . we arrived at Npm on a thursday , and while we expected to wait a bit for a table we didn ' t expect to stand at the door for over N minutes completely ignored . the dining room was full , but it ' s only about N tables , so not sure what that was all about . we finally sat down with menus and waited another N minutes before we were greeted by a server . i had to ask one of the servers passing by for service . not a good sign . it also wasn ' t a good sign that other patrons were anxiously looking around for their server to come to their tables . so we ordered the pad thai w chicken and a shrimp and bamboo stir fry . we specified spicy , and we received the opposite . the food was generally bland . the chicken was obviously overcooked ( tough and rubbery ) . we received a side order of rice , which seemed like it was previously cooked and then reheated . it was a bit hardened . this is a byob , but their non-alcoholic drink choices are minimal , so bring something - anything to drink with you . i am a huge fan of thai cuisine . maybe i am spoiled since i ' ve had the pleasure of experiencing the real thing in thailand . . . but this was absolutely sub-par . i ' m really disappointed and wish that it was better . i will not be going back . 
we started our day in soho with this great restaurant . extremely popular and very busy . were extremely lucky to get our table within N minutes . everything we ordered was made to perfection ! great place for brunch and then start your walk through soho . very reasonable pricing for quality of food and service . 
we were initially attracted to this place because of the open layout and extensive beer selection . however , like an std carrying dime piece hooker , looks can be deceiving . ten minutes after being seated we still were not approached by a server , only given water by the hostess ( and the joint was not crowded . ) we finally had to prompt the hostess to send a server over to take our beer and food orders . with all of the beers on tap , the one my hot date ordered was not available - of course . first round o ' beers was enjoyable . food came out looking tasty . my burger , despite ordering it without cheese , came with cheese , along with that doggone duo of lettuce and mayo - not mentioned on the menu . overfall , food was good , but made my hot date vomit - seriously - as a result of how fried and greasy the chicken was . after leaving the table again to fetch a beer menu , neglected again by the service , the second round of beers arrived after our glasses sat on the table empty for another ten minutes . my N beer tasted like soy sauce . no joke . had to choke it down in order to justify the price - no way was i going to leave a wounded N soldier . cliff notes - service was terribly neglectful and unknowledgable despite the amount of servers on staff and slow nature of the night - don ' t get the N soy sauce beer - or the chicken snitzel because you may have an up chuck reflex - setting was cool ( pillows were available to nap on ) - large beer list to choose from ( beware , your first choice may not be available ! ) - service sucked hope this helps ! 
best or only brick oven pizza in the neighborhood . their different style pizzas are delicious and make it hard to choose from . they deliver , very convenient . 
my girlfriend and i recently went to balthazar for dinner . we both felt that the ambiance is excellent and the mix of casual and business crowd fits right in with the entire experience . the food was outstanding and affordable ( at least for new york ) , considering what we ordered we started with the balthazar salad , which is an outstanding salad and we highly recommend . for main entrees , we had the joues de boeuf - the tenderness of the beef is perfect . the duck confit is also outstanding and for dessert we shared the warm chocolate cake , which is good , though not superb . i highly recommend this restaurant as our entire bill one appetizer , two main dishes , desert , two herbal teas , and two glasses of red wine came and tip was quite reasonable . of course , the food is the best part . 
i have only good things to say about my experience here . five plus stars . welcoming friendly service , perfect mixology , delicious and creative food . 
really good spot . fun decor . good fresh flavors and friendly flavor . ate there last night and had delivery tonight . both great . 
- exceptional vegetarian food - very fresh ingredients - variety of menu that ' s not overwhelming - large beverage selection - friendly staff but they seem to take about half the year off . reminds me of julius gold in good at gold . so , if they ' ve open they ' re closed saturdays . . . ) do it ! you will feel good after . i always get the large falafel sandwich , it fills me up . 
i have been coming here for several years now and i consider alta one of my top N favorites in manhattan ! truly tasty food , helpful and friendly staff and the decor makes you feel warm and cozy . try their brussel sprouts , spaghetti ( it is not your typical ! ) even their blt is not your average . everything is delicious ! ! 
very nice ambiance and pleasant staff , but the food was below average . i couldnt agree more with other reviews about it being disproportionately priced for the quality and taste . i ordered a fennel and arugula salad and swordfish entree . the salad was loaded with vinegar so i couldn ' t taste the fennel or arugula . the swordfish had very little taste at all to the point that i know i was eating fish only because of the consistency . even the polenta lacked flavor . friendly staff and ambiance can only take a restaurant so far but for these prices , hearth should have one of nyc ' s top chef ' s , which they clearly don ' t ! ! 
i came here for dinner with a friend . i say the food is a maybe and the drink was a definitely no go ! i feel like this isn ' t authentic by any means . i was confused if it was spanish tapas or peruvian food . . . . but since they label their place as latin american cuisine , i ' ll just nod and say okay . their menu isn ' t focused it ' s kind of like all different " latin american " cuisines thrown on together . we started off with the tuna tiradito ceviche . no where on the menu it described it to have N different kinds of tuna ceviches . i guess it was nice to give N a taste , for me it was less of a ceviche but fusioned sashimi . one of the N concoction was sliced tuna sashimi with lime mojito drizzled on top . like what the top chef judges say , instead of making three mediocre things make one good one . i would send that advice to the chef for the tuna ceviche . we also got the tamal which wasn ' t too memorable . we had the lechon the pork shank to share . the dish was very big . the pork shank was cooked well and the sauce was very good a bit on the salty side . they gave of " tamal " which tasted like grits and when it dried up it had a jello consistency . it didn ' t look appealing nor did it taste so good . the jug of sangria that we ordered didn ' t come until our main course . it was the worst sangria i ' ve ever tasted . do not do the sangria ! ! ! ! i feel like all the dishes were trying to be upscale with the plate food decor . even if the plates looked pretty the food didn ' t taste good . the ambiance is okay , very commercial and a bit cliche . it ' s a modern latin feel ? ! didn ' t really feel it . one plus is that the restaurant is really big . i didn ' t feel like i was suffocating my all means ( hard to find in ny ) . mediocre service and food , terrible drinks is a formula for not comin back . . . . 
i would definitely recommend this restaurant . my husband and i are both very picky when it comes to restaurants-especially greek restaurants and i ' m very happy that we found this place and i look forward to going there for dinner . we went on a sunday afternoon so we ordered off of the brunch menu . when going here you can totally walk by and miss it , it ' s not very big . however , upon entering the ambiance that the owners have created is very warm and inviting . from the decorations , lighting , soothing music and comfy seating one could sit for hours and enjoy a lovely meal . we began our meal with the horatiki salad , which is basically cucumber , tomatoes , feta , onions , capers and black olives . it was very good with the right amount of seasoning and the veggies were very fresh . i then had the moussaka which was garnished with a small roasted tomato and a sprig of rosemary . the layers of eggplant , zucchini , meat sauce and bechamel were rich , succulent and hearty , just the way moussaka should taste . our waitress was very attentive and overall the store seamed spotless , it is very well taken care of and clean . i truly enjoyed my first great tasting greek meal in nyc and can ' t wait to go back- so i can order dessert ! 
this is as good as some of the yakitori places you can find on st marks . price is reasonable and service was great . cow tongue was interesting and gizzard was really interesting . prawn was delicious as ever and most of all , people i was having dinner with were fun to talk to . if you are ever in the theater district and want some good japanese food , give this place a try . don ' t order udon though . 
one of the best small indie venues i ' ve been to . minus a star for the sketchy neighborhood . 
very good fresh homemade crepes and the icecream is very good ! the wait time for desserts is a little bit long but def worth it for the fresh quality
ahhhh . i had to breath before writing this review . . . . . my wife and i went against our better judgment and instead of ordering from the linden house like we do every saturday night . we ordered from the galaxy . we ordered the appetizer sampler and a napoleon panini to split . . . . . . . i waked in and was given an attitude from the guy at the counter who was playing with his phone . he looked like the manager . . . . i get home , the soup was ice cold , the chicken fingers and chicken wngs were so greasy that they look like the ones you would get fron one of those fride chicken spots in down linden , and the chicken quality waa horrible . . . with the sandwich we got woffle fries with brown gravy and mozzarella . . . the fries were so freezer burned it was unreal . . . . . now to the sandwich , which is the only edible thing that we would eat at this point . . . . after eating about half of the first half , my wife finds two hairs on the sandwich . . . . i could not believe that i just threw N in the trash . . . the food was so poor that i wouldnt feex it to my dog . . . my wife said lets call them and i said why ? i dont want them to replace the food or my money back . take it as a N learning experience . . . even if we did call , that jerk manager wouldnt have cared at all . he would have probaly hung up on me because so maney people call and complain im sure , they deffinently wouldnt give us the miney back and if we did get the food replaced . . . there is no doubt in my mind they would spit in it at the minimum . . . . if i could had given them negitave stars i would have . avoid this place . seriously , its a complete waste of money . and they dont even give a crap on how bad it is . please take my advice . . . 
the best we ' ve had in a long time
best sushi in the hartford area . the fact that it ' s a byob sushi restaurant , makes it even better . the ny rolls and the crazy rolls are to die for ! ! the service is excellent ! the blonde waitress is as sweet as can be and really knows the menu . 
one of the few places that i make it a point to go to whenever i ' m in ct is the russell . i only get to go there about N or N times a year and i have always had a pleasant experience . my server for the night was an extremely professional and knowledgeable individual by the name of gianna . she directed us to a comfortable place upstairs and went out of her way to make it even more comfortable by placing two tables together so that we could sit next to each other . her advice on appetizers ( and the best beer to go with them ! ! ! ) were accurate and added to the dining experience . if i didn ' t know better i would swear that she diverted other customers away so that i could have a quite romantic evening ( as much of our time we were alone upstairs . ) . the music was perfect . it was easy to hold a conversation in a normal tone of voice . the selections that were played only added to the moment . and when the candles were lit , it made me feel very special . gianna also provided valuable information about upcoming events as well as some of the past history of the russell . we did get to meet the owner ( hugh ) and he made us feel welcomed as one welcomes an old friend to your home who you haven ' t seen in a long time and who has stopped in for a nice chat . this is one of the few places that i will always return to and i strongly reccommend that anyone who wants a romantic evenining or just a friendly watering hole to stop in , the russell is the place to go . thankyou gianna for the great service . thankyou hugh for opening up such a wonderful establishment . 
love , love , love mundo vegan and so thrilled to have such an amazing vegan option in montclair ! N . the space . . . located on the ever-trendy church street ( street or garage parking ) . it ' s exceptionally clean inside , not to mention cozy and definitely has a zen-factor about it ! i really like that the kitchen happenings are visible from the dining area--it ' s nice to know how and with what your food is being prepared , particularly if you are vegan and or health conscious like i am ! N . the staff . . . the staff ( from waitstaff to cooks to owners ) is exceptional . they are friendly ( call me by my name and remember my favorite dishes that i typically order ! ) , knowledgable , and great at what they do . they also do a great job of keeping up with social media , and any time i ' ve reached out through facebook , have answered my questions almost immediately . N . most importantly , the food . . . i ' ve been vegan gluten-free for nearly N years now and have been to almost every vegan restaurant in the nyc metropolitan area . that said , the food here is great-tasting , mostly organic , and completely plant-based , with many gluten-free , nut-free , and or soy-free options . their menu changes a bit daily , but rest assured , you ' ll find something delicious ! my favorite dishes are the empanadas , mac and cheese , and amazing dessert pies ! i ' m excited to watch as they grow with time and at the prospect of what will hopefully be an expanding menu of delicious vegan eats ! 
amazing food , not well known , expect to wait a while even late at night . seems like people who know japanese food go there . 
taco trucks everywhere beware because this is the best . i just can ' t get enough ! there aren ' t many options , but they make due with what they have . how could there be many options in a small cart ? i always get the marinated pork and that really hits the spot every time i make a stop here . 
i am by no means a vegetarian . . but i could be if i could eat here all the time ! i love this place ! the scallion pancakes , sesame tofu ! ! yummmmmy ! you have to check it out , vegetarian or not . the food is amazing ! 
great ambiance , and good service . delicious appetizers , but a really weak main course . . . we had the traditional guacamole which was really delicious , then we tried the sopa de tortilla which was also really yummy . both the quesadilla de huitlacoche trufas and the costilla tuetano were amazing . . . this is where we should have stopped . . . we then ordered pollo toloache and the avocado fries . . . both not very good . 
seems to be a popular place . food quality was good and the selection reasonable . service was about as unfriendly as one can tolerate . seemed like customers were a bother . nov N N okay , i went again , this time for lunch . food was still good , tasty and not greasy . service was better . maybe it ' s me . . . so i increased my rating from N stars to N . 
tried this place before a show at the trocadero . i had general tso chicken and my friend had eggplant with garlic sauce . both were really fresh and tasty . huge portions and cheap tsing tao beer . glad we went . 
for the price this place is solid . cart food out of a restaurant . cash only . 
this place is amazing ! the happy hour lasts until N everyday and includes the lychee martini . . . . yum ! the food is delicious . . . sticky coconut rice , veggie pancakes . everyone talks about the lychee martini but there are other great drinks available for happy hour . i really like their sangria . it has a cool atmosphere due to great music , artwork on the walls and a pretty diverse and young crowd . the music is too loud ! you will have to yell to have a conversation . another slightly annoying aspect is that the placed gets over crowded . but for a N lychee martinis . . . it ' s worth it ! definitely a good after work place for friends to share tapas and get drunk cheaply ) 
pho ha makes pho well , makes pho fast , and makes pho cheap . in the past decade , i ' ve lunched here so many times that the servers recognize me . regardless of whether they actually do or not , service is always wicked fast they take our orders , fling them ( figuratively ) to the kitchen , and get our bowls of hearty deliciousness to us pronto . of the different vietnamese noodle soup types available , i go for a large bowl ( N ) with the works - bring on the fatty flank , tendons , tripe , and meatballs ! pho ha is a madhouse during weekend lunch hours when i usually go , so depending on your group ' s size , you may have to wait . but wait you will , once you smell their pho broth , beckoning . 
my husband and i are in burlington for the weekend and decided to give this place a try . i have crazy-severe allergies , so i can ' t eat just anywhere . the staff at boloco were awesome about making sure my food was not accidentally cross-contaminated . they took my allergies seriously ( unlike some other restaurants in the area ) . the food is really good . i can ' t remember the name of the salad i had , but it contained quinoa , arugala , beets , squash , and goat cheese . the flavor combination was to die for . my husband had a mexican bowl with pork . his was also delicious . bonus they serve beer ! my husband and i were both quite happy with the food , service , and the price . we will definitely stop by in the next time we are in town . 
overpricy . i order pollo a la brasa , it was dry . jalea especial , it had nothing special , just salty and the fish was spoiled . anticucho , it was raw , and not enough aji panca . ceviche , the amount of food wasnt even enough for a baby . but i admit it was the only dish that in taste was ok . the owner went to the table and wanted to describe the flavor of spoiled . the place look nice , but music too loud you cant even talk , and service very empiric , they try so hard to be fine dinning , without even knowing what that is that they forget how to cook peruvian . total ripoff
i love this place ! the food was totally delicious -- and the point is that it is healthy and full of rich flavors , so not every dish is going to please everyone . the lunch portions were generous and the staff was super-friendly . i thought the design was gorgeous -- clean and sleek , yet very warm and welcoming -- and it felt like a place where you could easily hang out . it was immaculately clean -- i noticed the a health code rating in the window , which they were quite proud of since i learned they had just gotten that on their first try ( which is apparently quite rare in the restaurant world ) . the staff was super-friendly and yet relaxed . in fact the vibe was so nice that my quite drop-in grab something moment shifted when i realized i could go upstairs and do a little business and stay for long . an excellent new place -- and even if there are some early kinks i didn ' t experience -- right out of the gate , they are terrific ! 
one of the many reasons why you should venture off to old city would be establishments like this . the entrance alone makes you feel like you have entered into a whole different state of mind . a relaxed state , a comfort state escaping the ongoing walking traffic outside , or the hustle of the cars trying to maneuver there way to that green light . i think it could also be that the feel of walking through the curtains sets the mood for some delightful cocktails , with a kick to it . a toast to the libation gods with a mouthwatering menu for an added measure is what can be expected . bridget was our bartender that evening , i must say she was awesome , always on the game never missing a beat . i will say even her coworker kept things lively , i want to say his name was mike , but i could be wrong . i did remember he was slinging some great sangria concoctions at the yelp pool party event . now seeing i am a beer aficionado , i pay homage to a great craft on tap , sassafras on the other hand has a small selection on tap . even with the small selections to peruse from , their bottled selections is very impressive , where i enjoyed an innis and gunn by the way . the pregame festivities prior to me enjoying this fine craft i was surveying their cocktail list . the one that caught my attention was their " moscow mule " that i recommend , well everything they make i recommend that is a given . i also decided to peruse a french drop cocktail with absinthe added to the mix . mike , well i am going to call him " mike " for the moment makes this concoction , with a story behind it . the presentation alone in making this concoction will have you mesmerized . a nice glass of liquid licorice basically with a kick you won ' t feel right away . what is more interesting is the glass of ice water given to you for back up , just in case you are not into licorice , it will somewhat defuse that taste . sassafras is an establishment that has a relaxing vibe to it with a few libations along with some great food . i did not partake in the food , but from what i have seen it does look delicious . i also will say this , you might want to go in there during the different seasons , they always have a new blended drinks , to sangria they are displaying . 
eva h . wrote a one-star review below , and i simply have to jump to marigold ' s defense . i had many of the same dishes she did , and the best way to describe it is as a " culinary oddyssey " . my only conclusion is that eva either entered into the experience with the wrong expectations , and or has no taste in food . first of all , to address the price we did not buy into any special " tasting menu " , and were treated to N amuse bouche , on top of our appetizer , entree , and dessert , and the entire experience cost us N-N a head including tax and tip . for N courses , i consider that an extremely competitive price , even in philly . compare it , for example , to bibou , and you will see that they have nearly identical pricing structure . with regard to quality eva goes out of her way in attempting to describe excellent food in a negative way . the " molten rotten cheese " was a N-year-old aged cheddar , and it wasn ' t rotten . either she has no idea what cheese is supposed to taste like , or has a strong need to apply her narrative of " terrible meal " to even the most straightfoward experiences . i ' m reminded of the scene in " can ' t hardly wait " , where william ( who has never had beer ) exclaims , " nobody drink the beer , the beer has gone bad ! " on a similar note , the chilled chestnut ravioli was a big favorite at our table of N . let me set the record straight the food quality is extremely high . i know it ' s my word ( and the words of nearly every other reviewer ) against hers , but the technical and artistic skills on display are world-class , and i base that on my own experience dining at chez panisse and other top restaurants throughout the u . s . a . , europe , and asia . lastly , let ' s talk about pacing marigold is a place you go for a slow , intimate dinner . our meal lasted N hours , and for us this was a feature . we brought two bottles of our favorite wines and found the rate of N-N minutes per course gave us time to talk , drink , savor , anticipate , and celebrate . expert timing . all i can imagine is that eva h . was extremely upset ( and rightly so ) that she was being charged double for a " tasting menu " that offered far less than twice the value . given my N experiences dining at marigold , i cannot imagine it being a worthwhile investment , and i would have found it disappointing in the extreme . the reason for this , however , is only because i so greatly enjoyed their normal dining experience . let me recap that last point loud and clear for those skimming this review if you are concerned that you may not like the tasting menu , please stick to the regular menu ! it has N-N courses , and involves plenty of tasting ! in conclusion , please do not use eva h . ' s review as the basis for your decision on whether to eat at marigold . her tirade has all the signs of sour-grapes whining from a woman who accidentally bought a " tasting menu " no knowing what that meant . i am certain that she had a negative experience , and i am truly sorry she couldn ' t enjoy what they offer as much as i did . however , her single-minded need to cast even the best parts of her meal in a negative light does little to support her review ' s credibility . 
what better to beat the winter blues than a nice bowl of piping hot hand-pulled noodles ? i had high expectations for this place . alas , i was disappointed . what i liked - the noodles ! they are made fresh right in front of you , and they are delicious ! nice and chewy , with a wonderful texture . they are also nicely separated in the bowl , and will not break in little pieces . - you could do a lot worse for N in chinatown . - asians-to-whitey ratio N N . - this place is open until Npm . what i didn ' t like - the soup is pretty bland i had to add mustard greens and sriracha to give it some flavor . - although bland , the soup is very actually salty once i got home i think i drank the equivalent of half the content of the old croton aqueduct , and was still thirsty . - the beef did not have much flavor either . - you could do a lot better for N in chinatown . N . N stars . i think i ' d rather try some other places before coming back here . if you happen to be hungry in chinatown after Npm , however , this is probably one of your best only options . 
this is my favorite afghan spot in the city hands down . i personally like this combo N . aash soup with meat N . sambosa ghosti N . ariana kabab great service , great owner , friendly waitress . 
finally decided to give this place a try . pretty damn good ! we started with some delicious beers and wine . . . . then the octopus came and we inhaled it . . . . i could have fought for the last piece on the plate . next was the pork belly with an amazing pumpkin pur e . i ordered the meatloaf sandwich , luckily it was the last piece in the kitchen , good timing on my part . the waitress said another gal tried to order it and was deeply upset they had run out . . . . to which i said , you snooze you lose beyatch . anyway , my friends had the porker burger and the sensei kris . we all shared bites of each other ' s dishes too . not one bite was wasted , and everything was amazing , succulent , and incredibly flavorful . i highly recommend the cambridge . . . . only thing that prevents me from a N star is the noise level was too high inside , i will have to sit outside next time and then i ' ll up the star count . oh and the service was great . . . . the best in philly so far . we were taken care of every minute making us feel like vip . well done cambridge ! we ' ll be back again and again . . . . and will tell all of our friends to go too ! 
lovely decor , very friendly and helpful staff , noticed by michelin , i wanted to try this place for quite some time and so happy i finally did sunday night . we were in the mood for something light and tried the sampler of eggplant caviar , spicy feta , tarama and tsatsiki and all were wonderful . the grilled octopus was delicious as well and went very well with the crips fruity white wine that our server recommended . perfect place to be for a date or to share a quiet conversation with friends . 
food was nothing to complain about , but nothing to write home about either . sunday supper chicken for N was tasty enough , but everything else was just ok . perhaps i expected too much for the newest iron chef . wouldn ' t return . the place is loud ! 
i went recently and was told the two of us would have to wait N hours ie until N N am . jesus . it ' s pretty decent but why is everyone still freaking out ? yeah it has taxidermy and is at the end of an alleyway , i thought the novelty of that would wear off quicker . guess not . food is reliable but sort of just glammed up comfort food . ie charge a lot for artichoke dip which is just cream and artichoke and cheese . lalalala zzzz
best . fries . ever . the only downside to this fried potato mecca is that it is too small . the line regularly stretches out the door even in the middle of the night . since i avoid standing on line , i often have to live without my precious fries . but that may a good thing . if i could get them whenever i wanted them , i might be N pounds by now . go there and eat . just don ' t hog up the line when i get there . have fun . g
wanted to give jb ' s more stars , but i did not have an enjoyable time the last time i was at this establishment . they always have awesome food . the cuban is outstanding and i love the fries . jb ' s always has some good beers on tap too . the waitstaff is usually extremely nice and responsive , but now to the horror story that was our so-called service . . . last friday night i was at johnny brenda ' s with some folks . my buddy ' s girlfriend ordered the baked mozzarella and she shared that with her friends . we wanted some , so we ordered the same dish . . . but what came out was some saucy monstrosity . the tiniest piece of mozzarella cheese looked like hawaii surrounded by a red pacific . this dish is supposed to come with fried polenta sticks , but we got two crusty pieces of bread instead . the bartender dropped it off and didn ' t even say sorry or anything that the N bowl of sauce was missing one of its main components . . now my complaint wasn ' t about the food , it is more about this horrible woman ' s service . by far the worst bartender server i have ever encountered . when my friend asked her about the dish , she gave him major attitude and said , " most people just take what they ' re given . " most ridiculous shit ever said by someone who works in the food service industry . i ' ve worked at restaurants since i was N , and that is the greatest example of how not to treat your customers . it was cartoonish . oh and i also enjoyed the part when i was accused of bringing my own beer into the bar and then being " flagged " because we complained about our shitty service . your ass should be fired because you turned about eight loyal customers into eight crusty haters . 
really great spot . they have reasonable prices . great pizza and salads and big portions . service is excellent and the place is well decorated . highly recommend for a chill pizza beer spot . also very family friendly as i saw a lot of kids there . 
a favorite
this is by far the best thai restaurant i ' ve been to so far in new york city . the food there is delicious ! service is also good . although the restaurant is always packed , i never have to wait too long for seats . 
the one thing about this place that tops everything else is that they are open til N in the morning . great for those late night early morning munchies . the food is good and prepared fast . the prices are decent . one testimony to the greatness of this place is that it is still packed at Nam in the morning . 
the sandwiches here are outstanding . the balance between the crispy baguette , the pickled radishes and carrots , and the meat are perfect . it is not hard to make a simple sandwiches but to make one where the ingredients compliment each other and the balance of favor work harmoniously together , joju have achieve it . 
every time my boyfriend and i come here we get topnotch service ! food marlin tacos . . . . were amazing . . now they are the smoked albacore tacos . . . same recipe so i ' m sure they are just as tasty ! i ' ve had the salmon , shrimp grits , and the pork as entrees . . . all well worth the money . . . drinks mojitos are delicious along with all of the mixed drinks i ' ve tried , and for after the meal , the hot drinks are delicious too ) ambiance trendy and upscale . . . as soon as you walk in , it feels like you ' re in nyc . you have to at least try it once , you ' ll be very glad you did . 
i ' m baffled by the ratings . we just went there to try a new place , as it was my son ' s birthday and chinese buffets are his favorite . great place . you could tell the crab legs are a huge hit by the large plates people were carrying . i ' m a novice to the crab leg world , and while i had difficulty cracking them open - from what i was able to extract they were quite good . atmosphere is very nice here - we found the place clean , the service attentive , the food varied . i enjoyed all of the seafood . i would say the sushi was a little dried out , but other than that , i thought everything was hot and delicious . we ' d definitely go again . 
best chinese food i ' ve ever had . i can ' t eat at any other chinese restaurant since i discovered this place . dave the owner makes a great drink and the beer is ice cold too ! 
went here for the first time N weeks ago for dinner with a party of N . it was excellent ! the only drawback . . . a little small and cramped , but that ' s what you usually get with city byob ' s . small price to pay . unfortunately our reservation was about N-N minutes late and we had to awkwardly wait in the middle of the place , almost next to other patrons ' tables . had it been warmer ( or not raining ) , maybe we ' d wait outside . the servers were friendly . everything was great . we had the hummus plate and the baked brie . the hummus was great , the baked brie was good , but a little greasy and not very big ( bad for sharing between more than N ) . i ordered the vegetable and cous cous meal - was so fresh and delicious ! it certainly seemed healthy ( hopefully ) . everyone else loved their dishes as well . we split a chocolate dessert - heavenly ! i would return for another meal here . love that it ' s a byob too ! ! makes the check splitting experience a breeze . 
great place for a real homemade breakfast . french toast was amazing . my boyfriend had the ham and cheese omlette and just loved it . our server angelina was perfect . very friendly and was there when we needed anything . 
a hidden gem in noho . my friends who live N mins walk away suggested we meet here on saturday morning for a tasty brunch bloody mary bar . ummm what ? great ambience love the decor , lightning , and the inventive bloody mary bar . you can dress up your bloody mary with any as much of the spices pickles jalapeno etc . they even offer siracha . hmmm for brunch , i had the eggs benedict on crispy parmesan cake and speck . the eggs were done perfectly i hate when they ' re overdone or congealed when cold . these ones oooozed yolky silky goodness- delicious . the prix fixe meal was an awesome deal- N drink ( bellini or bloody mary etc . ) , entree and coffee tea for N . highly recommend in the noho soho area . place was packed with locals , not tourists . also , the restaurant was full but no crazy lines ( ie clinton st baking co ) 
love this place ! best margaritas in town and great decor . friendly staff and always an awesome crowd ! 
for the amount of money these sandwhiches cost , i definitely won ' t be returning . i tried their tasso panini and was underwhelmed by the " spicyness " that it is supposedly known for , plus it was small and not worth the nearly N spot it cost . the pressed baguette the panini came on wasn ' t even cut all the way so all the sandwhich insides were only on one side and were stingy at that . 
grew up with it and always loved it best calzones i have found if in the area and got that hunger feeling stop in you won ' t be disappointed ) 
i would give N starts and a half . food is delicious , service is good . i ordered meatballs but was not aware they were lamb meat - which i dislike . next time , i will try something else . this is a nice restaurant in a very nice location . 
best burger ive ever had . i ordered the chili burger and it was cooked to perfection . ive been here many times and it has been consistently delicious . my go to burger place . 
fresh ingredients , on-house dishes are super delicious ! the owner is very friendly and the service is great . the place is small though . 
ruullllzzzzzz , i would make out with honest tom if he ' d let me . i love his burritos in my mouth ! 
the food is really good . the price is not bad . you should really go eat there . i got a bacon cheeseburger deluxe . let me tell you it was better than the elm diner . they have better prices than the elm diner . the service was was great . the waitress was really nice . she checked to see it we needed anything else . 
i ' ve eatin here N times the food was great N times not so good the other N times . i probably won ' t be coming back . but everyone was friendly i always feel welcome . 
went there a few days ago for dinner , what a disappointment ! ! ! i ordered talapia and it was so overcooked and chewy . my wife ordered chicken and pasta marsala , same drill , pasta cooked for probably N minutes . just disgusting ! ! ! stay away ! ! ! 
it ' s so much fun to go here with friends . i love the everything but the kitchen sink salad . i recommend the classic beef meatballs and tomato sauce . my friends usually order the other ones and they ' re also great ! would get N stars if there wasn ' t such a long wait every time ! 
great food ! ! great service ! ! not a bad word to say ! ! i love the staff they are always so accommodating , willing to make me anything even if it ' s not on the menu ! ! it ' s a must go restaurant if you are in the hartford area ! try the mojitos ! 
this restaurant is simply one of the best italian restaurants in northern nj ! the atmosphere is casual , cozy and comfortable and service is always friendly and attentive . the new menu offers good variety , great value and the portions are large . the food is always cooked to perfection and the veal , chicken , seafood and steak dishes , all of which i have enjoyed over the years , are consistently well-presented and well-above average . don ' t miss the appetizers ! the spiedini is second to none and worth the trip by itself . desserts are good but selection is limited . by the time you get thru dinner , you ' ll be full anyway . this place is great for parties too ! the new lighting system enhances the elegance of the ballrooms and dealing with the owner personally to plan and throw parties has always been easy and pleasurable . discover this hidden gem and you ' ll keep coming back without a doubt ! 
wonderful and tasty food . good and understanding staff . price is okay too . 
i ' ve gone with my boyfriend twice now , thanks to jump on it ! it ' s maybe a bit pricey for us , without the coupon , but i think it ' s great food . they have late hours which i like , and everyone there was also really nice ! we ' ve ordered the green gyoza , agedashi tofu , tempura udon , yakiudon , and vegetable tempura . the green gyoza is vegetable dumplings , which i thought were delicious . i was also a huge fan of the tempura udon . the portions seemed giant ! which was awesome , and totally worth the money ! tasted great , everything was presented nicely . but my one recommendation would be to either eat at the restaurant , or live close by for pick-up when ordering certain things . not a huge deal . . . but the second time , our tempura was a tiny bit soggy when we got home ) still tasty though . 
quite good . affordable , fast and very tasty . good chicken and beef burritos and tacos , and they have amazingly good sauces . definitely recommended . i was not expecting to be impressed , and i was . 
went back again for dinner with some girlfriends yesterday , we had the sangria it was absolutely delicious ! ! ! would recommend to everyone ! 
by looking at the outside it can be a bit intimidating hole in the wall . fear not this place is really a gem . the two brothers ( chef waiter ) are excellent people ! very caring and treat you like family . my wife is filipino and she gave it two thumbs up for it ' s authenticity . prices were very reasonable even though the menu was a bit sparse . on my way to the bathroom i looked into the kitchen it ' s tiny ! this i presume is the main factor for the limited menu . why is N star missing ? the sister came in toward the end of our meal . as we were settling the check and taking some food to go she literally snatched one of the menu ' s from my possession and told me " why are you taking my menu , your not supposed to have that ! " . apparently it was a friday saturday menu , not the regular menu . she didn ' t even talk to her brother ( the chef ) who gave it to my wife as we were inquiring for our next visit and future larger purchases such as lechon . this tainted an overall great experience and changed the mood instantaneously . i kept my cool out of respect for the two brothers . it was also an anniversary dinner with my wife . please note it ' s cash only . we shall return and hope our follow up visits shares some of the other great reviews for the sister of the establishment . best regards , j
amazing atmosphere - they announce a greeting to every guest - all the waiters and cooks " sing " a type of hello whenever someone new comes in . full of japanese diners so you know the food is authentic and excellent . amazing sushi , sashimi , and other cooked japanese dishes . my only advice is not to waste your time money stomach space on a " set " , just order a la carte dishes . sets are big trays with a bunch of useless sides - the main courses are what you want . small place in chelsea neighborhood . amazing ! 
eldridge steet has some good dumpling restaurants and the ones here are right up there with the best of them ! the restaurant has a sign that is bigger than the restaurant and the people working there speak limited english but then again most of the customers speak chinese . prices are as cheap as it gets but the quality is up there . very limited seating but there are parks nearby , so take out is always an option . 
before my last experience at silk city . i was raving to my friends about this place . i would have given it four stars . their thai chilly wings are the reason i kept going back they are soooo good . and their hippy friendly vibe made me feel comfortable . my last experience has changed my mind and is seems their popularity has weaken their concern for quality customer service . after enjoying a show case on the bar side . my two girlfriends and i went to the food side for a quick bite and a girls night . so three brown skin girls on a tuesday night it ' s not busy and its about eleven ' ish . when we sat down . water was served when my friend noticed something floating in her water . she asked the server if she could have another water . the server was hesitant ( maybe she didn ' t hear ? ) . but the way she reacted and her non-verbal ques where not warm and accepting . my friend even questioned if the server truely got her a new water . we brushed it off . without looking and the menu my friend and i ordered the wings and she orders fries for us to share . i had been to silk city about five times before and knew i wanted wings and fries . it was my friends first time and our other friend ordered a desert . when the food came i was surprised to see that their was cheese on top of the fries . i explained to our server susan that i forgot that it came with cheese as i am lactose intolerant . i also explained that i am normally asked by my server if i would like the cheese on top or to the side . susan went on to say that i could dig thru the fries and find the un- cheesed ones on the bottom . i ask if we could have the fries replaced . she said we would have to pay . really over some fries ! ! ! ! i would nerver think i would have to write a review over fries . ohhh it gets better . we ate our food i was famished and the wings thou a little cruncher than usual where finger licking good . i ate them all while the fires sat their untouched . all the while having a great time with my girls . i couldnt get the fries situation out of my head . i have been in the customer service feild for a while and this situation just rubbed me the wrong way . now i know their is a strong yet mostly true stereotype that brown skin people don ' t tip . i am brown skin and it is mostly true . but i try my best to combat that stereotype and i normally try to leave a least N or N which ever is higher . maybe susan saw brown girls and decided she didn ' t give a hoot about plastering a warm smile on her face . ( on principle , in the end , we still left an average tip which was more than shady susan deserved ) so asked her manager ( i wish i had gotten his name tall skinny male with glasses ) hoping that i would at least get the fries taken off . so i explained to him exactly as i did susan . we went to the kitchen to consult with susan . came back and told me that since i had been their before i should have known that the fries came with cheese . but this one time he would make an exception . along with a gesture that looked like it was very difficult for him to take the fries off . ummm yes we are still talking about fries not a steak or the most expensive item on their menu . fries . the principle of understanding customer error does not exist at silk city even when it comes to the cheapest thing on their menu . now i understand that it was my error in not memorizing or reading the menu . because i assume that when i order fries i just get fries and i am reminded of extras . but the way this situation was handled is exactly how some restaurants start loosing bussiness . silk city has gotten one star for customer service and the extra star was because i did acutally enjoy those wings . i hope the cook hasn ' t turn into a pretentious hippy snobb either . 
everything my girlfriend and i had was delicious , we go often and try different places out , this one might be the one we will definitely go back to . 
food was allright - not the best fish tacos i ' ve ever had , but also not the worst . the service was really bad - the waitress could not hear a thing and went out to smoke after we ordered drinks ( and did not return until the cook went out and yelled at her ) . radio mexico was much better when it was in this spot . 
i rarely get around to writing reviews due to my own forgetfulness , but had to make extra effort to express my opinion of this place . we ordered the brussels , shrimp bun and miso soup with pork . all i can really say is that the richness of flavor blew my mind . never had anything like it . absolutely delicious and will make you seriously consider ordering seconds . whether you ' re into this genre of food or not , you owe it to yourself to check this place out . the space itself was intimate , friendly and attentive staff . we were seated right away and were in and out in about N min . this was lunchtime on a monday . 
i love the oxtails with rice and peas . so so so good ! that ' s the only dish i order ( it ' s that good ! ) . i highly recommend this place . i only wished they weren ' t cash only .
