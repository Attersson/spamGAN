57915,162172,1250,9/4/2013,i ' ve been searching for good lamb in nyc and i finally found it ! Nrd and Nth ( the halal guys ) is so overrated . these guys do chicken lamb so much better than all the places in manhattan . perhaps it ' s because these guys are from astoria . anyhow the chicken is always fresh and the lamb is amazing but filling and i do feel like taking a nap afterwards . get here early because they leave before Npm most days . line gets a little long during lunchtime but it goes quickly .

57919,140648,2634,11/13/2014,"i ' ve been here before and went back again last night--the food was very good , as usual . two people got the zuppa di pesce , a seafood stew . some places skimp on the seafood this was not one of them ( and for a very reasonable price , too ) . huge bowls loaded with a whole variety of seafood , and plenty of broth for dipping with bread left over . other things we ordered were the octopus salad , brussels sprouts , and duck entree--also both tasty . only two negatives to comment on . first , while the brussels sprouts were delicious , as they ' ve been every time i ' ve gone , it seemed like the portion size had been reduced ( it ' s been a while since i last went , but even if not , the portion was still quite small ) . there were about N halves , and while they were huge brussels sprouts , i ' d still expect a bit more . it ' s not like they ' re expensive in any way . second , it was fairly loud . we were there around N-Np on a thursday . you could still hear across the table , but even being a small place , it was quite noisy . they were also playing music , not loudly , but seemed a bit odd , considering . one last positive we hadn ' t made a reservation and called around N N . there was a group coming in at N , so they said we had to be finished before then , but i thought it was noteworthy that they were willing to squeeze us in . last thing to note they only take cash , so make sure to bring some . overall highly recommended .

( N ) the menu prices in the restaurant did not reflect the menu prices listed on the website . i think that this is an extremely dishonest way to conduct business . finally , when we got our bill , which averaged N person ( for our bowls of pasta and sauce , which probably cost less than N to produce ) we saw that there was a predetermined N tip built into our bill . we assumed that there would be a fixed gratuity because we were a party of N , but we didn ' t know that it would be N . additionally , and outrageously , the bill was totally illegible and impossible to decipher , and our "" tip "" was based off of the price after tax . in other words , we ended up tipping on more than N of our food bill because our tip was calculated on top of the tax . i go to restaurants to eat food that is better than what i make at home . i also don ' t like to feel like i ' m being taken advantage of , especially when i ' m paying for food . roberto cafe should be more careful with the way in which it describes its dishes on its menu and in how it calculates its bills -- tip and tax are always calculated independently of one another . if i could give this restaurant zero stars , i would .

N ) nori ( or seaweed ) used in the maki application is that of a rare kind that ' s grow in japan only during seasonal months . the crunchy seaweed found in most other restaurants is that of imitation grade . N ) the wasabi used in each application is derived from that of a smaller horse radish root , thus allowing for a more concentrated and potent taste .

58435,203005,3459,9/22/2013,"i stay with a few friends here in vermont when i can come for the summer , so i waited until the end of summer before writing my review so i could give an accurate honest assessment of my experiences there instead of one great stop or one truly horrible one because all kitchens have good bad days and i wanted to give a true picture of my overall experience since i experienced both in this cute little country store now that it ' s not a gas station . it ' s always been a quaint little place that has a homey , real country feel to it , it ' s usually quite relaxed ( occasional squabbles in family run places are to be expected but still , whenever i heard chaos coming from the back , i ' d leave because i wanted food , not tantrums and theatrics ) . i stopped in frequently it was conveniently located on rte N and i passed by it nearly every day . i liked that it is quaint , homey , and the array of flavors for the soft serve is incredible with cost being relatively reasonable . one truly unique offering i ' ve never seen anywhere else was that sometimes one could get a soft serve twist with something other than the standard black white if the person taking the order knew how to do it ! i loved that i could watch the process of it being made ! their prices are a bit steeper than some of the local competitors , but , their ice cream competitors don ' t offer the selection of soft serve that these folks do , either . it sort-of reminded me of a mini whistlestop ( a previous summer fav of mine some years ago , before they closed ) . the variety of product under that roof is nothing short of remarkable , and it was overwhelming - even confusing- when i first went in , but as the summer progressed i figured it out in the time it took to prepare the orders once i went from strictly ice cream and ventured into the foods section since ordering from the food menu usually meant a lengthy wait . if you ' re in a hurry , i ' d strongly suggest calling ahead . . . and if it ' s really busy you still might end up waiting a bit . being laid back is all part of the charm of the country , though , isn ' t it ? i checked out a couple bbq menu items due to the great reviews i ' d seen from others . had i stuck to the ice cream , the number of stars would be much higher , but the smell from the bbq deli selections had my belly growling for real food . things went downhill once i strayed from the ice cream menu . the first incident , i chalked up to a bad day in the kitchen . the sandwich i ordered was a pulled pork bulkie with "" the works "" , which means pickle , onion , cheddar cheese and cole slaw with this store . it was served on a burnt roll , rock hard black . i couldn ' t eat the bread but the pork was fairly good moist hot , with a sauce that tasted good , but it also tasted familiar , like a product i often use at home . the noticeable difference being theirs was a bit sweeter and had a thinner consistency than the brand i buy ( i had asked for extra on the side was obliged with a smile and a "" no problem "" ) . some of the "" works "" were noteworthy , too . the store smelled of sauteed onion that day , so i agreed to them when asked what i wanted on it . if offered regularly , i only timed it right that one day because that was the only time i received what truly tasted like sauteed onion - after that , asking for the onion , they ' d be hot but seemed to also be somewhat raw . the hot slaw had me raising my brow too , but i did eat it . i can ' t say it tasted "" good "" or "" bad "" but in my mind , slaw is a cold product it didn ' t seem right to be eating it hot . i was worried i might become ill , but i didn ' t it was simply odd . . i also tried ribs at one point and the smoked loin ( really yummy ! ) and even the brisket beans , but veered from the bbq after trying all but the smoked loin - that ' s something i ' d have tried again . sure , everything was tasty enough , but like i said , so similar to what i can do at home that i decided to stick to the sandwich menu save the money i was dropping on bbq . the deli sandwiches were piled high with the fixin ' s - of which there were several options to choose from ! the rolls were soft seemed fresh ( even for the hot options , i would have stuck with fresh instead of toasted , hoping to avid the previous experience ) , but as with the ice cream , portion seemed to vary according to the person making it for me . . . so did the quality . i stopped ordering from the deli after finding hair in one of my sandwiches . the owner did compensate me but after that , i stuck to the ice cream if i stopped . very friendly staff most days , and willing to accommodate several of the customers with special requests , based on what i ' d see as i waited . . . but there seemed to be a good deal of confusion , disorganization and on more than one occasion , chaos . due to the soft serve variety , yes , i will go back when i return next summer , but it ' s pretty much a given that i ' ll be sticking to ice cream menu if i stop .

( N star ) however , when i finished eating the fish cake , i tasted something funky which reminded me of scaling the fish , and my stomach started to hurt . then came the agedashi tofu . i like how they laid the tofu flat on a small plate to make it easy to eat with a spoon . however , the sauce was way too sweet with not enough daikon radish and the serving was very small . the sweetness was sickening . while sitting at the bar , i kept getting my back bumped or slid by wait staff and patrons which was a bit annoying . i think i will come back here to try their sashimi and other izakaya item to be fair . i really want to like this place because the staff was very attentive and i was happy with the service . however , the food which made my stomach ache and was seasoned wrong simply does not make sense to return to . perhaps i was unlucky on a october monday night .

58641,100012,3618,8/17/2011,"my Nth review , let ' s break out the champange . and as much as it pains me not to save this slot for a local restaurant in la , i have to give to nod to this exceptional ny destination . after much anticipation and hype ( about a year ) i finally had the chance to return to nyc and make a reservation for the famed momofuku ssam bar . being of korean descent i ' m familiar with the traditional bossam ( ) pork lettuce wrap dish that ' s found in households all over the homeland . chef chang does his original spin on the lettuce wraps and makes it the centerpiece of his flagship restaurant , but more on that later . taking my group of N out for dinner we showed up waiting for a table to open since ssam bar will not take reservations unless it ' s to order the bossam , which requires a party of N-N guests for sharing , otherwise they will not honor the time slow if you show with fewer people . after enjoying a few drinks in the space formerly occupied by the milk bar ( now relocated across the street ) we had a table within half an hr , within full view of the open kitchen . ssam bar ' s menu offers a varied array of small plates and full size entrees which can be enjoyed solo or shared family style , with directly asian influenced dishes to those that reflect more chef chang ' s personal tastes . despite being unable to ' reserve ' a bossam for the night ( they only make so many per night ) a cancellation left an unspoken pork shoulder which we ordered immediately . opening the dinner we tried a few items among the small bites steamed buns ( N ) - a pair of chinese style char siew bao with tender , crispy pork belly , hoisin sauce , cucumber and scallions . juicy and plump , if you ' re dining at ssam on a budget , these are a must try . kushi oysters ( N ) - raw oysters garnished with violette mignonette flowers , clean and fresh tasting , not realizing we had more oysters to come , definitely enjoyed these . chili soft shell crab ( N ) - served with green tomato , garlic and lemon confit . crisp , juicy and tender , i always love soft shell crab when it ' s in season and this doesn ' t fail to dissapoint . now onto the main event . as previously mentioned , bossam is traditionally served as steamed thin pork slices seasoned with raw garlic , pickle , onions and chili paste and wrapped in lettuce . rather than being a main entree , it ' s often enjoyed as an accompanying dish to late night drinking . david chang takes this working class food to another level by keeping the seasonings the same but using an enormous multi-lb lump of slow braised pork shoulder as the centerpiece . for the price of N ( be sure to share this with as many friends as possible ) , it doesn ' t fail to dissapoint visually and taste . . . let ' s just say as soon as the meat fell apart at the touch of the serving tongs , i understood what the hype was about . as a lover of slow cooked pulled pork of all varieties , this had to rank among the very best and despite the stratospheric price , i still consider it a good deal , especially given our group of N could barely finish half of the meat along with the wraps and accompanying oysters ( yes , more shellfish ! ) and split up the rest as leftovers which lasted days . sometimes one has an exceptional meal that not only defines an night , but in my case , an entire trip and momofuku ssam easily makes its mark in my memory for years to come .

59325,181088,2983,5/18/2013,"i went to the belgian cafe last night with a group of friends , having been here once and enjoying the food immensely . went again last night , and everything was just a mess . we were waited on by a waitress with an attitude problem who didn ' t want to seem to be there at all . our orders were wrong or missing entirely . i had to remind her about my burger which wasn ' t put in at all apparently . that problem could have been avoided if she wrote down our orders instead of trying to play super waitress . there were quite a few people , it ' s understandable if you can ' t remember it all . a few people at the table ordered burgers , and when my friend received her medium rare burger , hers came out more ultra well done super hockey puck style . being a server herself , she doesn ' t really send food back unless it was inedible . it was not edible . after the table was eating for a bit , i inquired about my burger and was given a blank look , even though the surrounding people , including my husband heard me order it loud and clear ( and the only person at the table who just ordered without having her ask how i wanted it , what sides , what burger etc ) . my burger came out , before my friend who sent her burger back and when i bite into it , i almost gagged . i cannot , will not eat rare burgers , it ' s just a personal thing , which is why i order medium-well but instead got a burger so rare , it was practically mooing . i just gave up and just gave the burger to my husband to eat . my friend who sent her burger back got one that was almost as rare , almost to the point where it wasn ' t cooked at all , just thrown on the grill , flipped and slapped on a bun , almost if it was a punishment for sending the food back . well , jokes on them , she actually prefers burgers that way but tries not to eat them because of health reasons . other than the food issues regarding the burger temps , the food itself is quite good . the problem is the servers , they just seem nasty and have a bad attitude . look , i know my friends can get loud and rowdy , but most of us have worked the service industry and try to make life as simple as possible for the waitress and tip really well if we ' re happy , N minimum . hell , even if you give just the basic service , you still get N . even among the servers , we were debating if N would have been too much . i think last night will be the last time we go to belgians and just head into the city instead and go to monk ' s , where we were at least greeted warmly , received drinks in a timely fashion and received what we ordered .

"" , he never judged us . i wish i had remembered his name -was it eric , erin , or maybe even sean ? - the best i could describe him is how he looked and that is a tall slender blonde man with short hair and spoke with a bit of a lisp . if you get him , you ' re in for some real great service . the bus staff were on the up and up as well as they were sure to check that our table was clean - even if it was just a single grain of rice on the table . the dinner selection was quite nice and just about everything on the menu seemed quite appetizing - but my craving for seafood kicked in and i zeroed in on the paella which did not disappoint at all . it was a great portion and the seafood was abundant - the whole dish was cooked to perfection . my guest was also having a great time as well as she ordered the vaca frites which she just simply wish she had more room in her stomach for . for those of you interested in the alcohol selection , i simply couldn ' t comment because my guest and i were decidedly having an alcohol free night - i know , a sin to do such a thing at a latin establishment . finishing off the entire meal was a sorbet my guest and i shared and it was amazing . three different flavors - coconut , passionfruit , and mango - each had its distinct flavor , and they all worked together to provide a great sensation on our tastebuds . summary - price it may seem a bit pricey for some , but with the portion that is given with the quality of food proves that entry is definitely worth the price of admission - d cor it ' s somewhat fine dining with a casual twist . the environment is lively but you ' ll still be able to hear yourself . a good place for a date - food at times abundant , the food here is simply great . it ' s savory , its sweet , it can be spicy . . . it ' s latin ! notable mention calle ocho does what many others have had a difficult time doing - having a fine dining latin experience that is festive , with professional service and an excellent menu with amazing results . giving a perfect score has never been this easy .

60055,7440,4481,2/17/2013,"in the philadelphia area asian markets and restaurants often find homes in cinder block constructions that once served another purpose . the corner establishment at Nth and washington is just such a place . a yellow awning with bright red letters announces a grocery store , raymond ' s music and nam so ' n . don ' t be intimated by the locale . park your car where you can and prepare yourself for one of the best vietnamese restaurants in the city . nam son is not a distinct building . it is nestled among a row of varied shops along the inside arcade that leads to a vietnamese grocery store . open the door to nam son and you can see by the clientele that this restaurant certainly meets the dining demands of philadelphia ' s vietnamese community . while there is nothing elaborate or particularly decorative in the d cor , the restaurant is clean and open . tables are spaced within several distinct areas . the back room with its open window seems best for large families . the small section to the right suggests quiet and would suit dinner for two . the middle section is generic and works fine for lunch . nam son ' s menu is fairly extensive . it takes some time to make your decision . if you are not familiar with vietnamese dishes it would be good to ask for help . even with some idea of the offerings , i find it good to ask for suggestions . our first choice was the pho . you cannot eat at a vietnamese restaurant and not have pho . today we selected the deluxe . for our second dish the duck salad seemed interesting . for our third we selected rice paper wraps ( bahn ) . wraps are another essential at a vietnamese restaurant . we opted for grilled pork . for our final dish the clay pot pork and shrimp was too tempting . as usual , ( if you read my other reviews ) we asked to share and we asked to be served one dish at a time . the server was most accommodating . the large bowl of pho was certainly enough for three or even four . the broth , rich and dense , was certainly one of the best i have enjoyed . the meats , plentiful and diverse , complemented the hearty and teeth grabbing noodles . gelatinous strips of tripe melted easily and contrasted with the still pink beef strips . has any culture created a soup so warming , so satisfying as the vietnamese pho ? as we finished the first serving of the pho and were setting out our second serving ( the large pho bowl easily offered enough ) , our server brought us our next course , the duck salad . seeing that we were still working on the soup and remembering our request for one dish at a time he noted that he would have the kitchen move a bit more slowly . if there is something that distinguishes vietnamese food it is the use of fresh , bright and crunchy vegetables . vietnamese dishes are light , robust and shimmering with vibrant taste . the duck salad , easily shared by three or four , sparkled on the tongue . the tiny strips of carrots and greens tussle your taste buds from gustatory indifference in the way that your hands wake a reticent child from sleep . our next selection , the vermicelli rice wraps did not quite match the menu . there were no rice paper wraps . we questioned the server and within seconds , several others appeared and confirmed that there was indeed an error on the printed menu . without a moment of question , they immediately offered to correct the mistake . the eventual grilled pork wrap was quite good , although perhaps not exceptional . our final course , clay pot pork and shrimp , takes the tongue and mind to another world . if you are brave enough , you can include the red chili that sits atop the dish . i have not yet managed that level of vietnamese food . move the red chili garnish to the side and plunge into a wonderfully intense dark sauce that sizzles and bubbles hot and alive around shrimp and strips of pork . clay pot , along with pho , must be the greatest creations of vietnamese cooking . from the moment we entered the staff at nam son attended to our every need . our servers immediately corrected errors in the menu . fresh plates and new chopsticks greeted every course . even after we said that we would keep the same utensils , the server insisted on new ones . the price for a wonderful sunday lunch with four courses for three people was less than N . once again , don ' t be put off by location and immediate impressions . nam son offers one of the best vietnamese dining experiences in philadelphia .

( he ' s the second annual celebrity sighting , after last year ' s literal run in with phillip seymour hoffman . ) we occupy a large rectangular table just past the front entrance . unlike those found in cheaper restaurants , balthazar ' s entry has both outer and inner doors , ensuring that we avoid the constant gusts of N degree air as patrons show up N or N minutes before their reservations , anxiously awaiting their tables . once we are seated there ' s nary a misstep in the service . when my wine glass reaches a third empty , it is refilled . when i knock over a vinegar sauce , one waitress is there with a cloth napkin dabbing it up while another brings over a fresh portion . we move through courses with the perfect mix of patience and elegance , everything appearing exactly when it should . while my salmon was fine and mango and strawberry sorbets excellent , the most memorable part of the balthazar experience is the titular seafood offering , the meal ' s very first course . le grand balthazar is three towers , each with different but overlapping finger foods . on the bottom layer are clams , oysters and scallops , cracked open and ready for a one bite gulp . while the oysters and clams are served plain on the half shell , some of the oysters are also mixed in a mini-pico de gallo , with onions and tomatoes and several spices . it elevates this sometimes bland protein into a well-balanced amuse bouche . the second level has a few clams , but it ' s mostly crab legs ( long and fleshy and ready for dipping in butter ) with a secret ceviche center . the rings of lemon-lime marinated squid could be the highlight of the whole tower . lobster is the king of seafood , and most of the tower ' s lobster is on the top tier . i joked around the office for weeks that i and fellow tall people would use our long arms to grab the most expensive meat and finish it off before the shorter people could get any . in the end , however , i was so distracted with the ceviche that i waited until we had one tier left before diving into the dish . the seafood tower is now a holiday tradition , our manhattan equivalent of a yule log . maybe someone will leave one in my stocking come christmas morning .

N . pork bun - so neat ! it was fried pork belly ( love it ) wrapped in a traditional steamed pork bun in a kind of taco-esque form . i ' m such a sucker for gluttony and pork belly and pork buns so this combined my loves in one cute package N . korean bbq satay - definitely my second favorite of the evening . the bulgogi wrapped around succulent and delicious korean bbq was divine . seriously get this all the time . and the staff was super kind and threw an extra skewer on there so we could all have our own . how nice ! N . crispy calamari salad - realllllly good . the calamari was fried perfectly and tossed in a salad with a really nice vinaigrette and apples . you wouldn ' t think it would mesh well but trust me - get this . N . brussel sprouts - i eat brussel sprouts religiously so i would ' ve loved it anyway but it was neat having it in fish sauce . yum yum yum N . chilean sea bass - divine . it was perfectly prepared and fell apart as soon as the fork touched it . complemented with edamame puree and a pico type thing and it was just amazing . my favorite part of the meal . the staff must ' ve loved us because dessert was sent out for free ! chocolate-blueberry ice cream and strawberry-vanilla ice cream on cute little cones skdjfslfsd i want them all the time . do not pass these up ! the staff was amazing . attentive but didn ' t hover at all . the manager knows how to run the place , that ' s for sure d decor is really chic and hip . the walls change color too ! also check out the bathrooms - they play clips from movies in there on loop ! do yourself a favor and find yourself a lovely date and go here . you will not be disappointed , i guarantee !

60793,230116,1679,3/17/2011,"i am well aware that not every restaurant can be a fine dining experience or a paradigm of culinary integrity . i am also well aware that for someone who has dined on some of the finest sushi this country has to offer , attempting in any way to compare the makizushi ( which i am not a fan of in the first place ) or nigirizushi one can obtain in a strip mall to that of said sushi is simply unfair . as such , i will not attempt to make any such comparisons . i stopped here for a quick lunch and ordered one of their noodle soups that were advertised on a white board near the entrance to the eatery . it is worth mentioning that while they do serve the soup , it is nowhere to be found on their actual menu . in the end , i would have to say it ' s omission is for the best . in true nagoyaka ( and one might even say niigata prefecture style ) , the eating space is cramped and tight , composed almost entirely of an l shaped sushi bar and two or three other chromed tables cluttered around its perimeter . this may sound negative but it truly is not , both ramen and sushi houses are more times than not tightly built and meant to simply serve the food , not necessarily provide a place to eat it . upon inquiring about the "" noodle soup "" i was told by the server that it was "" udon "" and came in beef , chicken , tempura or vegetable . i ordered the chicken variant and the shumai appetizer . the shumai was filled with the common vegetable cornucopia and while the actual wrapper was poorly composed , the filling was seasoned well and quite scrumptious . sadly the same cannot be said for the main attraction . i received not so much a soup as i did a salad stew . various micro greens covered the top of bowl as did a genuinely liberal amount of chicken . i will give nagoyaka credit for the quality of their chicken , at least in regard specifically to this dish . the slices of chicken were clearly cut and prepared freshly , not grilled or charred then flash frozen . this is appreciated but cannot make up for the rest of dish . the broth of the soup was most assuredly pho inspired as i could detect absolutely no hint of dashi in the base . in addition , coriander , fennel and distinctly thai basil notes were most pronounced , together with noodles that , while thick , were rice based and not soba , pushed this soup as far away from being a "" udon "" bowl as possible . judging it as pho , it fails to live up to the basic tenants of that particular dish as well . in the end one should take my review in context . i have not sampled the makizushi available here and as such cannot comment on its quality or flavor profile . taking what i have said into account in reference to their "" noodle soup "" however , i would urge one to be deliberate and cautious with their choices off of the sushi menu .

60929,196701,4112,2/13/2014,"my girlfriend and i have been to park central N times now and are big fans . we have sat at the bar twice and have decided that is our favorite atmosphere in the restaurant . i usually judge a bar by whether a place can make a manhattan correctly and this was probably the best i ' ve had in quite some time ( also stirred and double strained - not shaken ! ! ) . my girlfriend had a drink that i think was called salt and smoke . it was a combo of mezcal , pisco , cucumbers , fresh lemon , and salt - don ' t quote me on exact ingredients . the drink was phenomenal and all of the cocktails on the list looked very innovative and had a great focus on seasonal ingredients . the draft beer list was refreshing , and you could tell that they spend a good deal of time selecting the choices as nothing was mainstream , but there were good local alternatives . i like to try new things and this is a great place to do that . the only problem seems to be that the majority of the crowd didn ' t feel the same and was content drinking bud bottles . changing the local crowd is very hard to do , but i do not think this place is going to hit it ' s full potential if they cannot get their regulars to try the ' brand ' they ' re going for . to move onto the food some of our favorites after our N visits have been oysters on the shell - they had N different kinds to choose from and the bartenders were very familiar . the cucumber mignonette was something different and the oysters were certainly fresh . the fire islands were our favorite ! steak burger with jalapeno relish was smokey , savory , and juicy . fried chicken was ridiculous and had some kind of truffle honey on it that was addicting . truffle oil can be overpowering when used in the wrong place but the balance with the sweetness of the honey was just stupid ! yum ! we have also enjoyed an asian inspired special with udon and a kung pow duck confit leg , which showed just how versatile their chef is . besides the drinks and food the live music on saturday nights is great and the service is very homey and warm . there was some acoustic band that was there a few weeks ago playing some americana , blues that made the night . i don ' t see why park central is rated so low on yelp . maybe the restaurant doesn ' t quite fit the neighborhood ? we go out at least once a week and park central is now in our top N list of restaurants in new haven area . thanks and cya soon ! !

"" "" yes , i scored a reservation , so get dressed and look good . we ' re catching the train in half an hour "" . fast-forward to us arriving at balthazar after braving the lirr , penn station , and the slush and ice of the city streets . ahhhhhhhhh . entering balthazar , you are in paris , new york , and heaven all at the same time . the place is buzzing with waiters and patrons , and it has that old-world feel of an institution that has been there for years . the high ceiling and huge tilted mirrors on the wall are incredible , and reflect the many tables and booths of all varieties of people hovering over wonderful plates of food and engrossed in conversation . for starters , bruce ordered his favorite dish of all time , the goat cheese tart . oh my , it was so good and creamy , with caramelized onions adding to the richness of the dish . garnished with house-made sundried tomatoes and a smidge of tapenade , you could easily make a light meal of it with a soup or salad . simply perfect . i had the steak tartare . best ever . generous portion of the most tender meat , perfectly seasoned , with lightly toasted crostini and a mixed green salad . god . i could eat this dish by the bucket . bruce had the beef stroganoff for his main . talk about comfort food - home-made broad noodles and butter-soft beef in a rich creamy sauce . i would definitely recommend it on a chilly winter ' s day . i had the grilled trout - entirely upon the recommendation of the server . how she convinced me to eat a fish that i normally don ' t care for is beyond me , but her description sounded so delicious that i could not resist . and she was entirely , entirely correct . the fish is grilled to a crisp , with a balsamic reduction on top , all sitting on a bed of baby lentils and vegetables . i enjoyed every delectable bite . everything at balthazar is always wonderful , down to the bread and butter . there is a reason it is such a popular hot spot - not because of trendiness , but because their food is fantastic and the wait staff is excellent . you will sit close to your neighbor , but enjoy it . we ended up meeting a wonderful couple who we talked to for a full hour after finishing our meal - the perfect cap on our experience . like the ultimate pair of prada shoes , dining at balthazar is something special to treasure . a bientot ! p . s . the cookbook is available for sale , and features many of their classic recipies including the goat cheese tart .

N . the salmon teriyaki is cooked in such a way that it ' s moist and tender on the inside , and firmer , verging on crispy , at the edges . the marinade is brushed on in just the right way so as to inflame the meat with flavor but not overpower your palette . the salmon must be seared somehow as well , because there ' s a beautiful , subtle smokiness that fills your mouth as your jaws clamp down for that first chew . even at much higher end places , i have never tasted better , heartier salmon teriyaki than at sakura , and that is saying a lot . there ' s something else that must be said , and it ' s that the chefs -- brothers -- are two in a billion . one has a goatee one is bald . one is single one has a family . both are extremely politically incorrect , and each has his favorite customers . and if you dare or care to chat each of them up , funny and dramatic stories will unfold , i guarantee . whether it ' s an act or just some good old-fashioned fun , i appreciate that their personalities and antics make dining here a cozy , fun , and memorable experience that never really gets old . i ' ve graduated from princeton now , moved to the west coast , and only go back to visit once in a blue moon . but when i do , i always go back to sakura -- to be greeted by friendly if slightly mischievous smiles from both chefs , more spicy tuna than i will ever intend to eat , and a whiff of years of great memories spent with friends .

61407,29284,3215,7/23/2013,"di fara is the godfather of pizza . i am honored to have been able to try probably one of the greatest pies in the world . just the fact that he makes each and every pizza shows how much he cares about making phenomenal pies . i am still finding an excuse to make a trip back to ny for the sole purpose of getting di fara ' s . i made a trek out here on a weekday right after work . i arrived around N Nish and the doors were open but "" roped "" off . it was my lucky day though . . . a lady , i ' m guessing one of di fara ' s daughters , came over to me and told me they were closed but that she would be glad to take my order for when they reopen . i was blown away because she offered to make whatever pizzas i wanted . . . my eyes lit up in disbelief and i said back to her , "" wait . . . so you ' re telling me i can choose the next N pizzas that di fara is going to make ? "" she replied with a laughing smile , "" yes . "" i felt a little overwhelmed at first from the excitement but i gathered myself and decided on a regular cheese slice , pepperoni , the grandma ' s slice with sausage and mushroom , and a grandma ' s slice with just cheese . . . ( lay off i was starving ! ) after ordering , i walked around the area just trying to find things to do to keep my mind off the greatness that was to come . i got back in line at about N Npm and there were about N people ahead of me . but little did they know that di fara was in there making the next N pies for me . . the line got to about N deep . finally , the gates of heaven opened up , the heavenly music was playing , and i see god himself , mr . di fara , trimming the fresh basil onto my pies . ( that actually would be my ideal heaven . . . di fara just making pies for me ) N ) the cheese slice - cheese combination was amazing . crust was cooked to perfection . not cracker-like , not too chewy , and not wet . the best part was the sauce . the tomato sauce is so good and refreshing even . and the fresh basil on top just sealed the deal . N ) pepperoni - very interesting . never seen this type of pepperoni before . they look like little cups or suction cups . i like them better than the normal flat thin pepperoni slices b c they have more flavor and are actual chunks of pepperoni vs . thin slices . N ) grandma slices - same quality of the other cheeses and sauces . the tomato sauce is perfect . not too sweet but very tasty . the blends of cheeses just melt in your mouth . and the best part , the crust ! i preferred the grandma slices because i loved the crusts . the crusts were cooked perfectly . almost looked burned but tasted amazing with a slight charred taste that i like . next time i am getting a whole pie . wait , make that N whole pies . . . i ' m a man of my word . i was truly in my own world enjoying these slices . and i felt so bad for the other people just waiting in line just salivating , waiting for their turn to take a bite of heaven . great service . smaller joint so i dunno if i would recommend coming here for a nice sit down dinner . a in my book and for sure my favorite . since then , i have recommended this place to anybody i know that is in ny . i can die peacefully now knowing that i have had di fara ' s . mr . di fara , i would be more than willing to drop my job and be an apprentice for you just to learn the ways and continue making pizzas the di fara way ! ! just saying . . . let me know . . .

61444,20918,4080,10/6/2013,"shortly after taking up cocktail-making at home , my enthusiasm for cocktail bars waned , this being so despite limiting my bar circuit to the highest tier of quality . a recent visit to toronto ' s interesting barchef reinforced a feeling that even as better bars proliferate in nyc , truly exciting ones have not . it was my loss to have ignored the opening of the dead rabbit earlier this year . it doesn ' t help that its located about as south as one can go in manhattan , fidi , generally a wasteland for food and drink . make no mistake , unless you happen to work in the area , a trip here will be a trip made especially to come here . and be mindful of heading over on an early weekday what passes for an excellent time to visit most bars elsewhere for quiet and the bar staff ' s full attention , will get you a raucous roomful of suits instead . the dead rabbit , which takes its name from a notorious Nth century nyc irish gang , is ambitious in its intent to elevate what most new yorkers think of as an irish pub . the first level is the taproom , a warm , narrow space festooned with old black and white photos and dominated by the large , handsome bar . seating is mostly limited to the long row of bar seats and a small table by the front window , with much use made of the standing room . they have an appreciable list of spirits , a selected rotating list of mixed drinks , and a reasonably good list of beers and wines . they distinguish themselves and stay true to their ambitions with a list of improved highballs , bottled punches , and pop-inns the latter is new to me and is described as an ale spiked with liqueur . upstairs is the parlor , yet another handsome space with full bar and a few cozy seating configurations . service is well-dressed , poised , and friendly . here , the dead rabbit shines in its complete embrace of an era of mixed drinks preceding the more popular prohibition-era focus found in most cocktail lounges . the extensive , hardcover bound menu is brought with a complimentary punch , served in a dainty tea cup and saucer . in classic punch fashion , it is bold , each flavor competing with the other for prominence . it is a worthy prelude to their mixed drinks , and much needed when there are six dozen drinks in all to peruse . even moreso when every other drink introduced an ingredient heretofore unfamiliar to me . there ' s a baker ' s dozen of tinctures ( rhubarb root , angelica , eucalyptus , tansy , sage , quinine , mace , pine needle wormwood , woodruff , and celery ) , sherbets ( lemon , orange , and clementine ) , preserves , housemade sodas , plentiful spices , and teas in their punches . to my delight , even the veteran cocktail enthusiast will find much unfamiliar here , a welcome feeling indeed . the drinks are grouped by types , such as flips , cobblers , punches , sours fizzes , and juleps smashes . here again , i don ' t recognize quite a few , including bishops , fixes daisies , invalids , and possets . sourced from very old recipes but interpreted for the modern palate , the dead rabbit hits all the right notes and creates incredibly delicious drinks . the first sip of the sophisticated porterberry seized me and simply didn ' t let go . this mix of islay scotch , navy pusser ' s rum , strega , porter , ginger , lemon , and soft butter resulted in a a drink that was tantalizingly smoky , with a full , rich mouthfeel and layered flavors . the ale flip marries sixpoint ' s dead rabbit ale with whiskey , nutmeg and sugar , with a spiced egg batter for a foamy top . looks like a coffee , tastes far greater than the sum of its parts , smooth and complex . the refreshing whiskey smash a la terrington is cooling , easy-drinking , and wonderfully balanced , as is the pretty red cup , a port wine and brandy based drink leavened with lemon sherbet , lemon juice , red currant preserve , and cucumber soda . the food menu is worth a look , although i ' ve yet to delve much into it . bar snack standards done well include fresh oysters on the half-shell , steamed shellfish , cheese and charcuterie , fritters , pate , and scotch eggs . larger dishes emphasize english and irish roots , with various savory pies , fish and chips , bangers and mash , and corned beef sandwiches among the offerings . note that "" the grocery "" in their name isn ' t simply for show in the back of the taproom is a corner with dried goods , salumi , and cheeses for purchase , a homage to such a practice in ireland . here too , their own dead rabbit orinoco bitters , based on an old formula and liberally used in their mixed drinks , may be purchased . the dead rabbit has leapt into the top of my cocktail bar list . it is indeed worthy of the trek to fidi . i ' ll be revisiting as much as i can to explore their fantastic mixed drink menu .

61655,148446,2235,12/2/2010,"it is important to know that while the restaurant calls itself "" pan-asian "" cuisine , they primarily serve filipino food ( most or all of the people working there are filipinos ) . secondarily , they serve thai food , followed by a few miscellaneous dishes you ' d find in other asian-american restaurants . i only ordered the filipino food , so i can only speak to that , but as a filipino-american , i can say that the food is not only authentic , but often upscale of what you ' d get in a home . i ordered adobo flakes , pancit bihon ( "" pahn-seet bee-hone "" ) , vegetable spring roll , and halo-halo . all were more than excellent , particularly the adobo flakes . my least favorite was the vegetable spring roll , as i felt it lacked a certain body in the flavor . a lot of filipino food is accessible to american tastes . the bulk of it is meat marinated in soy sauce and some sort of acid ( vinegar or a sour key lime-type fruit called calamansi . . . don ' t be afraid ! ) , served with rice or noodles called pancit . different variations of pancit exist , and the name generally derives from the type of noodle being used ( see their "" delicious noodles "" section it ' s all pancit , even if it ' s not called that ) . if you ' re new to filipino food and not an adventurous eater , stay away from the filipino specials section . ( not that the food in that section is bad , but that ' s the only part of the menu that might scare away picky americans . ) if you ' re new to filipino food , try these suggestions lumpiang shanghai ( appetizer ) , anything barbecued or with pork for an entr e ( pig philippines cow united states ) , sago gulaman for a drink ( kind of like bubble tea ) , and either turon ( fried plantain ) or leche flan ( the same thing as spanish flan ) for dessert . or you could order halo-halo , which is only slightly less accessible ( generally you won ' t find beans and ice cream together in an american dessert ) but actually my favorite filipino dessert , hands down , and very well done , here . do note that while the desserts are expensive , they are also quite big and can easily be shared . the filipino food here is excellent . i highly recommend you give it a try some day .

62015,25313,3259,10/28/2013,"i ' ve been going to ippudo for years . let me just say i ' ve been to many ramen places in the nyc area , and the ippudo franchise i feel has the best ramen to offer . i can ' t even count how many times i have been to the other ippudo at east village . that establish has a over N reviews . . so i ' ll review this one ! this location at the westside in midtown is a nice alternative to your ippudo craving . it opened earlier in N and the interior has a different feel than it ' s east village counterpart but ( so far ) i notice that the waits are shorter . only thing that may give you a long wait is if you have a large party ( of around N people ) because they only have N large table to accommodate a party that size . as for the food , if you have to wait for a table , do yourself a favor and try the pork hirata buns . the bread they use for the buns is so soft and the pork is delicious with the sauce they use . for the main course , if you are new at ippudo , the best bowl of ramen to try first is the akamaru modern , a pork-based ramen with some garlic flavoring . this is my favorite bowl of ramen to have when i have already tried their special ramen . there are different times of the year where the special ramen they have on order changes . specials are a wide-variety and i suggest reading what is contained in the ramen before getting it . these special ramens are very unique and are interesting to the taste-buds to say the least . let me just say though , if they offer a wasabi special ramen ( not the non-meat wasabi ramen on the normal menu ) , do yourself a favor and try it if you can take the wasabi flavor . this special bowl of ramen ( that had meat ! ) made me instantly fall in love with this place . the other bowls of ramen i like on the menu are the shiromaru hakata classic and karata men ramen . as for ramen toppings , i personally like spiciness , so i always get the bakudan ( ippudo ' s spicy sauce ) . you get an amount of it that is shareable with others , so not everyone has to get the sauce if they want to try it . also , you cannot go wrong with a poached egg ( onsen tamago ) in your bowl of ramen . finally , you meat fans can get extra chashu pork in your bowl of ramen along with . . . . . very very good braised pork belly ( kakuni ) . the kakuni here tastes awesome and you will not regret getting it . now here is the main reason why i enjoy ippudo very much are the noodles . the noodles here taste sooo fresh and they are made al dente . it ' s hard to describe it , but you can taste the freshness of the eggs in these noodles somehow . because i enjoy these noodles so much , i always get a "" kae-dama "" , which is an extra order of fresh noodles that are made which they give you after a few minutes to add to your bowl of ramen . as a suggestion , if you do plan to get a kae-dama , do not finish your entire bowl of ramen soup ( don ' t go slurping all of it yet ! ) so you have enough soup base to submerge the new order of noodles and essentially have another bowl of ramen ! finally , i have to say that the service here was top-notch . i personally drink a lot of water during my meals and the server was very attentive and i did not have a time where i was lacking a refill on my drink . also , the server was very friendly and would take the time to chat with us , which is always great . if you want to try a good bowl of ramen and have not been here , please do yourself a favor and come here . yes the prices are higher than many other ramen restaurants in new york , but in my opinion , it is worth it !

N minutes is entirely too long for a burger of that size with no french fries . add another bartender to the staff so that milkshakes don ' t come out with warm whipped cream and liquid at the bottom .

62516,51122,3048,8/20/2010,"the only reason this review isn ' t just one star is that the service at zinc is genuinely excellent . our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful , very attentive , and never pushy . it ' s a shame it just so happened that she was knowledgeable about middling , even bland food with sky-high prices . the short version is this zinc puts together too many flavors and ingredients - in my dish , some sort of shrimp with spicy curry and about seven other different competing tastes - so that rather than interact in any meaningful way they create chaos on your palate . not in an offensive way , but rather , you can hardly remember a single individual taste from your meal . in my meal there was rice , two or three different sauces of some kind , curry , vegetables of another kind , etc . the only good thing the shrimp was fresh . for a N dish that just doesn ' t cut it . my fiancee had to suffer through a positive maelstrom of things piled around her duck . it was like zinc was determined to show you how indian , french , spanish , and korean food could all co-exist on one plate . unsurprisingly , the attempted co-existence was more like a flavor war , and no one won . surprisingly , many of the "" ethnic "" flavors were cloying and overbearing . the ingredients themselves were of varying freshness but the quality was middling . the duck nachos , touted by some , were sickeningly sweet and absolutely flavorless , with mere strands of duck - hardly trimmings - on each nacho . the steamed pork and ginger dumplings could be found in your local grocery store in the frozen foods aisle . korean barbecue smoked duck breast was the maelstrom i wrote about above , and the duck was overcooked . indian shrimp was the shrimp i wrote about above , so no need to rehash . yet the bill was that of a high-quality restaurant . over N per person with a couple drinks apiece . the funny thing is that zinc might actually be an above average if they stuck to three or four thoughtfully applied fresh ingredients and flavors instead of a dozen . but at the moment they ' re a wannabe high concept place with failed execution , phenomenal service , and high prices . i ' d take good execution over the phenomenal service any day .

62694,18771,4414,11/18/2013,"i ' d like to preface this review by saying that my gross displeasure is aimed directly at the host manager ( his name was chris ) and not at the waitstaff barkeep , nor the food ( since we never sat down ) . i grew up in williamsburg greenpoint , having gone to elementary school at the now defunct ss cyril and methodius catholic school on dupont street , i was excited to visit a part of my childhood and to see how the old neighborhood had changed . it was my friend ' s birthday , and i had been saving glasserie on my to-do list for a nice occasion . i booked a N N reservation for my party of N on a friday night . having read many good things about glasserie , it was certainly a partly selfish endeavor . i appreciated its vegetarian friendly fare , although i was certainly amped up to order the rabbit that i had read so much about . we arrived N minutes before our reservation , and i was surprised to see how busy it was considering its industrial location and how far away it was from the center of williamsburg greenpoint . i don ' t consider myself to be unreasonable when it comes to bad service . i put up with quite a lot . wrong orders , long wait times , screwed up bills , etc . i understand , we ' re all only human . the food comes first . but what we experienced friday , was pretty abominable . first off , upon entering the restaurant , there was no one to greet us or check in our reservation . we noticed a large group of people crowding around the angle of the bar , but no host . we stood around for a few minutes , before we noticed the small desk near the back . no luck there either . finally , after standing around for a few more minutes , i worked up the nerve to grab one of the plaid-shirted waiters and asked them where the host was to be found . he told me that i have to stand around in the front "" to be noticed "" . okay . so i did just that with my confused party in tow . after a few minutes of standing around in the front , the host finally materialized . i had to approach him and i would ' ve only had guessed that he was the host by the pen and paper he was holding in his hand . i had told him that i had a N N reservation , and he quickly mentioned to me that he was N-N minutes behind schedule . it was N N already , but okay . no problem . N N pm rolls by and i ' ve noticed that the large crowd of people standing around the front of the bar have almost completely cleared out by now , all of them having been seated . my party quickly noticed that the walk-ins were seated before us as well . my buddy humorously pointed out that "" they must have had N N reservations . "" ha ! the bartender was quick to pick up on the situation , and he treated us to some complimentary drinks . kudos to him . he had lovely facial hair . that ' s when i tracked down the host again ( because we had the feeling that we were being almost completely ignored ) and he reiterated once more that he was behind schedule ( now N minutes behind our reservation time ) and was going to seat us at the little community table in the back . i had replied that i had booked a reservation and that i would appreciate not having to share a table with other guests , especially for my friend ' s birthday . no apology offered there either by the host , just a nod assent that we ' ll be seated at another table . back to the bench we went . to their credit , we were offered N of the lamb croquettes , i wouldn ' t know how they tasted since we were a party of four . that ' s when i had enough and we left . i felt like i was watching a bad tour of "" restaurant wars "" via a top chef episode . i ' ve never walked out of a restaurant before , and it was a real shame because i had very high hopes for chef sara ' s food . it was the worst front-of-the-house service i ' ve ever witnessed . however , many thanks to casa enrique for a great night !

62718,57050,2864,2/22/2010,"i ' ve always thought that scarpetta sounded like the name of a villain . it ' s so sibilantly similar to scarpia , scalia , slytherin . . . . maybe those associations are why , after all these years of hearing rave reviews of this restaurant , i still hadn ' t gotten around to trying it -- until tonight . we walked in without any difficulty around N N , without reservations , and were seated in the front room ( where , evidently , people without reservations are relegated ) . our table was a bit unpleasantly close to the wait station -- right next to it , in fact -- but the space was still quite attractive and far enough from the door that we weren ' t getting hit with blasts of cold air each time it opened . i have to confess that i did love the front room ' s farmhouse chic , its variegated wood walls and cast-iron light fixtures . we started with the yellowtail crudo with ginger and sea salt and the chestnut soup with root vegetables and beef cheeks . both were quite good . yellowtail was a nice study of textures , with crunchy sea salt and microgreens contrasting nicely with the well cut , tender , fresh fish . there was just enough acid to brighten each bite and not a bit more . chestnut soup was rich and earthy -- a lovely wintertime dish . for my main , i had the sicilian-spiced duck breast with preserved orange and roasted root vegetables ( actually carrots , endive and beets ) . the portion was small , clearly meant to be eaten after a larger , belly-lining pasta course , though sufficient for me . the meat was extremely tender and beautifully , perfectly seasoned , but prepared very rare without the wait staff asking me how i wanted it cooked . i personally love my meat bloody , but probably not everyone enjoys duck that way . in any event , i thought the dish was excellent . i do wish i ' d ordered something more assertive to go with it than my quartino of pinot nero . it was a N , but was pale , watery and tasted much younger . didn ' t try the so ' s housemade spaghetti with tomato and basil , but he loved it . we finished with a nuanced , light , refreshing dessert of coconut panna cotta served with guava "" soup "" , caramelized pineapple and a scoop of coconut ice cream ( or possibly sorbet ) . panna cotta was a lovely texture , almost as tender as dofu fa , and the guava soup was not overly sweet . the coconut ice cream tasted of the very essence of coconut , but avoided being cloying . it was a great dish to end a rich meal , though not entirely seasonal . it ' s pretty clear that the kitchen is able to put out beautifully made food . some might take issue with the portion sizes , which are designed to be part of a four or five course meal , though i personally do not . i wasn ' t thrilled with the two wines off the wine list we tried that were available by the quartino quality to price ratio seemed to be much lower than it is at mario batali restaurants . but in all honesty , at this point , it ' s too early for me to have a well-informed opinion i ' ll have to do a lot more , ah . . . .

( read broke college student ) the standard bowl was three meatballs for N and it you wanted pasta or a side it was going to cost you an extra N , each . hell , no . so in the end , i opted for the compromise which was the pasta dinner for N which came with N meatballs and a choice of sauce and pasta . the lady behind the counter listed what i thought would be my choice of meatballs , chicken , beef , pork and veal but instead told me the meal came with a blend of all four meats . interesting . my bowl came flanked by two pieces of what i assumed to be garlic toast but really was toast , dry and brittle , with the thought of garlic . the generous serving of sauce on the other hand spoon was fantastic , rich and savory the deep red color stood out against the brown whole wheat penne and left a definite garlic tomato taste in my mouth that was accented by the sharp taste of locatelli cheese , a hard salty italian cheese . the meatballs on the other hand were rather confusing and the blend of the meats did not sit well with me as they left me guessing as to what they should taste like . as they say too many chefs spoil the broth and it was unfortunate that the highlight of marabella ' s meatballs were not her meatballs . dear marabella , i ' ll get my people to call your people ? xoxo moaf",3,-1,marabella meatball co .

64094,35427,2232,8/30/2013,"i have been looking for a great place for coffee and breakfast downtown and i think that the kitchen at billings forge at the hpl is a welcomed addition ! i had the spinach and tomato frittata , ham and swiss brioche , and a large coffee . i am a big breakfast person in all senses of that phrase ! the coffee , the dark roast , is nice and well-balanced . it is on the lighter side of dark roast , it could pass for medium roast but i won ' t hold it against them since they called my attention to that nuance when i ordered . but as i take another sip while i am typing this , i can taste the crisp annunciation of bitterness of dark roast as compared to the pronounced heaviness of french roast . the frittata was very flavorful , no need for extra condiments , the fresh tomato did not make it soggy and flat , it had a nice mousse-y , sponge-like texture expected of a well-made frittata . in fact , it made me wander into musing of souffle and meringue ! the ham and swiss brioche was enjoyable as well . my baseline comparison is my grandmother ' s brioche just to give context . the kitchen ' s brioche was a bit heavier than i would like brioche to be . it ' s an amazing bread that it should have the lightness of cake but the heft of an artisan loaf when it is perfectly executed . this came close but maybe a few more minutes to let the dough rise a second time . i also bought lunch , a barley salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette . can ' t wait for noon or one o ' clock ( since i am soooo full from breakfast ) to have it ! i ' ll give the update as soon as i am done ! i usually bring my lunch but if i don ' t , this will be one of the top places i will go to ! my recommendation would be to get your orders to go and eat outside while you can . under the calder sculpture at the wadsworth is really pleasant .

N favor taste is a fantastic deal in chinatown nyc and is fully deserving of it ' s N stars . we ordered a ton of food from the extensive hot pot list , then doubled it up with a ton of meat to grill up on the open face table-top grill . there is a sauce bar where you can combine your own flavors for dipping delight , or you can use some of their pre-made sauces . the quality of the meat was pretty good , though not really steakhouse levels . some of the meat was slightly overcooked , some was a bit to sinewy , some a bit too fatty , but most of it was cooked well by our table attendant . the hot-pot was great as we were responsible for cooking that ourselves . beware of the spicy broth ! it has a numbing spice in it that kinda makes your mouth feel a little funny , but not in a totally bad way . only that it will affect the way you taste other dishes . i would start with your bbq and non-numbing spice broth , then hit that last .

N west coast oyster happy hours ftw ! ) . the bent spoon sea salt caramel and vanilla ice cream ( N ) was all right but not amazing , especially for the price , but a good complement to the chocolate chip bread pudding ( N ) ! piping hot , smooth texture , decent amount of chocolate , not terribly sweet , and a reasonable portion . i wanted to try the tiramisu with coffee cookie ice cream but i was already full halfway through the entree . next time . the locally-bottled dragonfruit drink was the worst thing we had , especially compared to everything else , one of those sugar-substitutes-plus-small-amount-of-sugar soft drinks . with almost no dragonfruit , it tasted like gatorade , not exactly a good pairing for seafood imho . the cappuccino was good , not too bitter . came with a sugar crystal swizzle stick . you don ' t see this very often anymore makes a nicer presentation than sugar packets . two unisex restrooms , tiny but clean , with shiny , new-looking fixtures . would definitely go back . i plan to bring my parents , as my mom is a lobster bisque fiend and it was one of the better iterations of this dish i have had anywhere .

( both the owner and server ) i went to this place very often because the food here is affordable and pasta is fresh - usually with my husband . one day , my father came to visit me from korea . i took him to this place . at the checkout , i was about to sign the check without paying much attention as usual , but ( fortunately ) realized that the price was higher than expected . i asked for the check with each item and found out that they added N tip without telling us , and then gave us the second check which required another tip ( as if they did not add tip in the first place ) . what was more deceiving was that on the second check , the amount which included tip appeared as a "" pre-tip amount "" . it was only two of us - not even a group of N . next time when i went with my husband , they did not include tip in the first check . so we thought they probably made a mistake last time . a few days later , i went with my father again . they did the same thing - tried to make us pay tip twice in the same deceiving way . we realized that since we looked like tourists who don ' t know much about tipping , they tried to rip us off . i gently explained the owner about the situation . to my surprise , her reaction was extremely impolite . i remember how kind she was to us when we looked like locals , who can possibly be repeating customers . however , the way she dealt with this issue was completely different - perhaps she thought we are tourists who have little chance to come back . if only she had apologized , we wouldn ' t have made this such a big deal . i cannot trust food made by people who lack morality . they may have made a few more bucks by deceiving tourists , but have lost what is most important - trust .
