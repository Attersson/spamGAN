i don ' t like you mario because you have completely commercialized yourself , but lupa has a very good bucatini dish , that i often find myself dreaming about . appetizers are delish as well , and quite large for ny standards . 
whether you are there for a quick lunch or to spend an afternoon sipping wine with friends , this place is perfect . i am a fan of the wine flights , brie en cro te and the gorgonzola fig bruschetta to start with . and later , after i find the right wine for my mood , some fresh fruit and cheeses . . . that ' s just a good day . knowledgeable staff , nice atmosphere and great place to sip and pick with friends . i look forward to my next visit . 
my family enjoyed a nice meal and birthday celebration at the tap house . all of the staff was friendly and helpful from host to waitstaff . we had great beers , a fine malbec , appetizers , salad and pizza . everything was d-lish ! we usually hit church street but it was refreshing to have service without the hipster attitude . 
you wouldn ' t know it , but this tiny little shop is a must visit in nyc . perfectly done fries ( the belgian way ) with way too many dipping sauces to try . everything comes with european mayo , pretty difficult to find in the us . seating might be limited , but its just fries so people come and go quickly . next time i gotta try the poutine , but i was a big fan of the horseradish sauce . 
barbuzzo is a trendy hot spot with good food and even better ambiance . the place is decorated beautifully , which really struck me upon walking in . there ' s a natural-earthy-woody feel there , barn-like doors planks on the walls . . . it felt homey but also updated and very chic . the food was good . . . though unfortunately being gluten free at barbuzzo leaves something to be desired . they can totally accommodate you if you ' re gf , but the pizzas and pastas looked nice and i ' m sure they ' re great ( just couldn ' t try any of them as gf pasta was not on-hand ) . i really wanted this arancini risotto on the menu , but was told that it ' s actually fried risotto balls and could not be made gf . bummer . on the other hand , we had some nice entrees to share . the vegetable board featured N prepared veggie salads which were all unique and interesting to taste try . we then had the swordfish , short rib and octopus calamari dish . swordfish was done perfectly - moist , steaky , with tomato pesto on top - delicious . short rib was good . . . could have been better ( i love short ribs , i wanted more sauce on this ) . the calamari was grilled , fresh , good . . . but nothing special . definitely have a cocktail . my date has basil lemonade ( vodka , housemade lemonade , torn basil leaves ) , and i had the sanguinello , which was blood orange deliciousness ( ketel orange , blood orange puree , chambord , lime ) . our cocktails were great , and i could have easily had more , but then i would ' ve been tanked . prices are pretty reasonable for a place of this caliber in center city . the dishes are served family-style , but this is by no means a tapas portion . N dishes per person is plenty . also note - if you don ' t eat pork , this may not be the place for you . a lot of interesting dishes had tons of pork and or lard and or shellfish . . . not exactly kosher . ) 
great pizza . kinda grimy , but what do you expect from eateries on N ( jersey city stretch ) . the ambiance is that of a jersey pizza joint with cops patronizing , pot hole filled parking lot , N ' s cash register , and a pizza owner speaking spanish to his workers . with that , the pizza is very good . most pizza joints ( roughly N ) in the north east tend to taste like cardboard . whether they can help it or not , that ' s usually how the end product tastes like here in jersey and new york . that ' s right , i said new york . this place makes a good slice . 
i went to reading terminal where they had everything you can think of . fresh produce , deli , cheese , coffee , baked goods , olive oil , dutch , amish , indian , italian , american , asian , and so much more . then there was tommy dinics . i remember going the day before and saw the line to be endless , a reason i had to come back and try it out . i was not disappointed . ordered a roast beef with provolone and broccoli rabe , a tasty grease filled hoagie . i loved it . the broccoli rabe was soaked in a big pan filled with marinade , cooked well done . it brought out a very pungent smell , but tasted great . just like a durian , smells like shit but it ' s good . what sets this apart from genos and pats ? the thick slices of beef and cheese stuffed in between the bread , overflowing with broccoli rabe . i couldn ' t wait to get home and finish it up . i will be spending time in reading terminal the next time i go down . 
the place looks nice but its very loud and the service was not so good . the food itself was mediocre and the price was way to high for the quality . we had the lobster and shrimp with fries and fried vegetables . the lobster and shrimp was over cooked . the sauce was too creamy and the vegetables was way too oily . we didn ' t stay for desserts . 
a coworker of mine and i decided to take a walk here one afternoon for lunch after reading an article on huffingtonpost . com that mentions this as one of the top and most eaten sandwich shop ' s in the country by master chefs . there is a baoguette much closer to our office which we frequent often for vietnamese sandwich ' s and figured that if this place is supposed to be that good then we must visit . first off , actually eating here was very difficult . not because it was hard to find or looked bad but rather because is it next to of the food or look of the place but rather because it is right smack in the middle of some of the best restaurants and eateries in little italy and passing them up as i walked here was very hard to do . that said , if you can manage to make it hear without filling up on your way , then the trip is definitely worth it . these sandwich were on par and better in certain aspects - the bread was toasty and warm as tasted fresh baked - than with every sandwich i have had at the baoguette by our office and for half the price ! the only reason i gave it N stars opposed to N is because their is very limited seating which is know is but of the nostalgia but nonetheless disappointing . 
what took me so long to get here ? wow . obsessed . the food is phenomenal - not just the pizza , the salads , everything . the servers are super friendly and nice . the space is great because they accommodate people while they wait - great outdoor space and all that . loveeee
good atmosphere to have a drink and relax with freinds , food is ok . i can ' t add anything else that hasn ' t been added already . 
love their breakfast options . have gone here many times and i ' m never disappointedly . great coffee and expresso . maybe not the quickest of service but i find it ' s well worth the wait . great place to come and leisurely grab brunch and hang out . 
service was terrible . 
just had a great lunch ! my lunch partner and i received a friendly greeting and speedy service . we were quite pleased with the pulled pork sandwich . . . great flavor with just enough " kick . " salad was very good , too fresh crisp greens . perfect portions . looking forward to trying more from the appealing , widely varied lunch menu . 
okay . first of all , this place is good for kids , and not too dressy . i come here all the time after tennis , wearing a t-shirt and shorts . second , everything is amazing ! ! i ' d reccomend the fried rice or any type of chicken . ( heavenly chicken is indeed , heavenly ) . 
if there were a way to give this place N stars . . . i would . for those of you who have left the area and are writing with fond memories of this place . . . you should see what has happened to it now . my boyfriend and i ordered take out from papa frank ' s last night . he had the veal parm sub and i had the eggplant parmigiana . the veal was at best freezer burned , if not dangerously old . you should be able to cut through veal with a fork , but we had to get out a steak knife to get through this . after one bite he decided he would rather not risk food poisoning and threw it out . my eggplant parmigiana was a mushy , tasteless mess . the sauce tasted mostly of ketchup and tomato paste with no herbs or seasoning . the pasta was at least cooked properly , but was inedible drenched in that sauce . the ' garlic bread ' was nothing more than a hot dog roll with some oil and parsley on it and toasted . that was tasteless as well . my boyfriend is not from this area and i had told him that papa frank ' s used to be a fun college hang out and the food was good , basic italian fare . i was completely embarrassed . this was not the papa frank ' s that i remember from years ago . what happened ? a change in ownership ? or has this place simply been there too long ? either way , avoid this place at all cost . if you are craving italian food go to olive garden . their food may come out of a can , but at least it ' s edible . 
finally made it to pyt after a few months of hearing about their amazing burgers , and i my expectations were met . even on a busy friday night , we got a table and our food quickly . we had a fantastic waitress , sarah , who not only did a great job keeping the pyt specials ( N for a high life pint and a shot of jameson ) comin , but she also put up with me and my friends obnoxious behavior , which is always appreciated . overall a good experience , but it was really packed and hard to get around , kinda have to yell to hear one another , but i guess thats just about any bar . 
one of the best meals i ' ve had in a while . really great menu - creative and novel without being forced . went with my boyfriend on saturday night and waited just N minutes for a table . had cocktails at the bar and some snacks - herb roasted almonds and olives . yum ! the service was fantastic , both at the bar and once we were seated . our waiter was attentive without being too in-our-face . we shared the foie gras , which was omg amazing . he had quail ( a special ) and i had duck , and they were both delicious . i really appreciate food that tastes great without being super strong in flavor , and prospect delivered . dessert was a deconstructed s ' more , which literally made me melt . overall , a fantastic dining experience and a great evening . 
went with my girlfriend for a nice romantic dinner while i was visiting her at princeton university . at first we were sat in the middle of the room ( kind of awkward ) , but as soon as the large party taking up all of the back tables left , the owner immediately came out to ask us if we wanted to move so it was less noisy and more cozy . . . and that was before we even got the food , the service alone is enough to warrant at least N stars ! i ordered the greens gennaro -- fantastic , little bits of sausage and prosciutto and italian greens sauteed together with some oil and sprinkled with cheese , simply amazing my girlfriend ordered some penne pasta with chicken , tomatoes , peas , mushrooms and a balsamic cream sauce ( that was no where near too creamy ) - this was also fantastic , it wasnt over sauced and didnt need too much because of all the tomatoes in there adding their own juices to the already delectable mix i ordered the veal osso buco that was a special that night with saffron risotto - this was superb , fell right off the bone as osso buco should , had just the right fat content and was so soft it melted in my mouth - and as is proper they even provided me with the mini fork in the bone to scrape the marrow out afterward ( delish ) if you ' re in princeton and have not been here - you ' re missing out this is now going to be a regular spot whenever i ' m out visiting my girlfriend
i have been there so many times over the years . had some good meals there . i have only had maybe one bad experience where the tuna burger tasted old . i told them . and they were very good about it . made me something else . 
i am not into cheesesteaks and pretzels so i take out-of-towners here for a trademark philly meal . totally delicious . 
for me this is the best type of place . you can feel the love that the owners have for their gem . i love korean food and the this bibimbap made me very happy . service was spot on . fried chicken and waffels were fantastic ! will be going back . 
outstanding . great authentic russian ukrainian food . being polish we ate quite a few of our favourites . . . borscht , herring , potato latkes , and perogy . sergey had perfect recommendations . we had a lovely tour of the restaurant including the banquet room upstairs . price was superb . portion size excellent . even better we had a lovely russian gentleman beside us as well as a businessman from taiwan . they were both extremely intelligent and worldly . . . great conversation ! ! ! tried the horseradish vodka . . . gotta do that one again . we will be back . 
great spot . simultaneously hip and unassuming . casual atmosphere with great cozy vibes . went here for brunch . ordered the avocado benedict . the brioche wouldn ' t have been my preferred bread choice , but it was scrumptious to say the least . also ordered a bloody mary , beermosa and mimosa . if i had to chose just one perfect brunch drink i would go with the beermosa made with ommegang witte . check . it . out . 
N - happy cinco de mayo ! upon entering toro loco , our senses were immediately stimulated from the robust scent of the sizzling fajitas passing by to the fun atmosphere . people all around were parting hardy , while some promo girls were handing out free t-shirts , little mariachi ' s and other cool giveaways . i ' m new to the area and just met oscar , the bar tender , who was so friendly and very helpful in choosing just the right mexican beer , xx lager , which i had never had before . it was so good that i might now be addicted . while at the bar we started with some appetizers , such as guacamole dip and freshly made salsa with home made chips . we also ordered some enchiladas and shrimp in garlic sauce ( if i was home i would have licked this plate ) . so far it sounds great doesn ' t it ? well , let me tell you , it gets better . after being seated for our main course , i initially thought i wouldn ' t be able to eat another thing , but with a little break in between , all of us were ready again to experience a feast . we started out by celebrating with some frozen margarita ' s , probably the best around , we couldn ' t resist so we ordered a pitcher . while at the bar , we took the advice from another patron to try the clam soup and the whole red snapper with mexican spices . being a group of four we also ordered the fajitas toro loco to share and omg we just wanted to devour it all . here we were sharing all our meals , and me thinking , that i wished my friends would have continued being a little more social with the guys from seton hall , just to allow me to selfishly eat it all . we really indulged with the fried ice cream and - oh my - you have to experience this , it couldn ' t be better . i have to thank our server too ( i think his name was eric ) for immediately getting me some club soda for a spot on my shirt . this was the absolute best time tonight made us feel like we were back in cancun . will definitely recommend to all and will be back for more . 
the kitchen looks like it needs a good scrub , the cook was cooking meal after meal without so much as cleaning anything , he was using the same towel to wipe the counter , the griddle and the cutlery . there was nothing special about the food , they were so rushed that i got the toast N minutes after the eggs ( at which point i was almost done ) . wouldn ' t return here ever , there are other better places around the area that would treat you better . 
had gone for superb drinks before and had gone to dinner with marginal results . drinks are fantastic ( hands down on par with little branch etc ) . went for brunch yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the food . we sat int he garden in tank tops ( the sun really heats up that place ) and it was wonderous ! i had the cornmeal pancakes with sweet cheese and bluberries ( amazing ) and sampled the strata ( very good ) and two eggs over polenta mix ( delish ) . compliments from my table on the eggs and bacon as well as french toast . would def go back ( which surprised even myself ) . service was great as it was my friends birthday they really took care of us and even offered us a free tarot reading . 
not impressed at all with the food anymore . not sure what is going on but when this placed first opened i real enjoyed it . i got a california quesadilla yesterday and it was a beef one . they put the beef inside the tortilla and they put the cheese outside the tortilla on top ? i have never seen a quesadilla with the cheese outside it . the place is hit or miss at best depending on what you order . 
this place was really cool and the people working there are not uptight new yorkers . the host girls were friendly and made us feel welcome when i took my boyfriend on saturday night for his birthday . we asked our waiter zack ( who was also really cute ) to pick the dishes and wine and he did it perfect . the venizon was the best and they put a candle in the desert that made my boyfriend feel very special . the prices are not so expensive and you can take free soap from the bathrooms . i would definitely go back as long as i bring earplugs because it is so loud ! ! 
my husband and i frequent blue ribbon and we are always more than satisfied . we usually get the surf and turf , friend chicken , salmon or oysters . anything you order will probably be great . it is a tad expensive but well worth the money . staff is always accommodating and welcoming
great spot on austin st . for happy hour with wine cheese . loving their mac cheese and olives with glass of wine on a friday night . have come for brunch as well and it ' s pretty good ! 
you gotta choose and i ' ve chosen pats and never regret coming here . its greasy , meaty goodness . i ' ve been to the non " tourist trap " places in philly and they are not that great . only if you want all kinds of bells and whistles with your cheesesteak . me , i ' ll stick with the main event . give me steak , whiz , w onions . and pat ' s makes it best for me . there is always a line so you really have plenty of time to figure out what you want , also the menu is pretty straight forward , cheesesteaks . being from nyc i understand the no nonsense attitude of the staff here . when there is a line of drunks stretching down the block there really isn ' t time to answer N questions about the age of the of cheese and consistency of the steak used here . just order and keep it moving , there are people waiting . to avoid a bad experience know what you want , order , pay , and eat it . 
came here with my boyfriend on a saturday night for dinner . the venue was beautiful , hostess staff very friendly , and the scene was filled with N somethings in a very intimate romantic atmosphere . we ate off of the prix fixe gilt city menu here ' s what i had Nst - pa amb oli ( a . k . a . bruschetta ) Nnd - ceviche canaro ( yellow fin tuna ) Nrd - rosejat rapida ( vermicelli , cockles , chicken , chorizo saffron alioli ) dessert - melocontones en costra ( spanish nyc version of a peach cobbler but better ) it took a little too long for our waiter to notice us , but after eating the first two courses that included some of the best ceviche i ' ve ever had , i had totally forgotten our initial period of ignoring . the cabernet and cabernet-merlot blend by the glass were very good , as well . while i am normally a b ( u ) y-the-bottle person , a glass was included in our menu . my boyfriend had ordered the bass which was to be substituted with shrimp , and when bass came out versus shellfish , our waiter was so mortified that he brought out shrimp in addition to our two plates to apologize . we attempted to insist that we had enough food already but he wouldn ' t hear it we were both happy he overruled us as the shrimp were tremendous . after dinner we tried to figure out what kind of cuisine we had just eaten . it wasn ' t specifically mediterranean , but more than spanish . . . at any rate , we agreed on " deliciousness " and expounded on the depth of the pasta dish and the very satisfying yet not too heavy meal we had just devoured . i would absolutely come back here ! i would love to try additional dishes that were not included in the menu we were limited to , and see if we could get a table in the back garden to eat outside before it gets to cold to eat al fresco before the retractable roof becomes permanent . 
great hell ' s kitchen spot for brunch . small . bustling but not overly packed . feels neighborhood-y . had the lobster and bacon frittata ( but i had it with sausage ) . delicious . coffee was stellar . my man had it hot , i had it iced . both were great even for a snobby coffee drinker . didn ' t have the biscuits . but other tables did and they looked yum . just wasn ' t sure i wanted to spend another N on top of my N frittata . if i had any reservation about putting the marshal into regular oration it ' s simply that it ' s a little pricy . and the portions aren ' t huge . quality is there though . will try again . 
roast pork v . pulled pork . that was the big decision for me one snowy saturday at dinic ' s . of all the kiosks at reading terminal , the line for dinic ' s snaked longer than any other . but the line went fast ( maybe N minutes ) and impulsively i chose the roast pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe . before taking a bite , i noticed that the sandwich seemed to have been dunked in pork jus . now i generally don ' t like sandwiches that are dunked in jus b c it makes the bread soggy and the sandwich sloppy . but here , the bread held up to the pork juices and still maintained texture . the combination of the roast pork ( sliced like roast beef ) , sharp provolone , greens , and the bread was a wet , juicy , dripping good time . it tasted a lot cleaner and not as oily as i expected , probably due to the rabe , but the porkiness of the meat did get lost in the more powerful flavors of cheese and garlic from the rabe . i then looked over at my friend ' s pulled pork sandwich with provolone and hot peppers , and sneaked a couple bites . here , the pork definitely came through . i had expected chunks of pork in a sweet bbq sauce but i got moist , porky , flavorful , and savory . it exceeded all my expectations . combined with the cheese and peppers , the porkiness still came through . in the age-old debate of roast pork v . pulled pork , my nod goes to the pulled pork . 
in a word authentic ! my wonderful greek uncle ( rest his soul ) would have been delighted to know that such a place existed in essex county , nj . . . the warm , welcoming atmosphere , pleasant , professional staff and last , but certainly not least , tasty , genuine and well thought out mediterranean fare surprised and satisfied my fianc and i . . . the appetizers were generous and delicious , especially the greek artisan sausage , which was probably the best i ' ve ever tasted . the broiled lamb chops came out perfectly juicy , despite the fact that we ordered them medium . for dessert , which i usually pass on , we were kindly offered a complimentary baklava cheescake , creamy , moist , delicious ! the staff made us feel like we were truly guests in their home , and the charm that this culture is known for was well evident and made for a wonderful meal . opa ! ! ! 
been there twice and both times food and service was excellent . pleasant waiters , delicious , simple food and resonable prices , cozy place , good for a date . we got grilled calamari , arugula salad and combination platter - plenty for two . 
the best mexican restaurant in the area . don ' t miss the carnitas de lechon tacos , the sweet plantains , or the guacamole . 
this is a fabulous tunisian restaurant in williamsburg brooklyn . whith incredible dishes and sandwiches . a great suggestion was the " la goulette special falafel sandwich " with hand cut fries seasoned with parmesaan cheese inaide the warm pita . to wash it all down try a natural juice . the service is amazing , you feel at home and always want to comeback to try a new plate . muy bueno ) i loved ) brasileiros que gostam de falafel ou pita vale a pena exprimentar . fica a dica ) 
after all of the hype shake shack has been getting the last couple months i ' ve been wanting to try it and finally did . i got a single shackburger , cheese fries , and a black and white milkshake . the tomato and lettuce was fresh and a good size , but i was disappointed in the size of the single patty . the meat was good and i love that it ' s all-natural , it just wasn ' t enough especially for almost N . next time i ' ll definitely have to get the double . the shacksauce on the burger was incredible and definitely makes the burger . the cheese fries were also delicious , but my favorite part of the meal was the milkshake . the black and white milkshake was so good and the perfect thickness . they were running a promotion for charity where if you donated N , you got a free milkshake on your next visit . i went back the next week to try the peanut butter ! 
i ' ve lived on staten island my whole life i ' ve driven past this place a ton of times my friends have been here so i ' ve decided to make a late night dinner date with my friends we arrive at the place around N N pm we get an awesome waitress by the name of gabby she ' s funny attentive very sweet and easy going and most importantly provided great customer service ! i was happy to have her because for me a bad waitress kills my whole mood when i ' m out but again gabby was incredible . i loved the food ! i ordered a drink called flower bomb which was lovely my only qualm i had was how long we waited for our food and the fact that we kinda felt a little rushed toward closing time or table was being cleaned off before we said we were done however they made up for this mishap by replacing a few things that were thrown out before we were finished . . overall i will be back to eat here i loved it i love the atmosphere i loved the set up of this quaint little eatery ! 
im a breakfast lover and don ' t live far from sabrinas . i would gladly eat here any time . 
so good ! sit at the bar if N or N . ask for recommendations . they have fish you have never heard of . they are all good ! love the green tea iced tea ! just love ! 
i loved the market . i took my daughter and girlfriend for the afternoon . we shopped and eat lunch . we listened to the piano player , ate lunch , bought fresh vegetables and had lunch at carmens fih . the day was great . the place is really cool to walk around for a couple hours . it has everything from wine to spices , fresh produce to gourmet lunch establishments . we had an awesome lunch of cheesesteaks and hoagies at carmen ' s in the market ! ! ! ! 
got the curry shrimp and it was way more than i could eat but none the less the food was great . i recommend for someone who wants a drink and some good caribbean food
after hearing great things about this place from alice l . for literally years now , we decided to stay local for lunch and check out wafa ' s . as i browsed the menu there were many appetizers and lebanese dishes i want to try . the staff here were friendly , knowledgeable , and steered us in the right direction . we had the falafel , lamb shawerma sandwich , kibbe platter , and N beer . everything was delicious and the dishes were all carefully prepared . the falafel were hot and went perfectly hand in hand with the tahini and spicy chili sauces . our favorites were the okra and lamb shawerma sandwich . you can ' t go wrong here ordering some authentic food washing them down with a refreshing local lebanese beer . i don ' t know anywhere else in queens that serves great shawerma like wafa ' s . i wish saved room for dessert . that means i ' ll have to come back again soon to try their baklava and kanafeh . enjoy . p . s . they have byob wednesdays which means there ' s no corkage fees when you bring your own wine . 
this was once a good place to go for a burger and a beer but for the last few visits i have left disappointed . i am not one to wait over N minutes for a bottled beer and over an hour for a burger . the taste of the food has like the service declined . weird flavors that don ' t meld well and blah tastes have made me decide that i need to find another pub to frequent . 
i absolutely love this place . they have amazing salads , soups , sandwiches , pastries and drinks . their pecan sticky buns and lavender lemonade are both to die for . to be honest , i have never had anything here that i didn ' t love or at the very least like . the ingredients are all local fresh it really shows ! the staff are all incredibly helpful friendly too so you can ' t go wrong ! 
love , love , love parc ! it has a great french romantic , laid back open air atmosphere that is good for groups or couples or friends . my best friend and i visit whenever we are in town to catch up and have a wonderful meal together . we used to live in nyc and it reminds me of pastis ( but bigger ) or an upscale french roast . the restaurant itself is huge but reservations are a must because it can get crowded . i like the croque monsieur . the trout was out of this world as well . they also give you a nice basket of french breads . you can ' t go wrong here - it ' s a whole experience ! 
completely thrown by how bad a place with N stars was . . i had to . we just had pasta , beef sliders , and tiramisu . . all were bad . 
imocha is the epitome of fresh tasty food . the best in thai around ! the dumplings and glass noodles are our favorite
nasty breaskfast that taste right out a box . homefries nasty - shredded potatoes that were desert dry eggs okay with cheddar cheese melted on top until i found a long gray hair turkey bacon good - it ' s louis rich brand they grilled up on the foreman grill or something of it ' s kind wheat toast best thing i had on the plate with butter and jelly cranberry juice ocean spray - i saw the bottle service sucked ! no smile or face to face greeting from hostess waitress acted as if she was doing me a favor . damn , i should have gone to ihop right next door , but it was crowded - i see why ! ! ! 
went here on a friday . in scenary and ambiance- a great ny hotspot . typical people-watching , atmosphere , typical expensive cocktails , typical busy-ness ! it ' s wise to make reservations well in advance to snag a table , but sitting at the bar is just fine- as long as you ' re aggressive enough to pounce on the next empty seat . the restaurant has conveniently decided to ignore seating people at the bar , so you ' re on your own- so beware . though i ate at the bar , i ' d recommend making a reservation for table so you can experience the rustic decor , dim candlelights and shield yourself from the cold ! this place is actually much bigger than tia pol ( my other tapas lover ) , and is quite the date spot with his homey , cozy feel . alright what to order . the menu here is really eclectic i think for tapas , finding not the typical spanish fare ( i didn ' t seen an ounce of chorizo , which admittedly was disappointing , at least when i went- and no patatas bravas ! ) - pulling from mainly a lot of south american ( cornish hen ) , italian ( crab cake risotto ) , and greek ( fried goat cheese ? well i guess that could be spanish ) influences . below is a list of what we had and there were worth every mouthwatering bite ! N . people have raved about this and it ' s true- the brussel sprouts are one of the best things i ever tasted ( and you know that the sprouts are not well known for their good taste ) - the pistachio undertones is the real treat here . i even maybe considered a second order- wowee . N . the fried goat cheese- not oily ! you ' d never be able to tell it was in the deep fryer they ' re so clean cut and refreshing . ( yes fried cheese-refreshing ! ) especially dipped in honey ) N . the cornish hen- overlooked as tapas item , and it was good . the meat was very tender , not gamey at all . however , i ' d say the winner was the chili dipping sauce soaked within the hen . beware , though this dish is spicy . ( which for me , is usually no problem and i thought it was hot ) - as it ' s sort of laced with jalapenos . N . the crab cake risotto- passable good , very rich but the lumps of crab were meager and it tasted more soupy than like risotto . N . the charred baby octopus- this was off the hook ! i love me a good octopus , very italian style , perfectly seasoned with aioli on the side and spicy potatoes . yum yum yum N . the squid ink paella- the rice has squid ink in it ! not unusual for tapas but had never seen this infused in rice . and the rice was totally non mushy , it was a bit crunchy ! the other seafood was typical- clams , mussels , shrimps- i didn ' t care for those . i really liked the rice though . the bill came to about N , a little on the higher side but i thought it well worth it . i ' d say for sure do your reading of your ( yelp ! ) reviews because when i asked the waiter what to get , he recommended everything most expensive on the menu . only an unsuspecting tourist would fall for that ! ! 
i was excited when i bumped into this pho restaurant , but my disappointment came when they ignored my presence . it was obviose they did not want to take my order as they continually passed my table serving others . if i was vietnamese , would it had been different ? 
first i want to say . . the place is so cute . they have indoor outdoor seating , the inside is really nice and comfortable . i had high hopes . we went for mother ' s day , the host was very pleasant , and handed me a rose . nice . there ' s the one star for that . we sit down and it takes a really long time for anyone to come over to take our drink order . by the time the waiter does , we are ready to order our meals . as soon as we are done ordering , a waitress comes over and ask us if we are ready to order . disorganized , but , i can look past that . i will say again , i really wanted to like this place . our food comes . my husband gets a french toast burger , which was a little pricey , not much to it , and he said it was just okay . i get the french toast which was pretty yummy . . . and i ordered my N year old daughter pancakes . as i begin to cut her pancakes , i flip one over and notice a hair in the pancakes . sigh . i tell the waiter , who says , " oh yes i see that . . . " and takes the plate away . my daughter proceeds to cry . . . . which was not fun for a mommy on mother ' s day . hey , she wanted her pancakes ! anyway , it takes a good N minutes or so for a new plate to be made . they are pancakes , come on ! and when the waitress returns , she says to us , " well it wasn ' t my hair ! " we did not receive an apology from anyone . and we were also charged for the pancakes . . . i think since it was their mistake , and they upset my daughter , they could have done something for us . or at least an apology . will not be returning - ( 
this is a regular hyped up ramen joint that ppl have been raving on yelp . looks like they restaurant wants to concentrate on flashy , modern decor and yet try to mix up some ramen for its main dish ( thought i was walking into a club to eat some ramen ) . players be warned , the wait is as bad as all hyped up ramen joints in nyc ( N hr wait for me ) . ordered the pork buns and the spicy ramen with some appetizers . the taste is decent and loved the screaming waitresses welcoming you however , white dudes making japense ramen ? ? ? ( look to the kitchen . . . all caucasian ? ) it ' s like chinese people making mexican dishes . just sayin is it worth the wait ? well only reason why i waited was b c of all the hype but , i ' m pretty confident i can find a place that focus ' on its food rather than its decor for a night out on the town . come on , arent ramen , yakitori , chinese places supposed to be located in a small shack-like hole in the walls ? will i return ? prolly not worth the wait and the food wasn ' t worth for a encore visit but , i can say to ya ' ll i ' ve tried it . 
the food was good but my group had the worst service of any restaurant i have ever been to . we had a reservation at N and weren ' t seated until N N . every group that night waited at least N minutes to an hour after their reservation . we had water spilled on a member of our group more than once with no apology . the staff dropped dirty knives on a member of our group again without acknowledgement . they actually handed a ticket to a member of our group on her way to the bathroom and asked her to take it into the kitchen . when she said " are you kidding me " they responded by saying " no it ' s right through there , just say ' order up ' " . not worth the food for the experience . go somewhere else ! ! ! ! 
such a disappointment ! we had skipped this restaurant for the past two years because the menu and service had gone down hill . decided to give them another chance after that much time . best suggestion . . . cross mccrossen ' s off your list ! our server nick was either inexperienced or very overwhelmed . . . i ordered a glass of wine , he returned to take our order . . . oops forgot the wine . . . came back a few minutes later because he forgot what kind of wine i ordered . the list continues . . . whipped ricotta appetizer may have been good but i asked for a side plate and salt , salt arrived but no side plate ! ok we can eat the appetizer w o a side plate . . . and here comes our dinner served on a two top table jammed alongside the appetizer that we didn ' t get to enjoy . i bussed my own table to make room for our meal . i could carry on but there are too many topics to name , like no response when my husband asked about the missing chorizo in his entree , or the incorrect bill that came out higher than presented without a word of explanation from anyone . it ' s a shame this was a neighborhood gem years ago , my recommendation walk a few blocks further to fairmont , plenty of great restaurants up there . 
good cheap food
my neighbor told me about this place . the calzone is delicious , the wings are awesome and everything else is never a disappointment . we order from here at least once a week and the prices are just right . highly recommended . 
talking about real authentic thai food , it has to be here . papaya salad is one of my favorite dish here . nothing fancy about decoration . the restaurant looks really plain but the taste of their foods make a different ! 
went here for a weekday lunch with a friend , while in town on a business trip . i expect things in manhattan to be overpriced , so i was pleasantly surprised by the affordable lunch combos and the quality of the food ( very good pad thai , plus an appetizer included in the price ) . service was polite and fast ( not too surprising , since the place was almost empty ) . i ' d go again . 
the other day , my finicky friends and i traipsed about the east village , in search of a place that would satisfy my more adventurous palate and placate their traditional tastes . we weren ' t looking to get all boozy but figured a couple beers might be nice . it was freezing , and when h suggested thai , my first thought was , shrug . i ' ve had my share of pad thai and basil stir-fry . it ' s usually decent in the area , but nothing worth writing home about . we walked past ngam twice before realizing that , due to its name , it may very well be thai . i braced myself for a predictably just-ok meal as we entered the narrow foyer . the interior is beautiful . it looks like something out of williamsburg , dare i say it--an almost farm-to-table atmosphere with red brick decor and slightly kitschy neon lighting . from what i saw , the staff is small , with the kitchen exposed to incoming patrons . ngam ' s decor straddles the line between comforting hole-in-wall and furtively upscale joint , with convivial paintings and candlelit messages . there ' s a communal table that reminds me of that joke about the people in heaven feeding each other with their super long spoons while the people in hell starve ( i ' m not religious ) . we started out the meal with spring rolls . they ' re pretty good . the stand out quality is definitely their size . to be honest , spring rolls aren ' t really my thing , but i must say , the price is right for the size . these are not your chinatown one-finger girth spring rolls they ' re crispy , flaky trunks , two abreast , two rows , in a tangy sauce . i actually didn ' t finish mine because the rest of the menu excited me so much . let me start with the obvious my two friends , being the boring people they are , ordered pad thai . i like pad thai just as well as the next but i was all , whatever . however , since their food came out a minute or two before mine , i decided to sample each dish . one was shrimp and the other , chicken . the sauce had this impeccable texture , not too thick , and not too oily , that imparted flavor without overwhelming the consistency of the dish . the chicken was fresh and good , but the shrimp was amazing . ngam is not stingy about their meat or their portions . i got the cinderella pumpkin curry . it is . amazing . not for the spice-shy or those who cringe at curry overload , because it ' s spicy , and packed with curry and peppers . the base is coconut milk , and the pieces of pumpkin add just enough eclectic flavor to make it not your average red curry . i was a bit afraid of the idea of pumpkin in curry , to be totally honest , but i went for it , and i ' m glad i did . i wasn ' t sure about which meat to add ( they give you options ) so i just got it veggie . next time i will try shrimp . i will try beef . i will try everything . we sat there , sated and steeped in goodness , for a solid N minutes . we sipped our beers . to be totally frank , the beers seemed a bit pricey ( i think you can get singha for more like N at most thai places in the area ) but you ' re paying for the overall experience . if you want mediocre pad thai that ' s a gamble at N and a few cheap rounds , go ahead and hedge your bets on any ol ' thai place . if you want an interesting meal , a menu that has options for even your pickiest , most vegan , most gluten-free , soy-allergic , lactose-intolerant pals , give ngam a try . the service was also thoughtful and attentive . i will be back . 
horrible would be to kind a word for the food at this place . i just woke up at N in the morning because the regurgitation of their sauce from the mussels and chicken parm hero almost made me throw up in my sleep . i ' ll get to my review now . i had the chicken parm hero and an order of mussels . first the chicken parm hero ' s bread was spongy , even after being heated in the oven there was no crunch at all . its almost like there using old bread . old bread still doesnt crunch when heated . their sauce for the chicken parm hero was non existent and was watered down to the max . the inside of my bread looked like a wet tampon of a woman almost done with her period . very little sauce and what was on there was watered down with no flavor . as for the cheese , it doesnt exist . dont bother looking foir it . i dont know how places like this stay in business . the chicken was overcooked to the consistency of old shoe leather . on to the mussels now . the sauce for the mussels is horrible . it is watered down , barely there and it looks like they take can of cheap tomato paste and plop a little on top . no fresh garlic in their sauce . i tasted what seemed to be garlic but it was tastless so maybe it was something else in that sauce . or maybe it was bottled prepared garlic . the mussels themselves are horrible . i will be throwing out the rest of the mussels , i forced myself to eat about N pieces because i felt bad about all the money i was throwing away . that was a bad decision as i sit up writing this at Nam to warn others of this dive of a retaurant . people have no taste in bayonne to have kept this dump open for so many years . you would think teenagers at burger king cooked my food thats how horrible the food is here . i will never order from here again and delete this number from my phone and never look back . totally ridiculous and for the price i paid a real sin too ! i lost my email so i had to open a new yelp account . this isnt my first review here on yelp and i have no ax to grind with this restaurant , it is an unbiased review . this wasnt the only time i experienced this from their food . their chicken parm hero is always bad this way . this was the last time , the horror which is their food wasnt a one time thing its a common occurence . 
love this place . . . had the tasting menu a few weeks ago . . . . out of this world . only negative comment would be the vegetarian option was basically the same as the regular option sans meat . . . . didnt work well to share for two . service was out of this world . ) ) ) ) ) 
this is a really really great place , you dont get the same amount of meat you use to get when they first started the brunch but the portions are still good , and i mean how amazing are those yucca bread pieces ? the services is starting to slow down a bit , the male waiters arent as friendly as the female waitresses and i hate having to ask for items that other tables are getting , but even with that this place is still great . . . it might have something to do with the sangria . . . reservations are even starting to become difficult to come by - im thinking of going with N start so people stay away . . . oh and the music they play during your meal in the background is really really good too , i wish they would to like a cuba libre thing and clear the tables and have a dance floor . . . but seriously people . . you should think about not gong there . . . since you know its so awesome . . . 
stay away ! ! ! ! i live in north lawrence and this could b such a nice place if they had a clue how to run a restaurant . . . . the food is awful , service awful . . . and the N son who runs the bar could care less if u want a drink because he ' s busy texting on his phone all nite . . . what a disappointment because they have a great location and if they cared a little they could make the place respectable . . . try metro in ewing or the firkin tavern , acacia on N , wildflowers at rt N circle . . . . all have better food , service , and atmosphere ! ! ! 
we got sips and bites to cater an event recently , and the food was an instant hit . the price was right and everyone at the party loved the food . we will definitely be using them more in the future , its nice to know that there are quality independently owned caterers out there that dont charge a million bucks . 
it ' s super hard to find good takeout chinese food in philadelphia . like , the kind you can order on grubhub at N N pm for less than N ! golden empress consistently impresses me . the lo mein is top notch . every time . my boyfriend and i both agree - it ' s just excellent . vegetarian crab rangoon - delicious . i ' ve had a mix of entrees , and some are so-so , some are great . chicken with cashews - not so great . tofu with chinese bbq sauce - awesome ! another plus ? the menu is so large ! and golden empress comes in handy with my vegetarian vegan friends , as half of the menu is for veggie lovers . i only order takeout from golden empress now . 
never had the food but the bubble tea is fantastic . 
we read about five leaves while on the west coast , and sought it out on our visit to brooklyn . we arrived on a warm thursday evening around six pm . the outside tables were all filled but there was plenty of room inside . they played some cool background music ( the youngbloods , jazz , etc ) . as our meal progressed , the place began to fill up , and by the time we left it was a packed party vibe . so , if you like a quieter ambiance , come early ! the service was attentive throughout , though more personal before it got so crowded . while not inexpensive , our food was excellent . we ordered a grilled fish called dorade , which was succulent and tasty . another dish consisting of saut ed ricotta cheese , was also delicious . the truffle fries were fine , though not necessarily " to die for " as some other reviewers have contended . the server recommended a riesling wine , which was just right for us . we had to ask for bread , but once we did it was soft , yet crispy and tasty . the chocolate pecan tart was a wonderful finish to our meal . a minor complaint was that we ordered an ice tea and twice asked for refills . we were unaware we ' d be charged for three teas . i would add a fifth star if you don ' t mind a crowded party scene as the evening progresses , or if you arrive around N pm for dinner while it ' s still calm and peaceful . 
the matre di makes you feel like you are welcome and valued , treats the patrons as valued guests . the meals are great . for those who want non-gluten or whole wheat , they provide this which few do , which is welcome for those of us who are watching our simple carbs . the salmon was superb . 
i tried , really , i did . . . salads are not fresh , burgers have no taste , and after each attempt , ended up wandering home feeling rather ill . its in a great location , and having a beer outside is fine , and the staff is very nice and attentive , but the food is so not fine . . . 
i absolutely adore this place . shabby chic and so my style . located inside the abc plaza , the decor is stunning . white tables , white chairs , chandeliers everywhere , and even custom made plates . a girly girl ' s dream . the food matched the greatness of the decor . the crab toast ( so good and very meaty ) , organic fried chicken ( full of flavor and so moist ) , black sea bass ( very citrusy ) , and mashed potatoes ( light and fluffy ) were all amazing . if this place is this good , i can ' t even begin to imagine how insane the original jean george restaurant is . . . 
this is a decent spot . the decor is great ! i really liked the cocktails . the bartenders were very friendly and knew how to pour a good one . the food was mostly good . the guacamole was below average in my opinion . it was way too watery and somewhat bland . i enjoyed the tlayuda con chapulines ( grasshoppers on a tortilla ) . the chapulines were nice and spicy but the tortilla was too thick . too thick tortilla is a common theme here . the duck dumplings was good . the mole sauce was the winer of that dish . i could have drank the sauce . definitely worth a visit but i probably will not be back anytime soon . 
great beer selection from around the country . my kind of spot . i love going places that have a beer menu with a wide variety - and a menu that provides a description and rating of the various beers on tap . i think they have about N or so beers on tap . went here with a group of N and had several of the food items as well . food was ok - nothing special - but good . one item that we did really like was the mushroom sliders - they were excellent ! good spot in midtown - close to times square . lots of tvs with sports on . 
meant to be a nyc classic , i unfortunately did not think this was the finest example of nyc ' s best pizza to an out-of-towner . the pizza was good , solid really , but not outstanding . it did the trick , and will impress anyone who is from asia ( where good pizza is extremely rare , if non-existent ) , but the ingredients don ' t exactly sing and the crust is a bit too thick for my personal tastes . also had a calzone - that was very very filling . the wine is honestly miserable here - and if you want a passable wine , try the montepulciano d ' abbruzzo . it ' s a cash only spot , and the d cor is quickly fading , and feeling old and sad . 
went to tavola with a friend and knew right away it would be great . such an old school restaurant with no frills just about great food . had the parpardelle and my friend had the lasagna , both amazing . reasonable prices too . highly recommended
as someone who lived in bologna for a year- i was thrilled to find a piece of bologna " la grassa " here in nyc . yum yum yum . pricey , but i can ' t get any closer to bo than this place ( unless i ' m eating a piadina at piada ! ) 
when i was in nyc for a week in november a friend said don ' t forget to look for halal guys and try it . i didn ' t pay much mind to it at first until i got to our hotel on avenue of the americas and Nrd street and saw them on the next block . on my Nrd night i woke up hungry at around N Nam and was thinking of where to get food , then i remembered halal guys so i went down from my room on the Nst floor and braved the N degree cold weather to line up and try this food stand with all the hype behind it . i got the chicken plate and took it back to my room . this meal put a smile of satisfaction to my belly indeed ! ! i can see why people line up to eat their food . for N you get a big plate of rice and shredded meat on top and some pita bread . i do not know when i will be back in ny but when i do i will definitely look for halal guys again ! one of the best street food around ! 
went there twice in one week , when it first opened , it was that good . now it ' s on my list of regulars . the space is really cozy and very casual . the bar is so close to the sidewalk you can call it alfresco . i like the decor and the feel of the place . the place does get hot in the summer , but the food is so worth it , even on a N degree day . beet salad every time it ' s fresh , all the ingredients are in harmony , actual candied walnuts ! i love beets so i may be biased , but i order this every time . goulash tastes so homemade it ' s not even funny . again such fresh ingredients , it ' s not some cooked down mush that has been sitting there all day . the carrots are soft but still identifiable , the beef is soft but not preserved tasting , the pita served on the side soft on the inside , crunchy on the outside . burger sinfully delicious ! the dough is like a pastry puff meet pita pocket functioning as a bun . . . first time i saw a burger like this . the melted cheese makes the meat so juicy and savory . messy to eat , but worth the treadmill time next day . beef tongue taco solid . not a fan of what looks like guacamole out of a squeeze bottle , but overall tastes good . the pita is so fresh , unfortunately it falls apart when you pick it up , but it still tastes good . 
haven ' t visited this place in a couple years but i ' m glad i came back . the food was really good . the soup was a little bland but the small plate appetizers were excellent ( eggplant , shrimp and cauliflower choices ) . the salads were also really nice - light , fresh and flavorful . our waiter , mustafa , did an excellent job ! thank you . 
few days ago my friend and i decided to find something new , something interesting . the eddy was the place that we have choosen . and we didn ' t regret ! situated in the east village , having just a couple handfuls of tables , with lovely decor . food and drinks were unexpectedly tasty . that ' s what we were looking for ! 
i been to soco several times and i always have a good time . i had tried multiple things on the menus from appetizers to entrees it ' s all delicious and very tasty . the drinks are also good
i wouldn ' t order here ever again ! i called in to ask about delivery to my area the night before because i knew that the following day i would be having guests over and i heard the food here was decent so i figured i ' d try it out . the next evening when i called i felt like i had to practically beg the lady to take my order after she told me the prior evening they did deliver to my area . after she agreed to take my order she started rushing me through my order and , not knowing that i understand portuguese , started cursing to another person that i didn ' t want my picadinho with pork ! after i finished my order and i told her i was paying with my credit card she said " i ' m wasting my time we don ' t take cards for delivery orders " and hung up on me ! ! my advice to anyone wanting to eat here , before you spend the N required for delivery then a N delivery fee on top of that save yourself the headache and order some valenca the foods great and they are really nice . 
awesome restaurant . i came here with friends and we ate enough food to feed a small country and put me into a coma . i ate so much i almost died . but , i just had to eat it . if you go here , you ' ll understand . they divide the menu into " small " and " big " which somewhat matches starters and entrees - however the smalls could pass for a meal for one person , and the bigs can easily be shared by two people . in my opinion , the smalls are also better . they have something called " dublin dr . pepper " and if you ' re a fan of dr . pepper you will love it . also , get the cornbread . don ' t question me on this . it is prepared and served in a cast iron pan , with butter and honey . i didn ' t get or try the salad wedge , but my friends did and it looked real good . also , order the mac cheese . this is not an option ! i don ' t care what meat carb fun-free diet or plan you think you ' re on . it has bacon bits in it . like i said , i almost died . i ' m still working on the bigs . some friends had the roast half chicken , which looked good , but not quite my style ( a lot of white meat ) . i had the country fried steak . let me reiterate that it should be shared . fried steak is not exactly an idea that makes my mouth water , but i ate all of it by myself , so it must have been pretty good as far as that goes . it came with mashed potatoes ( good ) and cabbage with bacon ( not crazy about the greens , but the bacon helped ) . i washed that down with a chocolate bread pudding dessert , which was also meant for two people to share . i guess it was just one of those days . i planned to take half of it home for later , but i got bored and just kept picking at it until it was all gone . oh yeah - it was good . i ' ll add that the restaurant also has a really nice , chill atmosphere , a great place to come with a big group or with a date , or better yet a double-date . the waiters are super friendly , too . a home run . 
i ' ve been eating here for years and i can never come back to philly without eating a max ' s giant cheese steak . 
they charged me N dollars for one noodle dish . it was a good dish , tasted great , but definitely not worth N dollars ! ! ! 
salads ! salads ! salads ! temple grill has the best salads in town build your own with the freshest ingredients ! great , friendly , attentive service and believe or not , a very good wine selection . yum all around ! 
went for a romantic dinner saturday night and was horribly disappointed . we were put next to a rowdy , drunk table who ruined the dinner of all nearby diners , oblivious to management . there appeared to be N managers , but they just hung out in front of the kitchen all night , and in ear shot of this table , but did nothing . i order the calamari app . and when i received it it was completely different from the description in the menu . i asked the waitress and she said they were N calamaris , and that i should have been specific . i told her i wasn ' t aware of that , but i wanted the other , she brought it and charged for both ! my husband ' s N fish was burnt . it took N minutes to get the check . the entire time we could not have a conversation because of the obnoxious table next to us . horrible experience ! don ' t go ! 
i do not like like this unpretentious looking place so full of . . . pretentions . i do not like to leave a restaurant hungry after spending N for two . i do not like the owner ' s fake smile and " abraham the pit bull " . but i really wanted to like it . so close from home . we went three times . why ? food can be good and after the first time i wanted to believe that the chef was running out of ingredients as how to explain the ridiculous size of my entree . second time abraham was suffering from a " hate you all " attack and the owner was looking miserable with her " minimi " hanging on her belly ( good , at least the baby seems really well fed ) but at our table , portion size did not increase . third time the wait was so long that we finally found the courage to take the car to go somewhere else even if that would take us Nmin to find a spot on the way back home ( park slope can be bad , yes ) sometimes it is better to tell a customer the true about the wait " i apologize but i don ' t think i will have anything before an hour " . instead of assessing a N min wait and expecting someone to wait an hour . . . because not only that customer may not wait but there is a good chance he won ' t ever come back . 
if you are more focused are being spotted at a trendy soho restaurant or in the mood to people watch , go to balthazar . otherwise , save your money and go somewhere else for better french food ( i . e . la sirene ) . 
went to rogues for a friend ' s birthday . . . the place was amazing . great laid back atmosphere and unbelievable food . the mac and cheese was hands down some of the best mac and cheese that i have ever had . great place to hang with friends , drink , and eat . i highly recommend you checking out this little gem in philly ! love it there ! ! 
this place was alright . it ' s too trendy for me though . i ' m more a simple girl with a love for good quality food , regardless of price . i enjoyed the bottles of seltzer and distilled water though . i always feel bad for asking the waiters to get me more water lol . waiters here were really nice and friendly even though the place was so packed . the complimentary bread was hard to chew , seemed like it was old . the " hot chips " was just regular potato chips with some cheese and it was N i dont think it was that much worth it . the gnocchi was very doughy and not silky smooth . there was a bit of a char on each piece that made it more chewy . i really loved the truffle cream sauce though . i would have liked it if the gnocchi was better . it was an okay experience , but i don ' t think i ' m going to come back anytime soon ? 
pasta the way it should be . simple , fresh and flavorful without drowning in sauce . quality ingredients and the pasta is always cooked perfectly ! i have never had a bad meal here . . ever . even when i have gone outside my comfort zone and decided to try something i wasn ' t sure about i am always pleasantly surprised . they always satisfy me . the staff is friendly and efficient but saying the space is small is an understatement . however , the food is so good i don ' t care . one of the very few places where i will wait to get a table . all food is made to order and the kitchen is open to your view . if you are reading this and thinking about trying capri cafe . . . . . go ! ! ! ! you ' ll be happy you did . 
didn ' t have a set meal , went off course and grabbed the fried fish , the sweet sausage , the home fries type sweet potatoes , and the bread . all tasty . 
have been numerous times . in my mind the best middle eastern restaurant in the city . food is fantastic , an a i have yet to try everything ( pretty close though ) , but so far each dish has been a home run , which is rare for me , as i ' m a picky eater . ilili has more of a communal feel when it comes to their dishes , they are a foodie place , so everyone at the table orders a few things and passes around , which works out very well because the abundance of variety in taste should be taken advantage of . the staff is top notch , service is excellent . if it ' s your first time , check out any of their lamb dishes . the mixed grill is excellent as well . don ' t forget to order the baba ghannouj , it comes with an unlimited supply of fresh pita , one of their staples . everyone has , at one point or another , eaten baba ghannouj , but nothing close to the way ilili prepares theirs ! really the perfect place to try new things and reach out of your food comfort zone . you will not be disappointed ! 
tapas bar in nyc . met family for lunch in union square . cruised in without a reservation . what luck . very sustainable . we shared small plates . each was a visual as well as a taste treat . we did the deviled eggs , pig ears , chorizo meatballs , patatas bravas . nice job guys ! 
this is a hole in the wall where i would expect to see anthony bourdain or some other food adventurer . this ramen mecca definitely gets packed , but is certainly worth the wait . the noodles are tasty , the pork is tender , and it just simply cozy and warming after a day around the city . . . worth a trip , and perhaps a wait . but totally worth it . note cash only
loved this place , although it is probably one of the most cramped seating arrangement ever . get the grilled octopus , fantastic , along with the warm pitas , with hummus . the wait is long , but there is a nice bar across the street you can wait in , and the hostess will come and get you . miss this place a lot
i have been twice and was happy to get something other than portuguese food in the ironbound district . the drinks were ok but nothing to write home about . the service was " eh " . the first time i went the waitress was a little incompetent but nice . i ordered the salmon and shrimp rolls which were good , took a little long for just sushi though . the second time i waited ten minutes at the bar and there was only one other person besides myself so i ended up leaving and going to iberia ' s . too many spots in iron bound for bad service . 
came here on whim with a colleague for a " quick " business lunch ( we left N hours later ! ) . what we got was a true gem of an establishment in queens . the menu boasted some of the finest italian haute cuisine with a staff that made the entire experience as inviting as dinner at grandma ' s . i had the chilean seabass and my colleague had the ostrich filets . . . . appetizers were razor clams and carpaccio . amazing food equisite service total winner . 
after a second visit to stone park cafe , my opinion of the place has improved and i ' ve upgraded my original rating of N to N stars . the food here is solid ( case in point i ordered the roasted chicken and it was cooked perfectly - even the breast was flavorful , tender , and moist . . . . and this dish is probably the most likely to be overdone and dry ) . the atmosphere is welcoming and upbeat - lots of warm wood , sunlight , and happy music . plus - peach bellinis for brunch . yum ! 
great ribs and rice , fries were great too . tasty hot true bbq . great employees . 
love this place . not a visit to nyc goes by without at least one visit to this small cafe . situated on a very quaint bit of nolita , cafe gitane never fails to satiate my need for strong coffee , delicious french moroccan dishes and good people watching . i ' m hopelessly addicted to the avocado on seven grain toast . for breakfast , you can ' t go wrong with the baked eggs ( either salmon or tomatoes basil ) . 
i would like to thank turanos pizzeria for motivating me to open , sign up and begin writing yelps about restaurants i eat at . my experience at turanos was that terrible . i should ' ve known it be terrible when i found their coupon in my friends trash can . first of all after making the phone call , i received a call back because they had forgotten half my order . second i was going to write a yelp right away but i realized i only received my " breadsticks " and my coke . no one gets delivery on just " breadsticks " . i thought " hmm , maybe this guy can ' t carry a paper bag and a coke and a pizza box , he ' ll be back . " nope . sure enough- he left when i chased him down the street he told me he forgot the pizza . so while i wait for the pizza , let me describe the " breadsticks " to you . imagine a ladyfinger cookie dipped in water . . . . but instead of water it looked like it was drenched in sweat . garlicky sweat . the coca-cola was decent . best part of the delivery . so i finally get my pizza - N minutes later . same cold pizza . no effort in giving me a fresh pie . i open it because hey i ' m starving . and i sure as hell was not going to eat the " breadsticks " . so the pizza was cooked in the same sweat as the breadsticks . disgusting . i think a lunchables pizza has more love into it . i had to order another pizza to avoid the trauma of turanos pizzeria ! avoid this pizzeria at all cost unless you want bad food . boycott turanos ! shame , shame , shame . 
been here twice . once for dinner and recently for breakfast . the first time was for dinner w c was long time ago , i remember waiting for N mins for a table . i was w a friend and we were both visiting new york and wanted some french food . we decided to come here since it was highly recommended by a friend . i had the fettucine w wild mushrooma and parmesean and a cheese plate that was very good . the service was not as good as the food . our waitress that night wasn ' t very attentive and took a while to get our order w c kinda pissed me off since we waited N mins for a table . . the second time i came was for breakfast . did not wait this time . we were seated right away . i had the french toast and tried my mom ' s scrambled egg in puff pastries . it was both very good . the scrambled egg in puff pastry was really tasty w c was expected because we paid over N breakfast for N people . the service this time was better than the last . it seems like they have an employee for everything . there ' s the guy that refills the coffee , a different person that took our order and a different person that brought our food . . . so many people that served us that it was overwhelming . since i enjoyed the puff pastry , we went to the other side after breakfast to buy some more pastries to take home . this place getsa really packed for breakfast and dinner . reservations highly recommended . 
this place is pretty solid . considerably new to this neighborhood but good . i moved to this area from jersey city where you can grab an authentic meal pretty much anywhere but this restaurant is definitely up there with the best . the employees are very nice and helpful with recommendations . delivery is about average , around N minutes . . . if you want something very simple and quite filling , packed with flavor i would recommend any of the tortas . 
i wasn ' t looking for fake meat , but the buffalo chicken sandwich seemed popular . it was big ( N inches square and about N . N inches thick ) , and pretty tasty . the " chicken " seemed like chicken as long as you didn ' t examine it too closely , and i am sure the spicy sauce helped . it was a bit dripped , so eat over the wrapper . it was pretty good , but not so good that i would automatically get it next time i went there . it is large enough that it will more than likely fill you up . two people with modest appetites could split it , particularly if you get a side to share , too . the green power smoothie was ok . banana and almond butter are the most prevalent flavors . overall , tasty vegetarian food , and i would go there again . 
the pizza here is pretty good . definitely worth trying . everything else is just ok . 
holy mackerel these guys know how to make good pizza ! i ' ve had slices all over nj and this is the real deal . stromboli ' s and calzones are great too . if you ' ve got room danny ' s wife makes some really great flan . ask for it . 
the food is amazing . 
best date spot in the hood . love the skirt steak , i get it every time . good wine selection -- also to note wine half off before seven . deserts pretty kickin too . 
i am greek and visiting from athens , your mama spanakopita i had -and am coming back for more one day after . . -is as good as it gets ! the homemade spanakopita that finally i can find uptown ! please dont compromise your quality of ingredients after few months -its perfect ! 
amazing ! ! ! i love ramen and i love minca . 
blueberry muffins worth the hype . filled with blueberries . coffee not so much . it tasted sour . when i walked in , i nearly fainted . it was stuffy and gross . the smell of food was overwhelming . not the fresh just-out-of the oven bakery smell it was more like the back of someone ' s kitchen who had been cooking all day . entered inhaling a big wiff of that and subsequently lost my appetite . workers were nice and clearly hardworking , but reaching over each other to get their work done . worst part of my experience was a fellow patron , who decided she had the right to cut the line . . . because all she wanted was a free coffee and didn ' t have to pay . it didn ' t seem to occur to her her order still takes time from the staff who could be instead assisting the people who arrived before her . her sense of entitlement was enough to make me think twice before heading back . 
omg talk about yummy ! ! ! ! 
it is with great pleasure that i write this negative review . i ' m no stranger to indian food , and yes , the food here is not bad at all . occasionally i feel i ' m being bribed with oil , and i ' ve only had the vegetarian dishes , but otherwise it ' s worth the price . however , the consistency of the food is greatly exceeded by the consistency of the poor service . two of the three times i ' ve gone , when it looks like we are winding down , i ' ve been asked to leave so that " they can use the table . " it ' s not like i ' m sitting there all hours of the night--in fact , one of those times they hadn ' t even brought me the check to sign yet . any lover of indian food out there will agree that a few moments of sitting after some large portions of spicy food may be necessary . . . i would rather bite the bullet and fork out the extra money at masala grill than eat here again . 
have been waiting with a grumbling stomach for the past year for juliana ' s to open . i went last night for opening night and have to say that the pizza was great . the crust was light , fluffy and salty with just the right amount of char . the sauce was bright and sweet and the cheese was melted to perfection and didn ' t fall off the pizza in chunks like grimaldi ' s does . as someone who lives in dumbo and has waited out the line at grimaldi ' s only to be disappointed by the soggy burnt pizza and rude staff , i couldn ' t be more excited to have patsy back in the neighborhood in front of the oven where he belongs ! 
the meal was fine . had i not had better indian food in philly , it would have gotten N stars . hubby and i shared papdi chaat , lamb korma , and garlic naan . the chaat seemed unusually watery and lacked serious depth of flavor . lamb korma was good , though the lamb could have been softer . naan was not crispy and garlic was undercooked . friendly service . idk , the food just seemed to kinda just . . . exist . the rice wasn ' t floral or anything , and was mushy . i guess it ' s in a good location , and is better than tiffin . but make the travel to the northeast for tastier indian food . won ' t be back to ekta . 
the best chinese in w . hartford although there aren ' t many good places . food is pretty fresh and quick service . good for takeout . like the dancing butterfly . 
i ' ve been to cucina zapata three different times now and each time i come away amazed ! i ' ve had the cap ' n crunch tilapia each time and it has been consistently delicious - well-cooked , enhanced just perfectly with asian slaw and a mayo sauce with a zing ! after reading the reviews on this site , my next choice in the chicken satay taco . well done , cucina zapata . you are a welcome addition to the drexel ' food truck row ' and i will continue to frequent your business . how do they make such amazing food out of a truck ? ? ? and - they are super-friendly to boot . i also caution readers to not wait until late in the day to grab your lunch - you may be disappointed as i have been a few times . 
bad service from the owner . placed my order n didn ' t get everything
best meatballs on the north shore of staten island . and the pizza is consistently hot and delicious too . 
i am so happy to see hong ' s on yelp ! this is the best dumpling within a N mile radius . i have been a customer for so many years . i would say over N maybe even N years . this is my favorite place ever . the sweetest owner ever too . i love her dumplings so much . i will get some next weekend when i am in town . . . . everyone should try these dumplings . . . 
wow has this place gone down hill ! i had eaten here a number of times , but tonight was the kicker . we arrived and were seated at our table , only to wait about N minutes for a waitress to come to our table . we asked the bus boy ( while waiting ) if we could have some peanuts ( because we did not get the rolls the hostess normally gives you when you are seated- got them myself ) . the busboy proceeds to take a bucket of half eaten peanuts ( with broken shells on top ) from another table and plops them on ours . finally the waitress comes , and goes into a N minute shpeel about her life etc . we order drinks , which take another N minutes to come . finally dinner arrives , we ordered N steaks medium rare , they were so rare they could have walked off the table , husband sends it back , only to have the waitress bring it back saying that the cook did not agree that it was rare , it must be the lighting ? really . ? we ate what we could and ran out of there . bottom line- food- o . k . service- bad . lost a customer tonight . 
definitely worth going for the pork belly steamed buns if nothing else . . better to go with a big party to take advantage of the large meals . . Noz ribeye or whole pork butt is too much for N people . . also cool ambience and and good drinks . . . try it out if you ' re in nyc
the food is great , the prices are reasonable . i always call ahead for the wait time , i have never waited more than N minute . i avoid going on weekends during dinner time . it is kind of loud and crowded but the food makes it worth it . 
i came here last night with my boyfriend and it was fantastic ! i had called a couple nights before to try to get reservations before- but they said they were full ! but the hostess also mentioned that they take limited reservations , so there would probably be seating if we just called ahead . we had just been walking around burlington when we decided to grab dinner and there was no wait at all ! the decor is a bit fancy- but casual clothing is welcome ! we had such a nice server ! her name was emily and when i asked her about the couscous on the salmon , she said that if i didn ' t like she could easily grab something else for me ! it was great service ! the food ! it was so yummy ! the salmon was salt and pepper crusted and the couscous came with a red pepper sauce-that i thought was going to be spicy but it was refreshing and cool-delicious ! it was a lovely experience ! will be back again ! 
if you ever wondered what heinz ketchup on soggy dough tastes like get a square from l b . it ' s just nasty . i ' m a native new yorker and i ' d rather eat ellios than eat at l b . 
i just celebrated thanksgiving here and had a beautiful candle lit dinner with a friend . the first thing i noticed was the amazing ambience ! dim lights , white table and wooden table layouts , a packed and fun crowd , and most importantly the smell of french food ! i ordered the steak au poivre which was the ny steak but juicy and tender ! it was a thick cut , medium rare , bold peppery flavor with a sauce that just melts off ! ! it ' s the best french steak i ' ve ever had ! it came with creamy spinach too ! the complimentary bread is amazing too because it ' s a short assortment and my fav is the berry nut bread . i had a glass of corbieres which was a fruity red wine . overall dinner was on point and i enjoyed my stay ! is def come back ! 
one of my favorite spots in town ! 
the food is spectacular . sometimes subtle , sometimes bold- always flavorful . the servers have always been knowledgeable and friendly with my groups . it ' s a little expensive , but worth saving up for . 
i wish i had reviewed vitae earlier , because at this point i have forgotten what i had ordered . i dined at vitae sometime last winter , and truly cannot recall what i ordered . pros great customer service , ample space between tables , an array of fine wines and cocktails , fresh and tasty food ! ! ! ! the food was slowly cooked and was not heavy . cons none ! 
have been here a few times for lunch . its really hard to spot the place ( literally a whole in the wall - in between a bunch of businesses ) . i normally order the cuban sandwich - great price for the size . the reason why i didnt give this place N stars is due to the size of the establishment and the not so clean atmosphere . at least its clean from what i can see behind the counter around the cooking area and food . 
no great cheesesteak can be assembled in less time than it takes to order . it breaks my heart than so many tourists will know little more than pat ' s and similarly inadequate , corner-cutting , canned-attitude sort of establishments . they are open late , which is a plus and they are preferable to geno ' s . but best in philly ? not a bloody chance . 
awesome place- awesome food- awesome staff ! 
i work right around the corner and always visit here for dinner or drinks during the week . great food and waiters ! 
i just moved to burlington and was exploring town , stumbled across this store as they were finishing construction . i talked to the owner and he explained their whole operation , and a few days later it was up and running . unbelievable yogurt ! it was pouring rain all week but this place kept us dry for the couple of rounds we went there for . going to be an after dinner regular for us
we ' ve dined at some really amazing places . my whole family is a bunch of foodies - love good food , and equally important , appreciate great service . auroro soho is a true gem . it looks like a nothing special place right next to subway , but inside is a really cosy restaurant with excellent food . portions just the right size , pasta is excellent and not too heavy , diver scallops with poncetta is to die for . great wine selection and even wine by the glass was delicious . don ' t even get me going about deserts . definitely recommend . 
we had been meaning to come here for a while , and when a daily deal for N for a seven course menu for two cropped up , i jumped right on it . it was the middle of the week , so not very busy , and there seemed to be at least two other tables taking advantage of deals as well . the courses were hit and miss , and all really tiny , as were the cocktails . i mean , i get that a tasting menu isn ' t going to consist of seven entrees , but by the end of it we were hungry enough to order extra rolls . in the end , we dropped another N on top of the voucher ( for two cocktails , two rolls , tax and tip ) , and there ' s absolutely no way our meal was worth the N we paid in total , let alone N . the mochi ice cream was insanely good . i would have been a lot happier with seven courses of that . and the hunt for decent sushi in philly continues . 
with all the great reviews , i was left very disappointed by the food here . the menu is very limited and if you don ' t eat meat or pork , your options are cold antipasti or one or two other options . i ordered the salad with octopus which kind of bland and didn ' t leave much to be desired for another bite . my husband had a pasta which he said was ok and had better at home , which says something cause i ' m no chef in the kitchen . this was our last dinner in the city while visiting and it was a bummer to leave so disappointed . the ambiance is cute and romantic which was one of the best things about the restaurant . our server was very nice too which was a plus . overall will never go back nor recommend it . 
carroll gardens is full of french restaurants , and for a vegetarian , brunch is the only real accommodating meal . of the several cafes available , luluc remains the favorite . i have to admit that i cannot attest to the full menu but i can attest to what i have tried . my routine is to order eggs florentine while my husband orders pancakes . halfway through we spit the meal . it is consistently a great choice . luluc is also the earliest to open on smith street and serves brunch on the weekdays as well as weekends . it is ever reliable when visitors are in town and when cereal at home just wont do . it seems unfair to rate a place based on two items on the menu but i like the ambiance as well , friendly staff and pretty decent coffee ( which may not seem a compliment , but it is ) . 
i like this place . it ' s a pleasant space . we had an early reservation and were seated immediately . the waitress promptly opened our wine and brought us water . she gave an intelligent run-down of the specials . the place is pretty much full by Npm on the weekeend . the potato soup was chef ' s choice for the day and it was good . it went nicely with the bread and garlic oil . at our table we had italian sausage rigatoni and parmesan beef gnocchi . both were quite good . it ' s not the best italian i ' ve had in phila , but it ' s not too far away . between the good food and good service we had , i would go back . the prices are also fair for the portions . the only negative really is that even with reservations , it ' s a bit tricky because the dining room manger just writes names and times on a sheet of paper and is constantly updating it . it ' s not a planned seating chart . giorgio needs to meet opentable . 
hillstone is a solid place for a more expensive date night . it ' s generally populated by business suit wearing types after work and has round booths where you and your date can cozy up and have a romantic meal together . they have a very mixed menu from burgers to sushi to pan roasted salmon , so it ' s a great spot if you don ' t know what type of food your date likes or both are in the mood for different types of cuisine . the higher end , classy atmosphere , the eclectic menu and the large wine list make it a great spot to bring your date . datenitenyc
jadis feels like a best kept secret that you ' ve just discovered . its warm , intimate and has an inviting old-world ambiance that makes you want to stay for awhile . the vibe is perfect for sipping on wine and sampling from the menu to your hearts delight . i come here to relax and unwind . perfection ! 
awesome place , sat outside and had a wonderful view of the sunset . our waitress was the bartender so had some really great drinks , she also offered some cool recipes . i started with the mojito which was deiish ! we also ordered a bottle of their house wine , for N it was sweet but went really well with the fish ! ! dinner and apps were really good and authentic . it was definately pricey but well worth it . . everyone was really nice and even the owner came out and asked how everything was , etc . i would definately go back ! 
i have been to mamoun ' s a few times fairly recently . i have yet to have a bad meal at mamoun ' s . granted it could be considered a " dive " but i believe it adds to the feel of mamoun ' s . the falafel ' s are absolutely amazing and at such an inexpensive price , why not ? in addition to a wide array of middle eastern food there is also turkish coffee and some traditional desserts such as baklava . the baklava is fresh and is also quite reasonably priced . the only thing that is a bit expensive at mamoun ' s is to use the hookah . i had hookah with my friend there and it was N which is pretty steep considering a new hookah can go for somewhere in the N range . sometimes it does get quite busy and can be a bit of a wait but overall it is a great experience and is authentic new haven . 
typical of what a lot of williamsburg restaurants are . overhyped , overpriced , decor-oriented , and very sub-par food . i ' m going to cut to the chase . the scotch egg was a good starter at a good price . the artichoke appy was a tiny serving for an entree price , and not worth it . the entrees that my girlfriend and i had were the halibut and lamb kebab . halibut . . . expensive and dry . lamb . . . did not taste like lamb . i couldn ' t identify what taste it was , so i sent it back and ordered the pork belly instead . pork belly is supposed to be somewhat fatty . . . yes , but it ' s not supposed to be N fat and a smidgen of meat . tried the desserts . . . . meh . if you have money to burn , and just want nice ambience , then this is your place . if you want good food , to go with nice ambience , there are plenty of better places than rye . 
been around forever the best soup base of any pho restaurant in chinatown ! prices are cheap food comes out quick waiters are fast definitely order the spring rolls ! freshly fried and the outter layer is extremely crunchy if you eat it fresh . their other location " grand bo ky " im not too sure of , not even sure why they opened that one recently . 
i ' ve been here twice for dinner . i didn ' t think my second time could be better than the first , but this place didn ' t fail me . the specials here are always great . the service is warm and friendly . they have one really great wine that we always order- it ' s one offered in their medium body flight , but i can ' t remember which one it is . the cheese plate is delicious . i can ' t wait to come back . 
i ' m basing my review on just one dish , the beef stomach pho . read a review earlier today , and it mentioned that there were a few dishes that most people won ' t try , so of course i went for it . the stomach was gelatinous , clear , and nothing like i ' ve ever seen . started with small bites , and found it to taste amazing . much better than expected . the regular beef in the dish was unlike most other pho places -- it had a great flavor , and a " fallen off the bone " quality . the soup base had a great flavor , although i would have liked it come a bit more spicy ( i added some hot sauce ) . i read some negative reviews regarding how they serve tea ( in paper cups ) . i had no problem with this , although the cups were small . the service was ok . nothing to write home about , but i didn ' t come here to be waited on hand and foot . i came for a great meal . that ' s what i got . oh , and i forgot to mention that my total bill was N . N . 
i love thai food . . . i hated this . . . it was just greasy , fried , sugary and just . . . well , gummy . none of which i associate with thai food . 
omg i love their N oysters ! ! ! i always get like N and eat them alone lol . the drinks are strong ! ! ! i only go for happy hour though because their full price menu is not friendly . 
one of the best general tso ' s chicken ive ever had . also try the honey couple ( chicken and beef in a spicy orange sauce ) . 
took a friend here based on the great reviews here on yelp and it did not disappoint . we both loved our meals . our waiter was excellent , the food and wine terrific . they give you a delicious bread basket with three toppings when you are seated . for dinner , i got the branzino , and my friend got the pork loin . and considering the size of the place , it wasn ' t too loud even though it was packed , which is a rare thing in nyc . i highly recommend . 
this place blows me away every time . between enough menu variety to keep you coming back and a very friendly deli atmosphere , this is my favorite deli . try the chicken cutlet sandwiches . i ' ve always believed a deli needs N things to be a true deli N ) original sandwiches - these guys nailed it with about N different sandwiches and wraps and daily special . mozz made in house and fantastic . obviously , you can always make your own . N ) good bread - boom . N ) friendly , easy to talk to employees . these guys are deli elite . dear food network , pay attention . 
i think i am in love with roast pork . . . . i finally got a chance to try the much-talked-about roast pork sandwiches . . . i went the monday after the Nth of july and found out that dinics had used up all their meat for that day as well as tuesday ' s ration . . ( they werent going to be open on tuesday as a result ) i finally got there on a friday . . oh heaven ! ! i am generally not a huge fan of pork because of that strong flavor that needs lots of spices to overpower it . . . but this . . this was perfect . they have it down to a science i had N different kinds of roast pork sandwiches - you an choose from sweet hot peppers , sharp provolone , broccoli rabe spinach spicy hot peppers with sharp provolone and spinach the mild sweet peppers and sharp provolon and broccoli rabe . i have to say , that i was a huge fan of the meat . perfectly roasted . the natural juices is incredibly balanced . the amount of fat to full on flavor is perfect . the meat is sliced thin and against the grain . . . i am telling you , this is my new favorite iconic philly sandwich . in the sandwiches , the sharp provolone is key in the spicy version . the pungent creaminess of the cheese works perfectly with the hot peppers . i was glad to go with the spinach on the spicy sandwich because the broccoli rabe in the milder version was far too watery and made the bread fall apart - difficult to eat . . but worth it . if you are planning on trying both spicy and mild . . . try the mild first becuase the spicy will overpower the flavor of the milder one . if you havent tried this . . go . . . go skip the cheesesteaks . . . ( you can always get that later because reading terminal market is only open until Npm . ) go stand in the long line . . it is so worth your time . 
excellent food and awesome atmosphere . a perfect brunch place . have to try the vanilla bean french toast ! !

my girlfriend had a cheesesteak in a flea market and loved it . . i looked online for the best cheesesteak and it dats pats ' s . . we drove to pats from brroklyn . . . we were very dissapointed . . . . it had no taste and hardly enough meat . . we were starving and still didnt really impress us at all . . . . not recommended if you are coming from out of town . . better buy aa steak and make it yourself
do not order delivery ! it took the food over two hours and the staff was less than helpful when i called for an update after an hour and a half . 
i was in philly visiting a friend and we were planning a nyc visit when i talked about going to budakkan , she told me " there is one here and it ' s divine " . and boy , was she right ! my experience was great from the get go , went with a group of friends and we each ordered something and shared everything . and it was so good ! we tried the ceasar salad , lobster rice , short ribs , lamb and mine was sea bass , which was awesome ! . very well prepared and buttery and soft and tasty ! . heaven ! . for cocktail i ordered the cilantro martini which is a must try ! ! . i was a bit disappointed they no longer serve the edamame ravioli , which i read on reviews here was to die for . ( our server was friendly and nice , overall a great experience . additionally , the place was packed , great , lively vibe and a fun place to hang out with your friends at . very nice decor and in the old city which is a fun place to visit as well . wouldn ' t mind going back . 
decent bar in the tribeca area , close to the subway . i had one cocktail that was gross . . . should have sent it back , tasted like pickle juice . but my friends all liked their drinks and the bartenders was nice and friendly . it ' s out of the way if you live up town . 
came to ruth ' s with friends , started with the calamari , which is awesome ! i had a steakhouse salad which was good as well . for my main course i went with the petit filet and green beans , both were incredible ! can ' t go wrong with ruth ' s ! 
first time i tasted i was introduce to a new level of steaks . i recommend this alooottt ! ! ! dont forget to ask for the special sauce ! ! 
i like shabu shabu there . i periodically visit this place for food , especially shabu shabu . however , honestly i would go some other place if there were options . . well , i could hardly find other shabu-shabu place in new york city , so always end up coming back this place . i ' m asia , and plenty of experience of shabu shabu . this place isn ' t bad , but i can ' t tell it ' s one of best place for food and it ' s price point . wiish there are more shabu-shabu place in new york . . 
this place is amazing in every way -- food , service , decor , ambience , clientele . chic , chic , chic ! the best grilled octopus i have ever had , and the dorado was heavenly . we ended the meal sharing a divine yogurt and berry compote dessert . this will become a regular haunt of mine . 
i ' m so glad i live around this place ! i usually order the N sandwich and an iced milk tea or iced honey tea . i buy from this place so many times that the people there recognize me haha . however , i realized the prices have increased by a lot over the years . i remember a sandwich used to cost only N . N . now it ' s almost close to N . anyhow , the sandwiches are still delicious so i will still order from this place regardless of the price . 
this place is a hidden gem that has undergone new management which is a change for the better . we were seated in minutes and got our drinks quickly . the apps started with chicken satay and calamari . both dishes were pretty good . i loved the calamari between the two . my favorite new entree is the crispy duck basil . get it ! ! ! it was flavorful and even had an option to make the spice more intense . please be aware that there is mild , spicy , hot , and thai hot which is the spiciest of all . i would definitely go back again and try another app and entree . also try to save room for dessert as well . 
i am writing about your eggplant parmigiana diner and also your meatball sub . my wife and i ordered as well as my father in law and let me tell you , you beat out our local pizzeria that we ve been going to . i guess we ve found our new eatery ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! thankyou via roma for your delicous menue ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we will surely be back soon , matt family
came here on a monday afternoon for some brunch with a friend around Npm . it was kinda busy but we were able to be seated right away . i don ' t think there were many people working because it took a really long time to get our order taken . i ordered the french toast and it was pretty good . it was a little greasy oily though , more than i ' m used to with my french toasts but it was still good . i think i would come back again , not too sure because the service was not that good
i recently had dinner at salinas . the restaurant is quite gorgeous and smells as beautiful as it looks , thanks to the impressive array of flowers found throughout the restaurant . perfect venue for a cozy , romantic dinner on a cold ( almost ) winter night . the food is inventive and delicious . the drinks could have been stronger , but they were pretty delectable . courteous staff and wonderful ambiance , hard not to love . 
the hubsters and i went here tonight to celebrate him being a fly dog daddy . we ' d seen it on ddd before moving here and knew we had to come . glad we did ! the food is inventive , fresh , and well-portioned and the staff was super friendly . and the beer ! oh , such good beer . all i can say is pace yourselves between the fried pickles , fried pork belly watermelon salad , and fried fish and chips ( me ) and fried chicken ( hubsters ) plus beer , we practically rolled out of the place . but it was worth it ! ! totally lived up to the hype ! 
we ' ve been going to the monarch , since it opened and have never been disappointed . the menu is varied enough to provide the usual diner specialties , but with a flair . their daily specials are very nicely planned and executed , and they have always tried to be as accommodating , as possible ( less oil , not too rare , etc . ) . but the one nice thing that brings us back is the consistency . they ' re consistent in everything they make , unlike many local diners who seem to vary their recipes , with the shift on duty . their service is really good , and although we have never been loyal to any one server , we ' ve come to know them all . their managers are all good , and they clearly have an eye on things . recently , they instituted a loyalty card , that accumulates points . five hundred points will get you a N gift card , the way i understand it . 
this is the best restaurant in new haven . we moved here from san francisco , and this place and steadily helped us mourn the loss of all the great food that city has to offer . barcelona changes its menu frequently , so there is always something new to try . our favorites ? --tuna tartare --citrus salmon --chorizo with figs --sweet potato fries with goat cheese --mushrooms with goat cheese basically , you can ' t go wrong when ordering off their tapas menu . their wine selection is fantastic as well , and their service is top-notch ! this place could make an absolute killing in san francisco . . . thankfully , it ' s right here in new haven ! 
in a nutshell food was excellent and this felt like a ' fancy ' dinner . details it ' s a bit more upscale of a place . . although that being said , i thought it really lacked decor and style . it felt like old white sheets draped everywhere or something . . . idk it wasn ' t what i was expecting inside . yet , because of the menu and the attire of the servers , it still felt upscale . our server was very polite and proper . the bread was yummy . they serve a platter of string beans and fried plantanos for your table to share with dinner . i feel like this is a good spot for a romantic dinner . with tip , dinner for N and an appetizer was around N . what i ordered -camarones ajillo - shrimp in garlic --umm yes please . this was honestly so good . . . we could not stop gobbling it up . . i can ' t really describe the garlic sauce but it was so tangy and good . . amazing shrimp . i want to go there now just for this appetizer haha . -solomillo troceado - filet mignon medallians in mushroom sauce --very , very good . and it was so much food that i had to eat the rest the next day . the mushroom sauce was just right and the steak was cooked so nicely . . my mouth is watering remembering this . -N estrella river california merlot --i feel silly even mentioning this , but for some reason i really loved this wine . granted , they didn ' t have a wine menu when we asked for one ( it was more like , do you want red or white ? ) , but this wine hit the spot and wasn ' t bitter how some merlots can be . i ' m actually searching for this in my local liquor store . the only negatives here -we weren ' t so sure if the hostess was the hostess . . she sort of hung back around the wall and didn ' t address us when we walked in . . and when we asked for a table she seemed almost confused and we thought she was a child waiting for her parents . kind of comical actually but def confusing . -and . . obviously this isnt don pepe ' s fault . . but really there was a couple making out all throughout dinner at their table . bahaha . 
everything was delicious ! that roasted chicken and potatos yummmm . have the ahh fuego cocktail it is balanced with a nice kick at the end . everyone was so friendly and looked like they were having a good time working ( which is a joy to see since so many restaurants in philly can feel stuffy ) we had a great time and we had some great food . dressed in black slacks and a blazer , seemingly the manager , stopped by our table to see how our evening was . she must have overheard us chatting about our anniversary because two minutes later two glasses of complimentary champagne was delivered . jose garces did it again with awesome food and great service we will be back as soon as we can ! ! 
went here this past weekend for brunch . didn ' t have any expectations since i didn ' t read reviews online , just went because its a byo and is nearby to our apartment . my husband and i decided to sit outside in their garden , and enjoy the fresh air . it was cold , but the waitress and maybe an owner ( ? ) came out to turn on the standing heater and moved it right up to our table . we decided to share the bacon mac and cheese and the blue fig sandwich . both were absolutely amazing . very fresh and we even watched them make the food through the windows . it was really neat . for dessert we shared chocolate scones , fresh out of the oven . our waitress was really pleasant and didn ' t try to oversell . she offered suggestions and was very attentive . we can ' t wait to visit again ! 
i was staying in the area and looking for a neat place to grab dinner . i decided to come here for the veggie burger and i was very satisfied with my decision ! everything everybody else has said about it is true . the veggies are julienned , which makes for a unique texture and taste that ' s very different form most veggie patties . the steak fries were also quite tasty . during happy hour , i think it ' s like N , which is an awesome price . 
maybe my expectations were too high , but i was slightly disappointed by the food at cafe gitane ( please understand that i grew up in france eating tons of north-african food , so i ' m also a little hard to please when it comes to that type of cuisine ) . i went with my boyfriend for a late lunch on a saturday afternoon . the place was pretty packed , but we were seated almost right away . i first had the soup of the day carrot ginger cream soup , which came with bread and was actually quite tasty ( though i wish it had been a little warmer , but i ' m nitpicking ) . i then ordered the moroccan couscous with merguez sausages ( spicy lamb sausages ) while the sausages were delicious ( and by far the highlight of the meal ) , the couscous was very disappointing . moroccan couscous typically is a big stew of meat and vegetables with a lot of sauce , which you eat together with the grain . what they served me was grain mixed up with some vegetables ( few of which would have been in a real moroccan couscous ) , and hardly any sauce at all it was very dry and not very flavorful . . . a letdown ( not to brag , but i can probably whip up a better and more authentic moroccan couscous at home ) . my bf had the heart of palm salad with chicken , which turned out to be pretty tasty . besides the food , the place is pretty nice , and the service was good . i was very surprised when i noticed the old map of morocco on the wall same edition and print as the maps we used to have hanging in our classrooms in france when i was in elementary school . . . i ' d be very curious to find out where they dug it up , and it certainly did bring back some old memories . nice place , but the food could have been a little better . N-N N stars . 
we stopped in around N pm after dinner for some of the famous cheesecake . definitely worth it ! we went with the raspberry swirl and it was by far the best cheesecake i ' ve ever had ( and i ' m a girl who loves her cheesecake ! ) . it was the perfect temperature with a great spongecake " crust " and big enough to share . to make the experience even better was our extremely nice , prompt and helpful waiter . we ' ll definitely be back ! 
i ' m not sure if the restaurant owners themselves market this place as a mexican restaurant or everyone who recommends this place just assumed it is . in either case , one or both of those groups have no idea what they ' re talking about . this place isn ' t authentic mexican and it fails in whatever fusion crap it is trying to do instead . the margaritas are strong . that ' s a plus . they ' re beer selection is pathetic . yea i ' m not sure why this place exists because it isn ' t cheap either . go to mezcal if you want mexican . actually , go to the taco trucks on long wharf if you want something worth your time and money . 
we normally have the pizza there and it is very good , a nice balance in the amount of cheese and sauce . the sauce has a distinct taste that we like . service is good and friendly . other dishes have been good but we haven ' t tried enough to give a full review . 
best mac n cheese of all time anywhere ever . love this place ! really good cocktails . phenomenal old fashion . great staff
i love going this place find my beer and getting sandwiches when i can- i will recommend it to anyone . 
the place is noisy with workers bickering at each other . the food is good , i had the fried calamari and chicken , both were well thought out dishes but the chicken was a little over salted . the bartender tara is amazing as well as her cocktails . one waiter cursed at her while we were eating at the bar . i suggest it you go there , don ' t sit at the bar if you want a peaceful dinner . 
pretty good dim sum . i like the xiao long bao . i would come back to this restaurant . 
something has changed about this place . i ' ve eaten here dozens and dozens of time , but the last N have definitely been a let down . same items , but it sure doesn ' t taste the same . can ' t pin down what exactly it is , but i ' m going to give it another shot before finding another izakaya to patronize . 
some of the worst food i ' ve ever had . chicken was burned . the place was dirty and service was poor . 
we love to try new places , one server hostess busser on duty , she was fantastic ! after a short wait for a table on a busy saturday night , we started our night with my new favorite drink , the slamhound , . ice tea vodka , st germain and grapefruit juice . the food was delicious , crayfish bisque ( spicy ) and gumbo , both great . grilled romaine with shrimp and a trout with mushroom grits ( im not a grits fan ) . the dessert was killer brioche bananas foster bread pudding . took half home for breakfast wow ! ! ! highly recommended
i ' m embarrassed to say that when i saw the dude with the scratchbread tattoo , i blurted oh , omg you ' re the scratchbread guy ! ! ! i can ' t help it . i get giddy in the presence of greatness . - the bread is only the beginning . the savory scone ( danish blue with toasted oat and date ) will change your whole reason for living . and i think i need to introduce myself to the savory muffin as well . you know . for variety . 
been here about N times since it became in riva and have yet to have a bad experience - awesome pizzas and decent wine selection . 
nice authentic italian food . the desserts were great ! ! 
i go here for a meeting about once a month . if it had not been held here , i would have never stepped foot inside . i have never had the coffee but i have had their salads and their wraps . food is outrageous , portions are large and prices are reasonable . i ' ve witness others in our group nibble on the desserts and they look amazing . service is very attentive and everyone is quite pleasant . don ' t miss this one ! 
surprised by the positive reviews . this was the worst food i have ever had . masala sauce was sickeningly sweet and not much else . . . totally bland of the flavors i was expecting . it was also luke warm like it had been poorly microwaved . chicken was under cooked and not edible . ordered garlic naan it was soggy and needed more garlic . the samosa was the only saving grace and was actually quite good unfortunately the sauces provided were awful . sick to my stomach for only N plus a tip , heck of a deal . . . . 
my annual trip to china for work doesn ' t look like it happening this year , and because of that this summer has been the summer of chinese food ( and lots of running because of it ) . the latest installment shanghai soup dumplings . i have flown out of shanghai twice but never had the chance to try a famous soup dumpling so joe ' s shanghai in china town would have to suffice . first off there is the technique , you pick up the top of dumpling carefully with your chop sticks and place it in the soup spoon , then once safely on your plate you gently puncture the top of the dumpling to let the soup cool , at this point you can suck a little soup out if you so desire , then once the dumpling is cool enough you attempt the eat the whole thing . biting into this wonderful morsel is new experince in itself , first soft sticky dumpling skin , then the rush of the soup and finally the meaty center . it is like a party in your mouth . we had other food as well but the soup dumpling was the star ! 
cost best for lunch , dinner is the same menu just more expensive . its also less crowded and the staff is more attentive . atmosphere incredible ceiling height in the front upstairs . warm coastal feel to it . 
i love el comerio . it is difficult to find a genuine puerto rican restaurant . " latin restaurants " exist on every corner but el comerio is a rare find . i have literally travelled hours to eat here . i love it . 
the hibachi sushi are great well worth the price . i get a better deal here than a sit down joint the buffet is typical with a carving sections . this is the place to got for sushi hibachi . 
my family usually goes to iberia peninsula for portuguese food , so we decided to try something new this time around . . . thoroughly enjoyed my mariscada in green sauce . super delicious . sangria was superb too and such a steal at only N pitcher . this restaurant will be added to our rotation for sure . 
i went to the new location in chelsea market . short line at lunchtime , and they were very quick making my order . i got the N combo with the mighty mang roll , tofu piece , and carrot piece . it was delicious , and gorgeously presented . love the tasty spicy dipping sauce that comes in the little test tube . will definitely be returning for lunch again - for just over N with tax , it comes out to be a pretty good deal . only complaint is that the roll didn ' t really stick together when i picked it up . 
silk city is one of the most under-rated brunch spots in philly . their brunch menu is excellent and full of comfort food faves fried chicken and waffles kick ass , but huevos rancheros and breakfast flatbreads are great , too . dinner also rocks . and lunch , too . so i guess what i ' m saying is you can ' t go wrong any time of day . esp if you eat in the expansive garden or enjoy a cocktail at the outdoor bar . be prepared to wait . but not as long as honeys or fried eggs . 
la viola is your typical philadelphia byo fare . they do take reservations but it is unlikely you will be seated promptly . we arrived on time for our N N reservation and were not seated until after N . there is no room for a waiting area so you are forced to stand in the hallway of the apartment also located in this building . much of this is due to the fact that they would never rush your meal or force you out which can be viewed positively . once you are seated the table is yours for the length of a reasonable italian dinner regardless of who is standing in the hallway . the restaurant floor is very small as you would expect so this isn ' t your place if you intend to have a private conversation . on the plus side i thought the food was excellent and fairly inexpensive . our meal which included two appetizers two entrees and coffee was under N before gratuity . as someone who gets easily frustrated when forced to wait , la viola started off on the wrong foot , but i think the quality of the food , diversity of the menu and the price was able to compensate . overall , i give the food four stars but the inconvenience factor brings them down to an average rating . i would give this place another try but there are just too many other great byo ' s out there where the service is as good as the food . . . . 
this place is awesome ! ! ! ! ! N stars all the way . phenomenal wine beer list . . . amazing pizza . . . excellent service . . . everything about this place is perfect
N star its fine for this place , foot was not bad but service was so slow and i dont like the ambiance . 
great burgers , great beers and loveley waitress that i fell in love with her tattoos . def i ' m comming back ! ! ! 
great service , great live music and amazing food ! 
good samwich . vietnamese style . why go there ? they have good vietnamese sammiches . have one . and the lychee shakes are good too . 
cash only place . it ' s yummy . i liked it a lot . i ordered a lot of fried things and loved it . yumz ! 
one word - it ' s a super hero ! you will thank me for recommending me this deli sub - i now go here twice a week for my veggie sub . i highly advise everyone to try the boom boom sauce ! ! ! 
really great food and service . some of the dishes are definitely eclectic and you have to have a taste for different . the stuffed dates and meatballs are just superb . tried a few of their specials and they are equally enjoyable . the staff will explain everything so if you have any questions or are iffy on something , just ask . 
this place is amazing . it is like visiting an italian relative for a home cooked meal . well , i don ' t know that for sure because i have no italian relatives but it is what i would imagine it to be like . i have been here N times and always lose track of how many courses they bring out . just be prepared for a constant onslaught of food from the kitchen for about N hours . home made pizzettas , stuffed peppers , polenta with meat sauce , chips and peppers , manicotti , pasta , more pasta , watermelon salad with basil ( awesome ! ) , filet mignon , veal - it goes on and on . they are byob so be sure to bring your own wine . we normally bring a few bottles to last through dinner , depending on the size of our party . this is a great place for special occasions . we prefer to sit in the garden room - it is private , seats up to N and is near the kitchen and bathroom . the service is wonderful as well . be sure to explore the upstairs of the home or take a walk in the garden after the pasta course to keep the juices flowing so you can make it to the end . always need espresso at the end of the meal so i don ' t fall asleep on the way home ! too good ! 
best pizza delivery in new haven . no , its not pepe ' s or sally ' s or modern , or bar , but when you want just a good standard style pizza delivered to you , est . is the way to go . also , the fresh vegetable toppings are better than any of the other gourmet pizza places around . 
good food , but the wait . the wait ! maybe i ' m too old to wait N hours for dinner ? when you are so hungry , even the delicious food doesn ' t win you over . 
definitely a good option for solid vietnamese . standard vietnamese fare . a lot of the usual . good service , good atmosphere . awesome smoothies , too ! we will return . ask for phil . phil is the man . 
the little owl to me is the perfect restaurant . the space is so quaint and inviting . there is nothing pretentious about it . and the food is absolutely amazing . they don ' t try to make things overcomplicated , or bring too many flavors together . they take something that seems simple , and make it taste out of this world . i came here once for dinner about N years ago and have considered it my favorite restaurant ever since . i finally made it back to new york recently and going to the little owl was at the top of my list of places to eat . i came for lunch this time ( couldn ' t get short notice reservations for dinner ) , and it was just as perfect as i had remembered it . i had the artic char and a side of the chive mashed potatoes . everything was lovely . i found myself savoring each and every bite because who knows when i ' ll be back again . and so i must say good bye to this darling little owl again . manhattan , do take good care of her while i am gone . 
i don ' t know what the guy who wrote a review before is talking about . this place is so good one of the most delicious chinese restaurants in town . i ve been eating here for so long and i have never had a problem with their food . the taste is excellent and the service is even better . they are so sweet and its a great restaurant . i have lived in rutherford all my life and there is no other chinese and japanese restaurant that i would even think of going to . 
i was staying at the chelsea inn next door while visiting my daughter . petite abeille has an arrangement with the inn to provide a continental breakfast which i enjoyed almost every morning for a week . i also stopped by most afternoons for a beer before heading out for the evening . after a couple days the staff recognized me and were out-of-the-way hospitable . incredibly friendly folks . god bless dorene who often works the counter . felt like she was part of my family after a week at the chelsea . belgian beers to die for . also enjoyed a lovely dinner . if this place was in my neighborhood i would be a regular . 
it ' s true . you can ' t get a real bagel outside of the nj nyc area and this place does it the best . the bagels are always hot , no matter what time you come and come in many flavors . so much better than the overhyped h h in nyc . the employees are a bit odd , but if you can get past that , you ' re in for a real treat . if you ' re ever in the area and want to see what a real bagel tastes like , you have to stop by here . 
N crown is a elegant laid back , can be romantic place . the food was good , but drinks high priced . the menu that is on their website is outdated , so you can not go by that that was my mistake because i wanted to order a salad and beef bbq ribs which they had neither . i was disappointed about that , but overall , it is a really cozy place to relax and chill with some friends or a partner . 
i have come for drinks many times over the years , but it has been a long time since i ate here . when we arrived it was packed and were told there was a N min wait , and surprisingly we didn ' t have to wait more than N to N min for a booth . i had the asian spiced tuna burger and it was delicious . just a note though , the waitress seemed very quick to want to take away our " empty " beer bottles . keep your bottles cans as far from the edge of the table as possible to ensure you are actually finished drinking before your beer is prematurely swiped . 
after a long drive , we found a parking garage on grove street and had about N minutes to grab lunch before a scheduled college tour . this place was just down the block from the garage and no one in our party objected , so in we went . ordering here is confused . they ask you some questions in order to build your sandwich , but then after you sit down they tend to think of more questions they should have asked . some of our party had gone back to the restroom , so it was a chore to get everyone ' s input . then they ran out of bread . admittedly , it would probably have been even more of an embarrassment if they ' d run out of bagels , but still - no bread ? my daughter was surprised by her bagel-based sandwich , but didn ' t complain . plus , i wouldn ' t think the lunch rush had even begun yet , so this seemed odd . the food itself was okay , but not spectacular . if you ' re running late , park next door , and like bagels a lot , then this might still be a good choice for you . otherwise , i ' d keep walking or re-visit yelp . . . 
a place that understands brown spirits and doesn ' t worship flavored rubbing alcohol , um , vodka , deserves a visit . and do they understand the brown spirits . red vermouth-their blend and very good . a respect for the cocktail without being oh-so-trendy ( the old fashioned and negronis looked and smelled good ) . i know folks come here for the burgers , but their variation of kentucky browns was quite tasty and savory . yes , there isn ' t much seating , but go for the bar the bartenders are artists but not interested in being bar gods . a very good restaurant experience without being a restaurant experience . 
so much cheaper than neighboring west chelsea lunch options with a great atmosphere and a backyard garden to enjoy . they have good lunch specials all week but great singular menu items which won ' t get too pricy either . i love their goat cheese and organic field greens salad , which they always serve with a pound of fresh bread , much to my dismay . perfect for eat in or take out . and i believe they deliver too . ladies and gents - they do not have diet coke . you have been warned . the " no diet coke , no skim milk , no decaf coffee " caveat on the menu ain ' t no joke . 
never had a chance to try it . we went for our N N reservation , which they called to confirm , on black friday . with more than N people waiting and theatre tickets , we had to walk out at N N . the place was so overbooked that people were waiting in between tables where people were eating . horrible experience . . . 
first visit ever this evening with my family and two of my son ' s baseball buddies . very nice decor and we were seated quickly . the food was very good and we covered most of the menu . . . . . eggplant chicken parms , pasta , salads , soups , burgers , breakfast food , appetizers . the menu isn ' t very large as with most diner menus . portions were pretty generous as far as diners go and the kids happily gobbled everything in front of them . . . . . picky ones included . the prices were very fair and breakfast items seemed to be a good value . cons the water tasted a bit funny . . . . off metallic taste . the onions rings were just so-so in that they were a bit thin and the breading didn ' t stick ( they ' ve got nothing on red robin onion rings ) . the salad leaves were a bit large in size . . . . difficult to eat but very fresh and tasty . our waitress was very helpful but disappeared for a short span when we needed the check . verdict definitely a very good diner imo . prices are fair and portions are good - tasty food . i would drive the N minutes to go back and visit again . 
the ambiance is amazing , the food is decent . guacamole was pretty good and they had a lot of choices for it , the margarita was very disappointing to say the least . for the entree i had the sea bass tacos which were good . pricey , parking was not ideal , it was very noisy , but a fun atmosphere . 
i don ' t understand the hype . the pizza was mediocre , greasy , and inferior to most chain delivery pizza places . just save yourself the wait and get delivery from domino ' s instead . bar pizza in new haven is far superior . this just seems to be one of those famous-because-it ' s-famous places . 
this restaurant was recommended to me by a co-foodie . it was the best meal i have had in about a year . pork buns were unreal , unbelievable yellow tail ( hamachi carpaccio ) and maguro sashimi apps . the two of us shared the karaka-men with a poached egg on top . it was suggested we order extra noodles if we had broth left over but we were stuffed by then . fantastic service , waiter was so enthusiastic about us having the right experience given that we were newbies ! 
this is a very cute family owned restaurant . the breakfast was hot quick and very good . they have daily specials and always have a sugar free dessert which is great . staff is friendly and make you feel at home . this is one of the best breakfast places around
excellent brunch menu . my girlfriend and i split the steak sandwich and avocado toast , which are staples of the restaurant ( although they went light on the avocado . . . ) well located in a cozy little spot in the east village . nice casual ambiance , very good service . bloody mary ' s were o . k . 
hands down one of the best sandwich shops i ' ' ve ever been to , not just in new jersey , but in the whole country . the food is amazing ( love the N with everything and the grilled chicken panini . . . its all good but those are my favs ) and these guys really know how to make a sandwich . i once heard one of the guys instructing a new hire on how to correctly make a sandwich . . . you should have heard the passion and the detail in the instructions . . . when to put the lettuce on , what order the toppings should be arranged in , how to put the oil and vinegar on so it doesn ' t soak the bread , absolute fanaticism for the perfect sub . if you get there and there ' s a long line , don ' t stress it , they go through it so fast you ' ll be done before you know it . and everyone there is so nice , always ready with a smile or a joke , and they either remember your name , or your order , or both . i really can ' t recommended this place enough . 
a good steakhouse should offer quality and service . thie alexus steakhouse offers neither . i came with my gusets for a sunday dinner . we oredered onion soups . the soup was delivered lukewarm not hot . we had to send the soup back . when the soup was returned the server did not know the basics for serving . we oredered porterhouse steaks . the waitress delivered the steaks but literally disappeard . we wanted to have steak sauce but the waitress was nowhere to be found . at a steakhoiuse you would expect to have have glasses of glass not plastic glasses that would be served at a diner . the tableclothes were not ironed but wrinkled with stain marks . the clothe napkins were old with holes in them . it they apepared to be like rewashed rags . perhaps this is more of a restaurant for hamburgers and beer . this should not be called a steak house . i cannot recommend this restaurant for a steak loiver . . 
this has to be the weirdest lunch time experience i ' ve had , easily . i ' ve seen lunch specials in the window before , and i ' m always up for trying something new , so i figure i ' d give it a try today . i waltz in to a nearly empty , dark , david fincher-esque looking room with circular booths on each side of me and a small bar at the end . some yalies are conversing over bloody mary ' s at one of the booths , and a man sits alone at the bar . he ' s just taken off his jacket so i know he didnt ' arrive much sooner than me . i sat down at the bar , the middle aged bartender looked at me as if to say " you don ' t belong here " . i asked for a lunch menu and she slid one down to me and walked away . the jukebox was pumping out a mix of old-school rap ala run-dmc , beastie boys , naughty by nature , krs-one . . . the owner his son were standing in a booth behind me repairing some light fixtures . i ordered the open-faced roast beef , which the menu stated came with potatoes vegetable . the bartender quickly informs me they ' re out of roast beef so i settle on the turkey . i asked , " what are my potato choices " , and the bartender gave me a puzzled look . i expected to hear a list back . . something like " fries , mashed , baked . . . etc " . she says , " comes with mashed " . it comes out looking as appetizing as a shoe , like something my mom slapped together for a hangover lunch after a friday night bender . dry , flavorless turkey straight out of the store bought deli container . microwaved , frozen mixed vegetables coated in margarine , some canned cranberry sauce . the one saving grace was that the mashed potatoes were homemade . i liberally applied salt pepper and the seasoning made it edible . the potatoes were good , the turkey sandwich was ok , the veggies i could have done without . even dives can put forth the effort to serve something that looks decent , but in this instance , there was no effort . i don ' t get places that serve food when the bulk of their sales is alcohol . . you know you can fit alot more bar stools if you take out the kitchen . 
in all fairness , i ' ve only been to pumpkins once and it was for brunch . i ordered the breakfast burrito . it was alright , but pretty bland and dry . it could have used some tomatoes or other vegetables and it would have been better without the potatoes . judging by the other reviews , maybe dinner is better ? i ' m not sure if i ' m up to finding out . . . 
this is not a foodie ' s place . it is , as best i can describe it , an aspiring literary woman ' s hangout . in terms of decor and atmosphere , it is a rather ambitious oh-so-very-quaint shabby-chic faux farmhouse with depression-era-looking tables and a pastel color scheme , but it lacks imagination and feels inauthentic . i don ' t remember what they had playing in the background , but there is something very sarah mclachlan-ish about this place -- an impression confirmed by the fact that virtually all of the patrons were women ( at the height of the lunch hour on a weekday , and only a block away from park avenue ) . not that there is anything wrong with that -- but . . . you know . okay , enough bashing the twee decor , what about the food ? i ' d say , the lunch menu is boring and the execution did not leave me wanting to try dinner . yes , fried calamari is supposed to be breaded , but the amount of breading in penelope ' s calamari is just obscene . the fried calamari salad came heaping with papaya -- i would remind the chef that any unusual combination of ingredients requires delicacy . ten points for ambition , none for mastery . the chicken meatball salad also left much to be desired . i generally like salads where warm meats are added to greens , but the arugula underneath the meatballs was not merely wilted -- it was cooked indicating that the meatballs were added to the greens while still sizzling , instead of being allowed to cool slightly , as any competent chef would have done . the meatballs themselves were very nice , but it seems penelope is unsure whether it wants to be primarily comfort-food or eclectic -- and fusing the two evidently is not working out . in short , the food is mediocre and the space is tacky . give this one a pass . 
my boyfriend and i walked in here on a friday night at about N N . we had been wandering the east village looking for somewhere with a short wait and good food , not an easy find . at yerba buena we were seated right away . the restaurant is small and cozy , a perfect first date place , not too fancy , not too casual with the right sort of ambiance ( dim lights , candles , intimate seats ) . the drink menu is eclectic with lots of interesting combinations . we opted for mojitos which were delicious . the food was amazing and the service impeccable . we ordered a bunch of appetizers and the waiter forgot our ceviche and felt so bad we each received two complimentary glasses of champagne . i highly recommend this place and will be back soon . 
i was looking forward to going to locanda . went for lunch . first observation is that it ' s an extremely noisy room . not a great place for a relaxed conversation . the waiter was inexperienced and the busboy took away a plate before my colleague was finished , so not particularly high marks for service . the food was decent but overpriced . N bucks for a tomato salad with some watermelon chucked in and N for three scallops in an unexceptional corn puree . not worth the money , unless it ' s going on your corporate card . 
wait and bus staff do not wash their hands after , blowing their noses , wiping sweat off their faces , washing tables with used rags , then serving your food . discusting health habits . 
this place is great . great food , service , and you always meet some friends when your there ! 
the architecture and design of this place are impressive . it was bigger than i expected and a bit crowded and noisy ( i had the sense it was more upscale and intimate than it is ) . that said , the service was crazy good and so was the food . the wine list could be improved . the homemade passion fruit ice cream was divine . 
garbage place
this place just as advertised by my friends . when i walked inside i decided to go for the old staple , a burger and fries . then i scanned the menu and realized they had shakes so i got the trifecta . all three were fantastic choices . within minutes our waitress had delivered the food onto the patio . the burger , although not large , packed a punch and had shiny , crunchy bread . the bacon on it was nice and crispy as well . the shake hit the spot as my drink and i have to say the best part was their sweet potato fries . a little on the expensive side but well worth it . one of the gems in the south orange village . 
nice , simple place to go to grab some lunch . i particularly enjoy the chicken sandwich here , and the fries are amazing . i ' ve never gone here for the bar , but it seems like a good , small hangout to catch a phillies game or something . oh and the outdoor seating is nice , for the most part . 
i don ' t often give a place N stars , but highlands just really rocks . it has great cocktails , wine selection , unique drafts , and of course an enormous selection of whiskey and scotch . it ' s also a really sexy , but relaxed , atmosphere . i ' ve been there dozens times for cocktails and about a handful of time for food . while scotts aren ' t generally known for their culinary savant , the chef here really does excellent things for scottish cuisine ' s reputation in nyc . everyhting that i ' ve eaten there has been delicious , i really cannot recall disliking anything . on a recent visit i was particularly wow ' ed by the scallops appetizer . service is fantastic ! but come on an off night . fri sat can get unbearably busy ! 
these folks are doing excellent work . the highlight is really the decor . the refinished this place so nicely . awesome woodwork . the place used to be a very noisy , echo-y place . now , it ' s a lot more welcoming because of the influx of wood . as to the food , i did small plates - hush puppies that had a unique flavor and nice crispy texture on the outside , but soft on the inside , and i also had a creamy fish chowder , which was delicious . we were eating late , around ten pm , and we had a group of seven . they seated us quickly , everyone was gracious , and they got the food out to us very quickly . i see a comment complaining about the quality of the service . i ' m sure that ' s possible , depending on who you get . our service , on the other hand , was great . the waitress was attentive , but not overbearing . i thought the pricing was excellent , and this makes a nice addition to the burlington food scene . i can ' t wait to go back . 
i ' ve been here so many times . day or night they never disappoint . granted the wait can get pretty long if you show up at N a . m . on a saturday or N p . m . on a friday but the food is worth the wait every time . do yourself a favor and get the mac n cheese and tomato soup . amazing . 
the morning of day N brings us back to the reading terminal market . in philadelphia . i checked on yelp the night before and was guided to the dutch eating place because of the great reviews . we walked up to look at their menu and a couple was leaving their barstools which would allow the four of us to sit down . they said , " it ' s fantastic food , but be careful what you order . everything is huge portions ! " that was no understatement . we ordered blueberry pancakes , a side of bacon , a side of sausage , a side of breakfast potatoes , milks for the kids and orange juice for the adults . our total was N ! ! ! let me say the pancakes come three to an order and are the size of hubcaps , literally . they rank up there with some of the best i have ever had . the breakfast potatoes were lightly seasoned with lawry ' s season salt . they were perfectly cooked . one of the reviewers on yelp said , " i have a crush the amish " . i could not agree more ! 
loved the poached egg salad and wine , but the salad was a limited time item ( love the ambiance . i feel happy and sophisticated when i go there- very courteous staff . a nice gem near columbia university ! 
i just tried out this place today and fell in love . the food portions are very generous , prices are reasonable , and the curry is amazing ! i ordered the chicken , and was pleasantly surprised ( i had a less-than-stellar chicken experience at a different japanese place , which made me suspicious ) . the chicken was juicy and flavorful , and the breading was tasty . the only problem i had was that i wanted more . there was a massive amount of curry sauce over everything- no worries about having sad , naked rice . plus , the people working there were super friendly , and the food was done in a flash . i ' m already planning my next trip over there ) 
great cuban food for a tiny " hole-in-the-wall " place . i was told to try the chicken soup , which wasn ' t great but the cuban sandwich was really good . 
love this place . never been disappointed . service is great . i order " off menu " - they make a great lemon chicken ( sauce in on the side , not soaking the chicken ) , but don ' t tell anyone . the staff is always pleasant . 
i stopped here on my way home from buying my awesome new running shoes and since i left a review for them , i had to stop by and write up a quick one for this fabulous place ! love pretty much everything here . you really can ' t go wrong . the hardest part is figuring out what to get . i usually get a panini but also indulged with a cheese plate this time as well . oh and get dessert ! i usually don ' t go for the crumbs cupcakes since they are outrageously large and would rather fill up on crostini , antipasti etc ! ! 
ok - little gem in the uws - who would have thought . nice how i can walk to it from home - but the food is great - menu is varied and food comes out looking good . drinks menu is good too - sangria and a bunch of other cocktails i wouldn ' t mind giving a shot . seating is comfortable with a bar area to wait for a table and throw down some drinks . not pretentious , but versatile - catch up with mates ? hang out with family ? dine a date ? good for all this . oh they have decent ceviche too ! cuban style steak dishes are great . will be back with the family . update aug N N been back twice and dined at other cuban restaurants . knocking this back to N stars . there are others in the uws worth checking out . not with the same decor and vibe as this but actually better dishes and drinks e . g . havana in the Ns uws ) 
i ' ve now been to agricola five times - three for meals and twice just for drinks . i hadn ' t written any comments because it ' s new , and i thought it fair to wait several months until the kinks were worked out . bottom line it isn ' t worth your time and money . the food is not special , many of the ingredients aren ' t local at all because they ' re out of season , and there ' s nothing on the menu that is unique or can ' t be ordered elsewhere . every restaurant needs a few " can ' t touch anywhere else items " and agricola has not a single one . the service is cold , absent and uncaring . there are many people , but they mostly are talking to each other or standing behind the bar doing nothing . there are too many great places within a block to spend time here . the atmosphere and design are ok , but not enough to offset the kitchen . and , while i usually don ' t weigh quality with price , agricola is extremely expensive , even if it were great . you ' re paying for superior service and extraordinary food you ' re getting something worth a lot less . i ' m sad about all of this , because i like businesses to be successfully , especially locally owned and operated ones . but i really hope the owner and chef are reading these comments and does a makeover . the general buzz in town is turning negative , time is short , and people have a lot of options . 
i don ' t really like the scene at the spotted pig . it ' s still too much of an ordeal . but nobody else makes gnudi in brown butter sauce like they do . it ' s a N star dish that dreams are made of . 
the staff is excellent . the food is healthy and super delicious ! ! keep up the great work ! ! 
super fresh bread and nice ingredients . the wait can be extensive . . . . but don ' t let that put you off . this is home to one of the best hoagies in the city . 
this place was so great in my birthday . the service here is so friendly and excellent . the food here the taste so good . the taste areopagus with korea and western stlyes
oh man , i really wanted to love the famous burger but i couldn ' t do it . it ' s a solid burger but nothing special and it runs in the Nish range . the server was brusque , rushed , and didn ' t speak english . once upon a time , this was probably an amazing place to grab a beer and a burger but i ' m guessing the tourist trade destroyed it . 
i can ' t say enough about this place . to start we arrived at about N N pm , only N minutes before closing and were greeted by by the owner and assured that it wasn ' t too late to sit in and eat . alicia has got to be the friendliest person i ' ve ever been waited on or served by . an added bonus was the same awesome pizza that i had remembered eating when i was younger at their original juniata location . i ' m just bummed that i don ' t live closet because this would most definitely be my family ' s " go to " pizza shop restaurant . if you haven ' t tried this place , do it . you ' ll be in for a really big treat ! ! ! ! ! 
i must say , the brunch is pretty good . i really enjoyed the chips and salsa . the best part , i ordered a mojito . the bartender wasn ' t happy with the one that she made so she sent me a second one for free . you can ' t beat that kind of service . my friend and i are looking forward to coming back . 
i ' m not sure i can say anything about this place that hasn ' t already been written . it is amazing . every detail , and every ingredient is spot on . i was there for brunch and thought that my meal was utter perfection . i also , found the price to be reasonable considering the overall quality of the food . moreover , the atmosphere was spacious and comfortable and the fact they allow you to bring your own makes even more enjoyable . i ' m excited to go back here sometime in the future . 
coq au vin ( a star off for the exceedingly cramped space ) ! ! 
very authentic , taste good just as its name says ) best malaysian food we ever had . 
nice place , good ambiance , it ' s feels comfortable as soon as we got in . they decorate the place with pictures of peoples having fun with their reusable bowls , which is very fun to see . the cashier is nice , she tried hard to communicate with my N years old daughter . i love the thai chicken crunch salad , with spicy thai peanut dressing ! heard the cajun grilled shrimp is also good , that will be in next list for sure , and to get my extras ( if you use the reusable bowl , you get N free essential toppings or one free cheese ! ! ! ) . 
it ' s my Nnd time here and i ' m not even done with my meal and i ' m already looking forward to my Nrd ! the prices are definitely not the as the listing says . the bagels are great i just had a wheat bagel with egg whites , tomato and their homemade hot sauce ! maybe i ' m a little jaded because i love hot sauce , but i think this place is the best breakfast sandwich place in south brunswick thus far ! ( we just moved here last week and have been eating out consistently ) there are opportunities for a little cleanliness , but that ' s things you can fix , the recipes you cannot - and that ' s what makes this place great ! definitely check this place out if your looking for a breakfast spot ! 
the atmosphere here is really fun ! the tapas and sangria were absolutely delicious . even though it was busy we didn ' t have to wait that long . i would definitely come here again . 
mac n cheese and the beet salad were the top contenders ! ! the place is slightly dark but the decor is cute and industrial-like , very wiliamsburg-ish . the staff was excellent - the drinks selection were nice . it ' s not a huge place so if you are going to show up , avoid peak hours , unless you have to . i also tried the country chicken steak and the fried chicken . the grits were made slightly different . . . but it was still yummy . very good place . we ' re definitely coming back again ! 
without a doubt one of the best " bang for your buck " spots in newark . huge portions and really affordable . get in early or you ' ll be leaving depressed . one sub will usually be enough for lunch and dinner . good stuff
had the most bizarre experience here tonight that will make me never come back . ( not that i would have anyway ) firstly the ramen here is pretty good ( which is not the reason for the one star , more on that later ) . i had the miso ramen which was yummy for a chicken broth based soup . at first it tasted like i was eating chicken soup which i wasn ' t used to but i adjusted to it after biting into all of the yummy components of the dish . the pork was succulent , the egg was fully cooked ( some say it should be runny ) , and the noodles were good . the broth was a little too salty to me . i ' d say the best part of the dish were the noodles , they had the perfect level of chewiness and nice yellow color . my friend who is averse to pork had the same dish with chicken instead and it was not nearly as good . the chicken had that leftover chicken taste and was dry . was the ramen good , yes , was it better than any run of the mill ramen place on saint marks or anywhere else , no . it definitely didn ' t hold a candle to ippudo . so here is why i ' m giving this place a one star , after i paid and left , an employee ran out of the store and tried to force me to give a bigger tip in front of the crowd of people waiting outside . maybe this was some sort of triumph for waiters everywhere but i found this extremely unprofessional and ridiculous . admittedly , i left a bad tip . however , i think my tip was justified . after waiting for an hour we were finally bustled in and sat down . oh , i forgot to mention they don ' t take cash so i had to run around the corner to the bank and take out money ( with all the hype and business they get they can ' t upgrade allow credit ? ) there was water in cups already at our table . we ordered the food and when it was ready , some guy who wasn ' t our waiter quickly plopped my dish in front of me with his thumb almost in the ramen . i thought he was someone who just came into eat because he had a winter jacket and hat on then i realized he worked there . he yelled miso ramen in my ear and i asked him if it was the chicken or pork because my friend and i ordered both and he just yelled " miso ramen " again . luckily another guy ( i think our waiter ? ) had the next dish and said that ' s the pork and this is the chicken and more carefully placed it down . during the duration of our meal our water was not refilled . after we finished our bowls were quickly taken away and they laid down the check . i left my usual tip of just doubling the tax but then as i was putting on my jacket i realized they didn ' t even do anything . we waited for an hour in the cold only to be rushed in and have our food thrown down at us and be rushed out . so i subtracted a dollar from my tip bringing it down to an admittedly bad tip of around N-N percent . after we left someone who wasn ' t our waiter ran up to my friend and i ( in front of the crowd of people waiting ) and said something about how the tip was too low and he showed me the bill . i asked him if there was anything on the receipt or menu about a mandatory tip and he said no but in new york you usually double the tax and leave atleast N-N percent . i should have went off on him about how i ' m from new york and the service sucked and i ' m within my right to leave a crappy tip but i was so shocked i just said no and i didn ' t think the service was good . he gave me an evil look and walked away . was i a jerk for leaving a bad tip , maybe , but i thought the service was bad and i ' m within my right to leave a bad tip . i don ' t go around leaving bad tips everywhere . i leave a standard tip of doubling the tax and rounding up and i leave even more if the service was great . if you are a waiter you should ask yourself why the person is leaving you a bad tip instead of going outside and hounding them down for a dollar . screw this place , the ramen is run of the mill and the employees are weirdos who don ' t understand the tipping system . also , i just read this place has a c rating in the other comments ! might not have even tried it if i knew that . maybe health inspectors don ' t like it when you are hauling in bags of eggs from the grocery store and dropping the cartons all on the floor . yes , i witnessed this while i was eating . if you read the other reviews here i think you ' ll find a pattern of poor hygiene and sanitation at this place . 
this place is great ! excellent food , bustling atmosphere , and friendly wait staff . the bread and whatever-it-is-that-they-give-you-to-dip-the- bread-in were the highlights of the meal , but our entrees were also very good . we will certainly be coming back . 
note to self return to eat both sides of menu . chicken panini was huge with freshly grilled fillet and guest had satisfying pasta bolognese leaving no room for dessert . a couple of blocks from the high line and near enough to grand central . nice atmosphere . 
food was good . . . . . service was horrible and will not be back anytime soon , as we were majorly dissapointed . 
my wife and i were looking for a new indian restaurant due to the closing of our neighborhood one . we found chanti through yelp reviews . upon arrival it looked like your average d cor for this type of establishment . we were then asked if we would like to be seated outside on their patio . that instantly made this a great experience for my wife . since we are new to indian food and my wife is vegetarian , we found the large selection of menu items to be wonderful . we both tried a dish we had not tried before and found them to be very good . the waiter was happy , friendly and well informed about the menu . we will surely be back on the patio trying some other new dishes soon . 
horrendous experience ! i saw a waiter in the restroom finish his business and go out without washing his hands . i asked him his name so i could complain to the management . he refused to tell me his name and to my surprise even his manager refused to tell me his name or reprimand him . we just left without finishing our dinner . disgusting ! whatever little food we ate was ok and not great compared to other choices in the parsippany morristown area . please stay away ! 
came here on a busy saturday night . just fyi , this restaurant does not take reservations . luckily , my date got there a little ahead of schedule and i was also running N minutes late , so we got seated as soon as i arrived . the restaurant was rather large , but was packed with couples and groups alike . it is definitely a great first date spot . the waitstaff was very attentive and we didn ' t have to wait too long for our orders . appetizer bruschetta ( tomato bread with fresh tomato , garlic , oregano ) came in N pieces and was very fresh . entrees spaghetti alla chitarra with fresh chop tomato , basil , mozzarella simple yet delicious . my date finished the whole plate in one second . spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce pillowy spinach goodness in a creamy sauce . however , it was very filling and i was only able to eat about half . will definitely be back again soon . 
juliana ' s serves the best caesar salad i ' ve had in a looong while . and the pizza is delicious - very similar to the pizza served at grimaldi ' s . 
went here with my lady prior to visiting my previous rating that a friend recommended . this place was great ! need i not say more . simply great ! 
we are in town for the weekend , and decided to eat breakfast here . we arrived at N am , and were seated by N . ordered pancakes , bacon , and morning potatoes . expect powdered sugar on your pancakes , which were good . morning potatoes had rosemary for a really good flavor , and the bacon was cooked perfectly . staff was great , food was good , and wait time was minimal . 
amazing . i am now a fan of alligator meat the bites were delicious . the staff was attentive , friendly , and professional . the chef is a genius there hasn ' t been one thing on the menu that i didn ' t like . their wings were my second favorite thing on the menu after the gator . they were mild to medium and crispy and not over-sauced . all the blue cheese they use is real blue cheese , not the dressing from a bottle , and its amazing . got seafood gone wild which i would recommend but the baby back ribs were fall-off-the-bone and delicious . went there two fridays in a row and will keep going back ! ! ! 
when i lived in the area back in the Ns to N , the food was the same . greasy , stale , bitter and hard , like it was stored there for more than a day . if we were lucky , we would get food free of roaches or hair . i gave them another chance when i moved , and nothing has changed . no roaches , but the taste of it is the same . it ' s not clean in there , nor is the food . unless you ' re starving and you don ' t care about it , eat there . the food is just drowning in grease , and it ' s made me sick to my stomach just eating here . 
great experience . . . excellent food and atmosphere . prices are very reasonable . the interior is quite large and spacey , which is a nice deviation from the typical crowded montclair restaurant experience . 
have been a million times , alway pretty yummy , great for happy hour , friendly staff , yummy food . yuca burger ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
went last sunday with my girlfriend . food was mediocre . we ordered off the " happy hour menu " she got a bloody mary and i got a couple beers . waitress was nice enough to add N for better vodka without asking my girlfriend . the waitress seemed upset when i asked about it and took off the N by applying the happy hour food specials we should have already received . we were in a little but of a hurry so i didn ' t really want to deal with complaining . we don ' t live in philly but have friends who do . there are just too many good bars in the area to choose macs tavern . 
i have patronized the ucity and the cherry hill mall locations several times . eat-in and take-out , i ' ve done it all . it ' s a decent place to meet up with friends for a casual meal of food . sometimes seating can be a bit tricky during lunch and dinner hours , but what do you expect ? one location is adjacent to a college campus the other in a mall . you order first then sit with your number until your food is brought to you . you can choose to sit at a table or take a seat at the counter . food-wise , i usually opt for the angus beef palace classic burger , but i ' m also fond of the crunchburger . i ' ve been crunch-ifying my sandwiches since elementary school . i also love the bbp fry dipping sauce that comes with the order of french fries . i wouldn ' t go so far to say that this is the best burger i ' ve had in my life , but definitely a solid option . 
rude , slow service waste of time do go there . been there N times always the same . 
great pizza and great service ! super busy and popular place but the line moves super quick and the food is well worth the wait . i highly recommend the chili or the chicken slice . 
my first trip to a chiles . went in the late afternoon . place was empty and we sat at the bar . jackie the bartender was not very friendly at all . she spent almost all the time in the kitchen . we had beer . they have the usual N on tap , blue moon by the adolph coors brewing company for us . enchiladas with green sauce . dry . flavorless . not spicy . burger . dry , flavorless . unseasoned . atmosphere ? dull . boring . would i ever come here again ? no f ' ing way . 
by far , the best sicilian pizza i ' ve ever tasted . 
i went there for lunch with a friend having read very mixed reviews of the place . many recommended the beer but not the food . well i thought i would give it a fair try in any case . don ' t waste your time or money on this place ! ! upon entering we waited near the hostess podium for about N minutes before anyone paid us any attention . there were N people sitting at the bar , a table of N and a table with N - so no reason to have slow service . we noticed one server and one bartender - it was only N . N pm on a sunday . being someone who loves different foods , i was really looking forward to a good german meal . we ordered a gulaschsuppe ( beef stew with potatoes in a red wine sauce ) and a kasseler ripchen ( smoked pork chop with sweet and sour red cabbage and a potato pancake ) . a female server took our order , but the food was brought to us ( in a timely manner ) by a male server . he had his thumb half way into the gravy of the gulasch and spilled about two spoons of it on the floor and table just before placing it in front of me . he didn ' t seem to care as he said oops and wiped it off with a paper towel . actually i was a little shocked that he didn ' t think that his thumb in my food was unacceptable and didn ' t know what to do at the moment . my friend ' s kr was mediocre and overpriced at N . my gulasch was tepid to warm at best and after i tasted it from as far away as possible from where the server had his thumb inserted into it , called the server and told her that it was too cold to eat . she said " no problem - we can heat that up for you " . really ! ! i think that is the least they could do . i did get another bowl N minutes later , which was just as cold as the first . i was having horror thoughts as to what was being done to my food when it went back to the kitchen . who knows . we left most of the food on the plate and decided to cut short our lunch . we paid our check in cash and the server came back with plenty of notes in change , but decided to round up the bill and didn ' t bring back N cents . of course i know it is only N cents , but from when is it the right of any business to round up a customers check . i highly recommend not going to this place , what a waste to time , money and a nice afternoon when there are so many other nice places to go eat in philly ! 
how much longer till it is due to open ? i miss having a bar on my corner that i can easily walk to . also , i never had a harassment problem there . i mean it was a dive bar but as long as i put my foot down i never had an issue . 
why yes , i do believe calle ocho is as good as it gets . they have an amazing selection of sangria , my favorite is their red fresca sangria , a pitcher of that will make almost anyone a happy camper . to raise the ante even more , their all-you-can-drink sangria brunch renders all other brunches to be incomparable , it ' s almost unfair , but no one ' s complaining . for the other vegetarians , despite calle ocho being a latin american restaurant , they have the most tasty dish of wild mushroom paella , conveniently called " vegetariano , " and adding sour cream to it makes it all the more glorious . my meat-loving friend ordered the chicken quesadillas for brunch , but could not stop eying my paella and ordered it for herself the next time , so it ' s that good . i also am very fond of their fried calamari , which has more a tangy and nutty thai flavor to it - i highly recommend it . i guess the only downside ( applies for brunch only , not so much for dinner ) is you would have to make brunch reservations weeks in advance if you want a chance of getting in on the all-you-can drink sangria , but almost any and all consequences are worth getting a table in this case . 
i can ' t really say anything new that hasn ' t been expressed by over N other yelpers , but i ' m glad i came . i was nervous when one reviewer said he got sick every time he came . ( and yet he kept eating there ) i had a much better experience , so as part of my macdougal food crawl , i sampled a little of everything with the meat combo shawarma , falafel , baba , and hummus . they ' re open until Nam , which assures me i can have satisfy my falafel craving at any time . the falafels are excellent- not overrated , not fried in old oil , hot , crispy , and fresh . the pita is warm and doughy . the baba is chunky and tasted like it was just made . good hummus with tahini too . i wasn ' t loving the shawarma though- i got a lot of darker crispy ends , but i wasn ' t bothered because i had plenty of baba and hummus to keep my belly happy . i came in at about Nam and there were about N people in front of me . when i left , several drunk and happy girls were eyeing my table vulture style and hungry people were filed out the door . room for improvement- they could ' ve used a heater in the seating area , but i guess they don ' t want us to linger too long ! 
i ' ll keep this short and sweet , the experience was out of this world . loved it from the shot of soup they started us with to the check , honestly ! we were a party of two and decided to treat ourselves on a thursday evening . made reservations and went to the restaurant , small , cozy and hidden . we ordered four plates , the shrimp ( spicy , tasty , flavorful with yam and pineapple ) , the scallops over lentil , so good , pork belly , another delicious dish and the beet and goat cheese , my least favorite because of the goat cheese , but it ' s my taste , also not " beet-y " enough for me . we had to order the bacon donut dessert and coffee ice cream . and it was my first time having bacon in my dessert , and now i just realized how much i ' ve missed ! ! they gave us a cube of watermelon , tiny but sweet , and really just a great way to end the meal . we ended up being very full , paying N a person , and for that experience , i think it was well worth it . that was last week , and i ' m going back with more friends this week ! ! 
aroma is the best best , we came away from aroma thai feeling full and satisfied . our lunching experience turned out to be very delicious . it ' s exactly what we ' d expect , i ' m sure we ' ll return to aroma i ' ve never seen a thai restaurant ' s menu like aroma grace latino
mmg of parsippany is excellent ! ! service is spot on and the food is a great healthy alternative to the burger joints and pizza places that are the affordable food choices in the area . i highly recommend it ! 
a great place to grab late night breakfast ! the wait is never long for your food . ( especially late nights ) their buffalo chicken wrap is delicious as well and a nice change up from breakfast ! pretty big portions here so share with a friend if you ' re not starving ! 
great for causal mingle
the waiter was extremely rude . 
i want to start off by saying i usually come here for sunday brunch which is wonderful , read my last review for the sunday brunch . this time we decided to try the happy hour . ambiance was nice , it was dark with a small bar with minimal amount of tables around the outside of the room . they really should add a couple tables in the middle to accomodate more people . the place was full but it didn ' t take much to make it full as i said there were minimal tables and the bar was small . they have a short wine list for N a glass . other happy hours in the area offer a more extensive happy hour wine list so this was a disappointment . i had the chicken , crab and sausage quesadilla which was made fresh and delicious . . . more than i expected for a appetizer at happy hour . overall , its a nice quiet place to sit and have a drink and an app . if you ' re looking for a more happening place , this is not it . . . they would need to market it a little better , add some more tables and add more to their happy hour menu to attract more people . to the management i do really like the restaurant though , so if you ever do that , please let me know ! 
i love these empanadas . they have such a variety . i wish i could come here more often ( cant i ' m watching my weight ) . 
really freaking tasty . and cheap also . my favorites are -shredded chicken ( most people would think it ' s dry but i think it ' s great for an empanada . also good with the red sauce ) -pernil ( roast pork ) -spicy chicken ( definitely a good one ) -cuban ( ugh , just amazing ) -mambo italiano ( i ' m not a big fan of juicy empanadas - i like more dry meat but this one is really good ) i ' ve also had the viagra and i thought i ' d love it but for some reason , i ' m not a big fan . empanadas from here are my new addiction for now . it used to be vivi ' s popcorn chicken but every time i think about popcorn chicken , i taste vomit . oh and delivery is very quick and fresh with a N minimum . 
great italian food , fast and friendly service and the best meatballs i have ever had ! ! ! ! 
great space , excellent service , great food , good wine . i had dinner here with an old friend that i hadn ' t seen in a few years , and it was nice catching up in such an intimate setting with great food . we ordered the five course menu first course fluke sashimi , also referred to as hirame at sushi bars . great , light acid on it , along with a few pearls of roe . second course little gem salad with roasted vegetables . one of my favorites of the night . the zucchini in the vegetables had a flavorful char on them , and the little gems did well with the vinaigrette . third course scallops and chickpeas . my least favorite dish , but still well prepared and seasoned . scallops were flaky , not hard . sauce was unnecessary and distracting . fourth course short ribs . there were excellent , as they were totally falling apart and the wine reduction on them was delicious . al a carte add on foie . i was here about four days before the california foie ban went into effect , so i felt like i had to eat some before i came home to the bay area . great job here . fifth course chocolate ganache and berries . well done , but nothing special . overall , the meal was fantastic , with only the scallops and dessert rating a " meh " from me , but even those were pretty good . i am also probably biased towards this restaurant because the chef is a hapa , just like me . so there ' s that . 
very very nice place . the staff was very friendly and you can see the teamwork in place . food was delicious and price was not bad at all . i had cheese and mushroom ravioli and it was so good that i cleaned the plate although i wasn ' t that hungry . service and great so this place deserve N stars ! thank you yelp for helping me find this place
i ' ve come here numerous times with clients and could not be happier with the speed of the food and service . i highly recommend this location for excellent food served quickly by a very friendly wait staff . 
had the twoNtwo burger and enjoyed it . it was juicy and the bun , though wimpy , was good . everything else needs work . the burger didn ' t come with lettuce and tomato or pickles . apparently you need to ask . and the fries are extra . the N dollar " greek fries " are ill conceived . the feta simply falls off , so you ' re left with fries and side of crumbled cheese . my waiter was " not a beer person " so he wasn ' t able to point us in the direction of a tasty beer . if you ' re a waiter at a burger and beer joint and you don ' t like beer , at least pick the brain of someone who does and get informed . the decor of the bar is great and the staff is pleasant . and they have the most important thing , the burger , down . there is room for the place to improve . but unless they actually do improve , i wouldn ' t recommend . 
last friday i was headed to e v for dinner , they were closed for labor day weekend ! i was a bit annoyed then my date suggested nicola ' s . after a bit of search i found nicola ' s . this is an attractive place in a half empty strip mall . the staff was very attentive and fast to serve . the caponata ( eggplant ) and bruschetta and cheese and salami that they brought to the table was a nice touch while you read the menu . the caponata was excellent . started with a salad all ingredients extreme fresh and seasoned and dressed properly . i had the zuppa di peces it was pricy ( N . N ) but had a small lobster tail , large scallops and jumbo shrimps so only the best ingredients were used to prepare my meal and i appreciate that . i finished the meal with the home made taramisu and it was very good . everything was well done and if i must say a negative the coffee was weak lol this was a wonderful find and i will return . btw there is a wine bar in this strip mall where you can purchase a bottle if you want to have wine with your meal . 
outstanding ! my cousin and i came here on a sunday morning before heading back from burlington . get here early if you don ' t want to wait . when we arrived at N N about half the tables were full and we were able to be seated right away . by N N all the tables and most of the counter was full and people were waiting to be seated . coffee was offered right away and refills were made available through out our service . based on some of the reviews we started with the banana bread . it is one large slice of griddle toasted bread served with a maple walnut cream cheese and it is outstanding ! moist and dense but not heavy . it is not overly sweet and is delicious with or without the cream cheese . one slice is a nice appetizer for two . one of the specials was a zucchini bread french toast with a honey ricotta topping . i ordered that i was thrilled . it doesn ' t have the same texture as regular french toast but the flavor is great and the bread takes the egg coating well . the ricotta topping added a little sweetness but the orange zest in it gave it a nice brightness . the maple walnut cream cheese from the banana bread was so good that i added some to the french toast and it tasted just as good . i also order a homemade pork sausage link on the side . it was split grilled so it was crispy on both sides and the pork tasted fresh and meaty . it ' s one one of the few times i ' ve had breakfast sausage that didn ' t just taste like salt . my cousin ordered the big breakfast platter which comes with two pancakes , a meat ( bacon ) and two eggs . the pancakes were very tasty and light . the bacon was well cooked but actually needed more saltiness . it was tasty and thick . the portions sizes were bigger than i expected and i found the prices to be very reasonable for the amount , quality , and creativity of the food . with tax and tip breakfast was N for two . that was with the addition of banana bread as an appetizer and a side of sausage . if you skip the add-ons and stick with coffee , two people can eat for less than N . but i would recommend spending the extra money especially for the banana bread . go here and go early . but if you have to wait it is still worth it ! 
i never , ever eat chinese food in nj . if i want chinese i make to trek to nyc and head to mott cannal st . to wo hop . . . . . the best . i thought all chinese food in nj was all the same . . . . . . just plain bad . wow , was i ever wrong . i stumbled onto yao ' s and will never make the long trip to nyc . the food here is beyond outstanding ! ! ! i could care less about price . " cheap food in never cheap " a quick look at the prices on the menu and the are far less than then the rest . everything on the menu that we have had is simply put . . . . the best ! last week my wife wanted to know where i wanted to go for my birthday dinner . . . . nyc , philly , ac , northern nj to a nice steakhouse ? ? ? no way , my choice was yao ' s . the staff is family and ping our waiter get a N ouft a N rating ! how lucky we are that we live just N mile away ! 
my husband and i took our N kids to new york for the day to see the christmas displays . the streets were jam packed and trying to find a reasonable restaurant that was kid friendly would be unlikely . we parked on Nth st . and just trying to avoid the crowd we turned on Nth to find a place to eat . that is where we found tina ' s and i sent my husband inside to look around . he came out shaking his head saying , " it smells really good in there . " so , we brought the troops inside and sat in the back where they have tables set up for service . the menu looked scrumptous , and myself along with my husband and my mom ordered the shredded beef stew . my kids had chicken soup , breaded chicken , and the fried fish . everything was so delicious , well portioned and very reasonably priced . 
fantastic food ! great ambiance ! great service ! byob . . . what else can you ask for ? we loved it ! 
i love this place . the coffee is okay ( not the best but gets the job done ) , and the vegan cowboy cookies are amazing . feel around for a soft one , but they are otherwise perfect - you won ' t miss the eggs and butter , i promise you . i also got one of their sandwiches the other day . i am not sure which one it was , but it had the motz , red onions , and basil . the bagel was fresh and the perfect about the cheese and sauce . the place is a little small and cramped but we got a nice spot out front . oh and this is cute - they give you a hershey ' s kiss with your coffee . this is a must stop if you are looking for coffee shop noshes in the italian market . 
this is truly a hidden jewel ! in staten island . my night started out trying to get into beso ( N min wait ) then went to enoteca ( crowded and no one even approached me ) drove down to vida . . no wait food was delicious , from the hanger steak to the coconut shrimp . they know what they are doing here . and the sangria is a must . would love to keep this a hidden jewel a secret but everyone must try vida . i will be back ! ! 
i love the star ! such a nice brunch spot for me and my ladies . none of us have ever had a bad dish . the best thing on my menu in my opinion is the meatloaf sandwich . so good . you can ' t really go wrong with anything though . it can get a lil hectic for brunch , but that ' s the norm in williamsburg really . 
apparently things have changed here - a lot - since my last visit . i went twice in one week and loved the food . the scallops were fantastic , perfectly cooked with a delicious sauce , and the brussel sprouts with bacon were delicious . then i took my fiance back there for the lobster fest - i think it was N for N courses - really good . lobster slider app was great , they had N choices for lobster entrees ( N were split with different seasonings , N whole or lobster mac and cheese ) , and dessert . we ate in the bar area so were able to take advantage of the great martini specials at happy hour . and both times the service was fantastic - so a big difference from my first visit . can ' t want to go back ! 
this is absolutely one of the worst if not worst places to eat on church street . they serve nothing local , nothing organic . it ' s quite embarrassing having this business on church street with so many tourist unknowingly eating at such a horrible place . bugs are prevalent in the basement bathroom . gross place , no class , and terribly salt food . 
bubby ' s has been a great lunch spot that i frequent for special occasions only . why only on special occasions ? pros great food in large portions , and usually kinda fattening . great atmosphere too , and super nice waiters who are almost too enthusiastic hehe . also , their menu changes pretty often . cons not outright expensive , but the food is pricier than i am used to , although it is justified by the large portions . recommendations gazpacho , veggie chili ( its really spicy though ) , any kind of fettucine , bubby ' s burger , and my favorite-the monte cristo ( a weird combination sandwich of authentic thick cuts of ham , cheese , berry jam , all on thick slices of french toast sprinkled with powdered sugar-its so delicious and unique ) . all their sides were great as well , especially the mashed potatoes and fried okra . drinks are great too ! i highly recommend their sodas , which are made to order . the lemon cucumber soda is worth trying and i doubt you ' ll find it anywhere else . desserts all of them are good and have unique names . i ' ve had the grasshopper pie ( its mint , with chocolate lacings on the surface , so no grasshoppers harmed in its making lols ) and the organic peanut butter chocolate pie . their apple pie is to die for . everything-from the first to last course , was so good ) they have not disappointed me yet ) again , the portions are huge , and i usually only manage to eat half of my entree . they ' re also super flexible with the bill and can charge it on multiple cards if you ' re planning to go dutch . also heard that it ' s a celebrity haunt but the times i go there , i seem to be the only customer in the house ) haven ' t seen too much other diners . 
perilla has been on my " list " for a while , it didn ' t disappoint ! we started with the legendary duck meatballs , which didn ' t disappoint , the crispy calamari salad which was was bursting with flavor and texturally indescribable . we shared the roasted hake the hanger steak , both were so good we didn ' t want to trade ! and we planned on sharing one dessert but were convinced by our waiter to share two ( not the we objected ! ) chocolate souffl is chocolate souffl but it was undeniably great , and we had the take five sundae , which is the only thing that didn ' t wow me , i thought it was aggressively salty . lovely gracious staff spectacular memorable meal ! i can ' t wait to go back ! 
ate here for restaurant week lunch . overall , it was just okay . i wouldn ' t really go back again because like what others have said , this is standard american food . i had the beet salad , striped bass , and the panna cotta for dessert . i like pickled beets and the dressing and greens for the salad were well done . the striped bass was cooked quite perfectly , and the sauce was delicious , as was the polenta cake underneath . the panna cotta was standard . however , overall , it was just okay because although they cooked the food well , it just wasn ' t that different from other local organic seasonal meals i ' ve had . it ' s odd that the server made such a big deal about it when we were seated . also , the host was scattered-- we had reservations and he said he would " set up the table . " the restaurant was less than N full and we waited for N minutes for a table , while he sat a group that came in after us , immediately . he didn ' t even acknowledge the gaffe that he made . 
i just really had a great time here for happy hour . mind you , i almost always eat alone so when i say i had a great time i am having it by myself . i didn ' t talk to anyone ( except the servers ) but it was so enjoyable . the service was amazing , and the happy hour food was fantastic . i had oysters and salt cod . i will make the trek from brooklyn to manhattan regularly for this happy hour . 
i was at the yellow plum last friday and i had a fabulous experience . we tried the lobster bologenese and the skirt steak . both were amazing ! our server veronica was wonderful . the speciaialty cocktails ( yellow plum highland high noon ) we had were delicious ! everyone has to try yellow plum ! it was one of the best fine dining experiences we have had in the bloomfield area . we will be making this our regular dining spot ! 
amazing paris inn the ' best " ! ! i can ' t say enough great things about paris inn for my husband Nth birthday . starting off with the planning process , they are so attentive and helpful ( and patient ) i drove myself crazy cannot imagine how they dealt with me ! stephanie helped me plan everything from the food to the floor plan to the overall flow of my day . the day of the party went so smooth with tony and his father making sure that everything was falling into place and that we were relaxed and having the fun . now onto the food . . . incredible ! ! i really wanted to provide our guests with a delicious culinary experience and paris inn delivered that above and beyond . we got countless compliments on the food and service staff . everything was perfect . i don ' t know how they did it , but they did . so impressed and happy , paris family , pepe and i have been your happy customers for long time and plan to be with you Never thank you ! ! ! aleksandra and pepe chico sept N
if you ' re like most new yorkers , the weekend only means one thing brunch . but not just any ol ' brunch . because if you ' re a real new yorker , your run of the mill greek diner won ' t do . if you ' re a real new yorker , brunch is a place to see and be seen . a place where the mimosas and bloody mary ' s flow from large bottomless pitchers . a place where you can walk in at noon and walk out at N . and not to mention , if you ' re a real new yorker , it ' s a place where they don ' t accept reservations and there ' s a minimum wait of N hour . ( good food helps too , but i ' m convinced not as much as the other factors . ) to me , clinton st . baking company ( csbc ) is the new yorker ' s quintessential brunch place . my interest was piqued about csbc a couple of years ago , after hearing about its notorious " N to N hour wait times , " but i really couldn ' t see myself making that kind of investment for eggs and waffles . then bobby flay had to go and really mess things up by doing a throwdown ! with the owner to see who could make the best blueberry pancakes . ( bobby won , btw . ) not to mention that new york magazine previously voted csbc ' s blueberry pancakes the best in nyc and time out new york voted csbc the best place for brunch . now , let me say that i prefer savory foods to sweet any day of the year , but i have a weakness for blueberry pancakes . and after all the hype , how could i not want to ( need to ) try csbs ' s signature dish drizzled in warm maple butter ? luckily my boyfriend felt the same way and surprised me with a saturday afternoon brunch trip to the lower east side . we immediately recognized the place by the congregation of people waiting outside for their names to be called ( secretly praying the person before them in line hadn ' t come back yet . ) we put our name down and went for a drink around the corner . about an hour later , we returned to the line and i found myself joining the masses , rejoicing every time the host called a name that didn ' t illicit a response . i think we waited a little over an hour in total to be seated , which was awesome ( considering the rumors ) . and when i walked in , i was really surprised at how plain-jane their quaint , little N-seat restaurant was . it looked your run of the mill coffee shop . but they definitely don ' t serve your run of the mill food , and don ' t offer your run of the mill prices . my order was obvious , the blueberry pancakes . mike ordered the southern breakfast ( two eggs any style , sugar-cured bacon , cheese grits , and fried green tomatoes ) . we also got an order of biscuits and bloody mary ' s . fifteen minutes after ordering , our waitress came by and admitted she forgot to put our order in and asked us what we wanted again . she assured us it would be quick and that the biscuits would be out in no time . i don ' t know why , but this really peeved me . this place has a reputation , a N hour wait , they only accept cash , they compete with bobby flay , they have the " best breakfast " in town , and you mean to tell me their waitress " forgot " to put our order in ? not acceptable . luckily for her , the food was delicious . the homemade biscuits came out quickly , as promised , and they were piping hot . each biscuit was the size of a softball and perfectly golden brown . the thick shards of dough crumbled off easily and were so flavorful that they didn ' t need any additional butter ( or the raspberry jam they serve with them , for that matter ) . my pancakes also came piping hot , but i was disappointed with the blueberry sauce they glopped on the top of the stack . luckily the pancakes were massive , so i put the first one to the side and dug in to the remaining two . there was a high blueberry to pancake ratio , which was a bit overwhelming for me . but the consistency of the pancakes was on point . fluffy and moist . i don ' t typically use syrup on my pancakes , just butter , but i did try their warm maple butter on a couple of pieces . it was good , just a bit too sweet for my taste . mike enjoyed his eggs , but the winner on his plate was the cheese grits . i can ' t really describe what they tasted like , but if you like cheese and you like cooked cornmeal ( and even if you don ' t ) , you ' ll be in heaven . so , all in all , the blueberry pancakes were good . that ' s all i can say . good . have i had better ? yes . in new york ? yes . would i wait an hour for these blueberry pancakes again ? no . but i probably would wait an hour for those enormous biscuits and cheese grits again . 
 like it so much . it is the restaurant that i must go when going to philadelphia . 
i ' ve tried both the pulled pork and the israeli egg sandwich with eggplant . both were ridiculously good . 
this is really american kind of restaurant . food is pretty good . my boyfriend loves the stake here and i love their salads . prices are pretty friendly as well as their staff . beer selection is good and it is really good place for relaxing and watching some sports on the tv , while eating good food . we need more places like this on r . i . we will come again . 
i dream about grimaldi ' s pies . the best pizza i ' ve had yet . then again , i ' m from san diego , so even the microwaved slices from the joints on times square are better than most of the stuff they pass off as pizza out here . we didn ' t wait too long to be seated . N minutes ? despite the fact we were sandwiched between the window a young couple on their second date and the the waitstaff getting annoyed with us for being indecisive , it was a wonderful and delicious experience . 
i wish i could give this place more stars . unbelievable food that is virtually never ending . the family is lovely , sweet and fun . each dish is better then the last and after tasting the first few courses you ' ll think that ' s not possible , but oh it is ! bring your own drink of choice and have your next special dinner with the family at N fox place . 
this is my favorite greek restaurant on ditmars . my favorite is the grill squid and shrimp . only thing is that me and my girlfriend wait for almost an hour , and was quickly rush by the waiter to pay the bills . 
went back to briciola last night , and again , i give it a N stars . food , staff , wine selection , everything is there to make you smile . amazing spot ! ! ! ! 
robyn , the bartender , is the best ! ! i only come here for her ! it ' s a great deal for brunch , too , if your idea of brunch is leaving wasted . which , let ' s be real . it is . 
no wonder the chef was a runner-up , but i ' m surprised he was even on tv with such lousy overall service , ambiance and food . the restaurant is tiny , maybe N square feet and the tables are communal , so be prepared to squash yourself into an uncomfortable seat . the staff is horrible , they clearly hate their job and seem to hate each other as well . they also move with the urgency of slugs . now , the food is really amazingly overpriced . the scallop dish is once large scallop sliced into N pieces served with slivers of a pita . the burger is N small sliders . skate wing is about N ounces of fish and over oily greens on top . the pork buns were ok , but i was shocked that they served cherry chutney on the side and warned us about being careful that the pits were still in there . how could you leave a choking and tooth hazard in the food ? the chefs couldn ' t even take the time to take the cherry pits out ? all the dishes i just mentioned were tiny and between N-N . def not worth the overall experience and the tiny portions that were mediocre . 
having eaten here at least a dozen times in the past twelve months , this is my goto place on a cold or rainy day . nothing feels as good as a hearty beef broth with chili oil and noodles . i ' m a huge fan of their shanghai noodles with tender beef and big wontons . in fact , i think it ' s the best chinese beef noodles i ' ve had in the city . the wonton are the size of large dumplings and the beef is tender and full of flavor . the other dishes served here are fine , but the star attraction will always be the beef noodles . my only gripe with the restaurant is the wait staff . inattentive , lazy and depressing no wonder they wear colorful hawaiian shirts to even out their sour attitudes . a note to those that ' s been going to wonton garden ' s for a while . you might notice that their noodle soup bowls for have gotten smaller . it ' s still more than enough to stuff you , but it definitely less than before . 
cute space . spacious and good for large brunch parties . the free buttermilk biscuits with apple jam are amazing ! i ' ve been here twice in a year which is saying a lot for a ny restaurant ! 
tangent i berated my roommate the other day for not knowing that old rock song " peaches come in a can . . . they were put their by a man . . . " which are just absurd lyrics . . . on topic this place has amazing fried chicken which we managed to snag at a good deal through the N course dine in bk offer . you can ' t go wrong with the classic iceberg bacon blue cheese salad , the hot and extra hot chicken which has amazing skin that falls off the bone juicy meat and the simple banana pudding , nilla wafer dessert . we also knocked back a few mudslide ( ? ) and sister rosetta drinks . i would come here every week if i could . 
love the entire dining experience especially the tofu stew ! i am a big fan of bcd tofu house ever since before they relocated here . they were down the street on the same street . best tofu stew in korean town for sure ! this particular location have a lot of traffic - there is almost always a wait time line . you walk in and ask for a table for your party . they will then hand you a buzzer . the furthest i have been with the buzzer was outside ( though , i am tempted to test how far i can go with it ) . my review for food is the same in my bayside review yelp . com biz bcd-tofu-ho overall , a very good experience every time i come here , however , the bayside - queens location is my favorite . 
ordinary is a good place for a fancier kind of drink . i really like the rum and roots drink , which is rum with dandelion and burdock soda . it ' s pretty delicious . the cocktails are typically pretty strong and although it ' s kind of pricy , it ' s not crazy . it can be very crowded , but it ' s the kind of place where you don ' t mind ( see next sentence ) . tip for the ladies there are always attractive young professional men at ordinary , just sayin ' . 
i love natty mechanics . it is such a large and garish spot , that it ' s funny to me that i often overlook it when trying to think of a quick spot to get beer and grub . the interior is absolutely excellent . i ' m particularly fond of the oddities and other unusual decor . plus , i ' m a big fan of the community-style seating . the staff is always super-friendly and very attentive . and the food granted , i rarely order other things than the veggie burger ( which is one of the best in the city ) , but i ' ve never had anything that i didn ' t like . ( except last night i had a side salad instead of fries and the balsamic dressing was just " off " - no other way to describe it . ) also , i ' m always supremely happy with the draft beer selection . 
hillstone is a quiet little gem of a place tucked in park ave south . it is slowly becoming my new favorite ! usually i am not into sushi , but due to some pushing from a friend i ended up getting some california rolls with some lovely kale on the side . everything was perfect , from the service to the drinks to the end of the meal-which i finished with a dark and stormy , which was equally good . will be back here again-soon ! 
the guy at salumeria helped me find a great , semi-soft sheep cheese similar to one i ' d had in nyc . i ' d tried to get something similar from downtown , where i usually go , but they didn ' t have it and didn ' t offer a substitute . it ' s sad . . . i have divided loyalties now ( with dibruno ' s thrown in ) , but i ' m interested in customer service , selection and having idiazabal when i want it . 
i love this place . it cheap and delicious . 
a hole in the wall and very unassuming , but by far the best peruvian that i ' ve had so far in nyc . that ' s coming from taste-buds that ate peruvian for N years as a child . it definitely brings back childhood memories . 
can in for lunch with a business associate . ordered the empanadas and fish tacos . the empanadas were quite good , with homemade dough and lightly fried . i liked both the beef and the spinach and goat cheese . the spinach was tender and garlicky and the beef had a hint of spice . they also came with a tasty aioli . the tacos came in small , round , crispy shells topped with corn salsa , avocado and a citrus dressing . the fish was light , tender and not over seasoned . my colleague had the ropa vieja and reported that it was excellent . would like to return for dinner or more tapas . recommended . 
very cool scene . great looking crowd spinach and aritichoke dip was to die for
sushi cafe makes some of the best rolls in nj . i make a weekly trip to see paul even if it ' s just for lunch or a snack . can ' t speak to the sashimi or the other dishes , but everything looks fresh . they do get crowded , but it ' s byo so easy to pass the time . 
been here N times and i ' ve eaten around the menu and tried some specials . good news excellent food - really excellent . i ' ve been to new orleans and this stacks up . the ribs are the best i ' ve had in nyc , as is the red beans and rice . a couple of the chicken dishes i tried are serious revelations , and the drinks and desserts are just as good - not trucked-in afterthoughts like at other places . ( not to dump on my adopted borough , but there ' s a lot of care and delicacy to their stuff which is lacking in most si restaurants . ) the portions are huge which just means yummy leftovers . it ' s not cheap , but in terms of value , it ' s exceptional . waitstaff is very friendly and professional . bad news kitchen is too small . no , i ' m not an interior designer , but this is the only conclusion i can come to . the waiters hustle their asses off but if you go on a busy night ( most nights i ' ve been there ) it can take over N . N hours just to get through a N-course meal . once i clocked a full hour between appetizers and main courses . too many tables for the size of the kitchen . we only go very early now , which is a drag because most of the time that ' s inconvenient . get the food out quicker and i ' d give a fifth star without hesitation . seriously - this is a great place . 
sat at the bar there were N bartenders and N customers and still could not get service without asking N times got the calamari and mussels and both were horrible ! overpriced more of a old age pick up place ! 
it ' s your classic college bar . dimly lit with boozed-up co-ed ' s . i try to avoid " dollar drafts " night because they serve flat beer that could be colder . but if you are a college student in burlington , you must have an " i always go to what ' s ale ' s " phase . 
i really like going to pepes whenever i am in new haven . the pizza is great and totally worth the wait . you cannot go wrong with the house suggestions and the pizza comes out cooked perfectly and nice and hot . order a few pies and a pitcher of beer and you will have a great time ! 
my experience of the food here has always been pretty good - i would say a solid three or four stars . however , even compared to the other nearby places in chinatown , the hygiene is so bad that i cannot return . ( i did return , many times , until finally i had had enough such experiences . ) on one occasion friends of mine that had finished a meal there with me took home their leftovers in a paper bag , and on returning home , opened the bag to have three large cockroaches immediately escape from it into their apartment . on at least four other occasions , myself or my friends have suffered short-term stomach illness from the food here in the hours immediately after eating . so although the food is honestly very good , and i would often like to return , i can no longer find anyone to go with me to risk those statistics . 
we ' ve been here a few times now . once on nye for a beer and snack before the fireworks . . . and again last night . both times we got the moules . . . two different flavors . . . both were delicious ( dijon and beer ) . we look forward to working our way through the other N flavors on future visits ! the belgian frietjes and fish and chips are also wonderful . both visits we sat at the bar . bartenders are super friendly and attentive . . . checking in and filling water often . and speaking of bar . . . this place has a crazy huge menu of beers . you have to order a beer to drink while you are reviewing the menu because it will take you that long to get through . . . so fun . 
touristy . pricey . over-hyped . crowded . that being said it does have some positives . it ' s an interesting vibe , has some decent eateries , the deli is excellent . some of the salamis and meats are really excellent and hard to find elsewhere . spent a nice evening drinking barolo with a selection of cheeses and honey . the rooftop bar is a cool place to hang at dusk . go at off hours to appreciate it without the crowds -- much more enjoyable . 
decent happy hour on draft beers , lovely irish bar staff and a cosy dive atmosphere . N N
food is top notch . i came here when it first opened and couldn ' t be more impressed . i ' ll be back many times , maybe even bring a date . 
uhh , talk about over hyped pizza . so glad they have a take-out section because they told me that the wait for N people around Npm on a monday night was an hour . i would have been sorely disappointed if i waited an hour for this . got the margherita and the famous original . both came out to be N . to get the best experience , we actually ate the pies as soon as we received them and it was just okay--it ' s nothing i haven ' t tried before , nothing that was mind-blowing , not that memorable other than the burnt bubbles along the crust . i dunno . why does this place have crazy good ratings ? did i order something wrong ? 
turkey burgers are phe-nom-enal
grilled long island duck was incredible . kamameshi with snow crab was pretty lovely , too . quite expensive , but definitely worth it for a special evening . will be back , and will sit in the front next time ! 
the only decent korean restaurant in connecticut . 
best halal cart food in nyc . service is friendly . prices are ok , wish they were a bit lower . ( says the guy who spends N bucks on a latte ) 
amazing how many healthy and tasty options they have , and at a decent price . not to mention , i loved the comfortable , beautiful , artistic interior design of the restaurant . and the servers are so cheerful and helpful ! definitely a great place if you appreciate health food ! 
seriously . . . i live in astoria and i always think about trying some of the other amazing restaurants in the area , but i already know they won ' t be as good as bambino . friendly service , great atmosphere , and most importantly -- amazing food . better to go in person and not get the delivery . delivery food isn ' t bad but the paninis are best straight off the press . 
typical chinese joint . nothing bad . nothing great . prices are good though i get the combo platters . 
amazing ! hidden below froyoworld this place is a must for lunch . so many different sandwiches to choose from and they use only the best products . from boars head to great coffee take a break from school and head over here . 
this wonderful establishment is located in old city . pros -the decor in the place freaking rocks ! even the ceiling is decorated . the walls have all these vintage lucha libre pictures or masks hanging with a theme that is sort of " day of the dead " . -the service is fast and friendly -there are many types of seating booth , outdoor , and tables with high chairs , don ' t forget actual bar seating -full bar and beers on tap -sweet latin music blaring through the speakers -ordered a chicken quesadilla dinner plate and it was awesome cons -michaleda wasn ' t that great ( -their chips and salsa aren ' t free ? ! not cool
this place is pretty pricy but the macaroons are the best i ' ve ever had . so many flavors i still yet have to return for more . my sister in law bought me a variety pack and i got to try several flavors . so far the salted caramel and vanilla are my favorites . amazing flavor , texture . . so soft and light ) 
had some sliders . tried the beef , spicy pork , chicken and vegetable ones . my favorite was the beef . i like how you can make different combinations . thumbs up . 
try the grits ! ! ! they ' re so good ! . food here is great , atmosphere is cool too . good beer on tap . 
being vegetarian is never easy in non-vegetarian fast food restaurants . i have tried the two vegetarian warps , falafel and once bitten . the falafel is good the once bitten is de-li-ci-ous , the sauce , the vegetables and the warp , all fresh and tasty . wolfnights is a great addition in the lower east side . 
ok , i am not sure if this is a new food truck , but it seems to have a lot of potential . sambas cuisine serves brazilian spanish food . i am neither so i cannot attest to the authenticity . i bought the friday special of brazilian bbq . it came with beef , grilled sausage ( linguisa ? ) , rice and black beans , potato salad , and a small bit of green salad . the beef and sausage were very tasty . the beef was a little hard to cut with plastic ware in a foam take-out container , but it was tasty and was easy to eat . the sausage was very good . the rice and black beans had an odd " coffee " or burnt flavor to them . there were bones in my beans , so i assume stewed homemade . the rice was a little crunchy or uncooked , which bothered me a little . the potato salad was very tasty . mayo based but it had fresh green beans , peas , carrots , and some other bean . all of it was tasty . the mayo was not overwhelming . the vegetables must have been parboiled because they were firm but not raw . the salad could have been a little bigger . it was about three bites of mixed greens . but it was fresh and crisp . it came with a small container of something that looks like ground nuts or bread crumbs . i will need someone to explain that one to me . i will go back . i feel like i got N worth of food . it was very filling and tasty . i will try to remember to grab a menu and post it . 
this is a great neighborhood bar in a hipster neighborhood . great ambiance , decent wine , pretty good food . the service on the night we went was spotty at best - many of the workers were hanging at the very back bar and could have been more attentive to the few patrons in the place . music could also be dialed down a bit . not a place i would go to specifically for the food - philly has too many great restaurants for that - it was just convenient for the night we went . more of a hang out place with friends - for drinking and socializing . 
i have lived in the upper valley now for awhile , one of my new friends in town told me about cantore ' s pizza , mentioning that they have gluten free pizza . i was so excited to try their pizza and loved it so much that i went two days in a row . since going gluten free i have really missed a good pizza . this tastes homemade , with fresh toppings . my husband isn ' t gluten free and loves their calzones . i recommend their pizza to everyone ! 
it ' s a bar with awesome bar food , great burgers and addictive onion rings . but why , oh why is it so far away from the subway . it ' s great for the locals however , and i love the fact they have hooks underneath the bar so that you can hang your items . great atmosphere for the tipsy and the minglers . 
first time at brcelonas and i loved it ! love the small plate selection we ordered N dishes and a cheese plate all were so good ! unfortunately they never brought out our last dish ( lobster and fried pasta ) but the waitress was nice enough to take it off the bill and wrap it up to go , which i thought was more then generous ! we will be returning soon ! 
pros - pizza ! fresh ingredients . cooked in a coal burning oven . the smell is aromatic . we had riccota , olives , mushrooms , pepperori , and italian sausage . ended up getting a Nnd pie because the Nst was so good . cons - long , long , long wait , but its worth it . warning , dont eat too much otherwise you kill that good sensation of eating a great pizza . this is the best ny in ny . its too bad the walk from the brooklyn bridge is so long . maybe they can build a stairway that drops you down instead of walking all the way to the end of the bridge . 
i am vegan and always find delicious options at siggy ' s . they have quick delivery but it is also a cute ( affordable ) place to sit in for breakfast , lunch or dinner ! definitely my favorite vegan spot in noho ! 
if you don ' t like this place , you are clinically insane . cheap . quick service . fantastic food . put it on the board . 
the bf and i stumbled upon this sheerly by accident . following our starvacious appetites , we followed the scent of pizza and the oodles of people coming in and out of this place . we figured " hell , why not ? " and put in a reservation . a half hour later , we were lead down the stairs and seated at a table adjacent to the wine bottles neatly displayed on the shelves . beautiful ! ! wine and pizza . now that ' s what i like ! ! so we wound up ordering a large pizza with N toppings on it . onions , garlic spinach , mushrooms , some sausage , and another topping that i can ' t seem to remember off the top of my head , along with a raspberry italian soda ( topped with whip cream ) for myself . and can i just say now . . . . my eyes nearly rolled back into my sockets . ok fine , who am i kidding ? they did roll back in their sockets and my heart started doing cartwheels in my chest . i was in love . between the two of us , we had polished off about N N of the pizza . it was that good . i definitely recommend going here for a bite and if you ' re appetite still isn ' t satiated by the wonders of this italian dream , then you can walk down the street and pick up some frozen yogurt at pinkberry or some rice pudding at rice to riches . 
food was good and the service was fantastic . the food is more eclectic korean and american food . the price is bit ridiculous for what it is . the service was great except this one caucasian waiter who had glasses , he had a bit of attitude because we asked him for something even though he was not our waiter . we loved the fresh sea urchin over kimchi seasoned grains , but that is about it that left me a great impression and something rather than ordinary . lobsters , lamb , octopus , pork belly - just an ordinary dishes with just a good presentation . oh , and do not order any drinks other than listed on the menu . the bartender has no skill on the basic drinks . one thing that was outstanding was their dessert . sweet potato tart was the best i ever had - decor , taste , and delicateness . 
amazing place that we discovered through a diner next to us the night before who told us it was impossible to get a reservation here . since we were going to a show the next night , i used an online app to see if we could make a late night dinner reservation and voila , we got a N N spot . after a quick subway trip , we got to abc about N minutes early , but when we checked in with the hostess , she didn ' t have our names on the list . turned out the app had accidentally moved our reservation to the following week . no worries , though , she was quick to accommodate us and we had to wait in the bar only N minutes for a table . from the moment you walk in , you can tell this place is the place to be in nyc . the furnishings are white and chrome with black white artwork . the crowd was hip and young and dressed to kill . our server was quite helpful , pointing out special dishes on the menu , and even offered wine suggestions for each entr e . all the food is locally grown and mostly organic . we both started with the heirloom tomato salad with strawberries and goat cheese , which was amazing . the tomatoes were end of season , so they were juicy and ripe with a tang that perfectly complimented the fruit and cheese . hubby had the whole wheat pizza topped with spinach , goat cheese herbs . it tasted way better than it looked . i had the halibut , which was flaky and cooked to perfection . abc kitchen is obviously a trend-setter that deserves the attention it gets . if you ' re in nyc , it ' s worth trying to get a reservation ! 
i wanted to adore this tea house and at first i did . beautiful decor , very inviting and welcoming . i am a tea fan always on the lookout for great tea salons . i was there recently and enjoyed what the soup and tea i had . the server was a bit weird with me though , just a very strange attitude of super fake smiling and when after waiting for my soup for N minutes she came and asked if i wanted to order something else ( the soup had not arrived yet ) , i said i ' d like a glass of water while waiting , she returned to the open kitchen station and simply did other things than bring me water , among others , talking to other waitresses and unloading the dishwasher . the soup eventually came , with a glass of water . after i finished my soup she came to ask me if the food was good . . . . maybe she could have asked before i finished , otherwise , i don ' t see the point of asking . . . i ' ll try them again for their apparently special deserts . 
my boyfriend and i had dinner one muggy sunday afternoon during university city dining days . for N each we got really decent portions , fresh , inventive and delicious meals . the bf ' s dinner ( steak , fried oyster , collards , potato butter ) kicked my salmon ' s a-- in the battle for best dinner but it was a great evening nonetheless . for dessert we both had the lemon curd martini with fresh fruit and it was a m a z i n g . because it ' s a byob i was pretty tipsy at that point and was probably making a lot of noise trying to scrape lemon curd remnants out of my funky martini glass . oh well . the only downside was that we were subject to pretentious foodie talk all night . the waiter would say , " so , how was your meal " and regular people would say , " delicious , thank you ! " whereas the pretentious foodies would say , " fantastic , tender , so flavorful , i ' m especially enjoying the red wine bubbles . how did you make this foam ? it ' s so . . foamy . kind of like the foam i had at ( insert overpriced restaurant name here ) " stfu ! either way . . it was great ! give it a try . 
los embitamos a probar nuestra comida es muy buena los atendemos como usted selo merese . un aludo de parte de todos los empleados ? ? ? 
best coffee in the neighborhood
idk who the new cook is but the food wasn ' t so great this time they charge for delivery despite minimum and the prices deals online are false . 
just went here for the first time last night and i have to say it was a very enjoyable experience . the atmosphere was very nice , going for a modern eastern look . the service was great and all the staff were very friendly and helpful when one of our party had questions . the food is well worth the trip and is just delicious . we had a combination of sushi , hibachi and general kitchen meals and everyone left both full and happy . if you want to have sushi or hibachi , go local and go here . you won ' t regret it . 
burger was very good meat very tasty good charring on outside , while pink on inside great temperature bun was ok fries are good overall rating b 
best sushi place in philly . they have N rolls for around N special . i got salmon avocado , it ' s a decent size salmon sashimi in the roll . i also got the sashimi sampler from the app section ( comes with N decent sized pieces ) . it ' s a sit down place at the sushi bar . small place-can probably fit around N people at a time . i came here during the day at like Npm so there was no wait . they ' re fast with cheap decent quality sushi ! it ' s located on samson between N and N . 
i had about the same experience as curtis -- i noticed this place because of the insane line out front , and was wary about standing in the line . . . but i eventually tried it yesterday . i got the artichoke ( c ' mon . . . the place is named after it ) . it was amazing , with cream sauce on the bread , which was thick and puffy , but not too filling , and tons of gooey cheese on top with flavorful artichoke and spinach embedded in the melted cheese . the N people i was with got the margarita pizza ( " regular " ) and the crab pizza . the margarita was messy and very good , but not nearly as good as the artichoke , and the crab was unique , very good , and had the same cream sauce as my artichoke slice . all in all , a great pizza place if the line isn ' t too daunting . 
i love the fruits and vegetables at eataly . they are always the top quality , very fresh . the products are very high quality but sometimes too expensive for regular home use . i would suggest the buying the ingredients and making fresh pasta at home instead of paying extra to eat it at the restaurant there . same quality but double the price . 
my husband and i went here for our anniversary and we had a good time . while we started off with a poor reception ( the greeter seater receptionist was kind of rude ) , once we got settled in , our server was great and the food was pretty good - the brussel sprout salad was awesome ! the atmosphere is romantic and laid back - the music selection in the background was cool , laid back . i have dined in better places and paid less money - but it was ok . probably wouldn ' t go back . 
i really want to give N stars , but if the definition of N stars is " meh i ' ve experienced better " than N stars it is . presentation of the ramen was appetite enticing . i had the minca salt broth with garlic , now that was very tasty broth . my friends had the shoyu broth , and theirs was too salty . the chasu ( pork ) was delectably delicious , nice and tender and fatty . but the point of ramen is the noodles , right ? the sign said " ramen factory " but why did it taste like our noodles were not housemade ? ? ? ? i had thin , which was recommended , one friend had the thick . they both did not taste housemade . they did not have that freshly made springy chewy texture that you come to expect with a good bowl of ramen . in conclusion , if you ' re in ny and have a strong craving for ramen and you ' re in the neighborhood , then by all means . 
my boyfriend is from naples . he has been wanting to try this place for some time . the pizza was great , the rice balls were not . he had the margherita pizza , i had the carciofi . very nice . however , we would not return because of the service . everyone looks miserable for one . our server was looking off into space while giving us the specials . the busser removed our app plates , only after waiting for me to remove my dirty utensils . i also saw him ask the table next to us if they wanted more water , never removing his hands from his pockets . the wait after finishing our pizza and being offered dessert was extremely long . the check came with our espresso and by boyfriend immediately gave his credit card . the check book was returned as i was taking a sip of my espresso by the server reaching in front of me . i wanted my espresso cup , but was surprised by and arm and an " Nh , i ' m sorry " . it was at that time that my boyfriend actually looked at the check , we were charged for N rice balls instead of N . forget about trying to get our server back . as we sat , everything was removed from the table , including a half full glass of pelligrino . i asked my boyfriend , " do you think they need this table ? " . he said what do you expect , it ' s a pizza place . when you are paying N for N - N inch pizzas , one rice ball and N non-alcholic drinks , i expect more . they really should pay more attention , its the details that keep people coming back . by the way , we own a pizza place . 
had the chicken pita , a nice filling lunch item . . . . . would give it more stars if it wasn ' t for the dismal waitress , who wasn ' t paying attention at all , had to go the counter N times onl to be ignored , since she was so busy texting on her phone . 
fast service , average to above average american food and a good atmosphere keep this tavern consistantly rated in the top of zagats . a mix of business casual clientele , good for a one time special occasion , but not on a regular basis . the zucchini chocolate bread dessert is a must . a little pricey for the meals when you can eat at similar restaurants for half the price and same quality . 
be forewarned the burgers are more like large sliders . the patties are nice , thick and juicy . . . but small , on an equally petite brioche bun . i don ' t know if you have to order it with , but i ordered a cheeseburger and there was no lettuce or tomato with it . i ordered to go , but the fries were a little too oily and soggy for me . it was nice that they offered a spicy , truffled and plain version . i just wish for the combo , there was more burger and less fries in the balance . it left me a little unsatisfied . . . 
this jam is the shizz-nizzle . . . . . . . . nuff said ! ! well , okay , maybe that ' s not enough . see , no matter where you search throughout the slowly redeveloping dowtown area in newark , the quality of food being offered will not compare with this " fresh as can be " locale owned and operated by the sweetest young lady this side of raymond boulevard ( the freckles are what do me in , personally ) . for the cost incurred by an average visitor - say , about N - the quality and , usually , the portions are not only excellent , they satisfy more tastefully and more healthfully than anything else available nearby . lastly , have you had the brownies ? ! holy sh t . . . . . . have the f ckin ' brownies , wouldja ? seriously , man . no joke . now go ! ! 
found this place on yelp and went in on a cold saturday night . the place was pretty small so we waited for a while until we were seated . the scallion pancakes were so good that we ordered another one after we finished the first one . the beef noodle soup was good . the beef chow fun was also delicious . the fruit smoothies were made with real fruit and we liked it so much that we ordered another one on our way out . overall , we were very happy with the food and would definitely recommend anyone who stops by philly . 
looks like i ' m not the only one who ' s had terrible service from the rude lady at the counter . food wasn ' t bad actually , place was rather dirty and at N N in the afternoon ( well after lunch ) that ' s not too acceptable . what annoyed me was getting short changed N . i gave the lady a N bill for a N . N order and got Nc change . that ' s it . when i brought it to the lady ' s attention she was downright nasty . that ' s fine , i ' ve been before and so have the friends i was with . we will never return . 
i dined at fogo this last friday for a graduation dinner . it was a large party and the service usually for a large party has to be great . well the staff at fogo worked hard and met my expectations . they constantly checked on the table and made sure everyone was ok . the food was phenomenal as usual . they also have have a great salad bar too . this was only my second time at fogo and i would recommend them to anyone looking for a brazilian steakhouse . be prepared for unlimited steaks , lamb chicken . they have vallet parking available and they are parking garages in the area as well . 
started our lunch off with some tots for the table , absolutely delicious . i ordered the retro burger and i have to admit , this was one of the best burgers i have ever had . served on a toasted english muffin , the blend of meat inside was so tasty my mouth is watering right now thinking about it . the staff was incredibly friendly and fun and the beer choices were perfect . thanks to gust for the amazing hospitality , great drinks and mouth watering food ! 
i ' ve been here many times and should go more often ! the food is excellent . it ' s is a real hidden gem . it ' s in the middle of a quiet street very very unassuming and it ' s an intimate byob aka small . i prefer this type of byob . the waiter is often franco the owner . he ' s passion for his restaurant is evident in his every move . one evening they had a poached pear for dessert and it was simply amazing . it ' s not always on the menu so hope you get lucky . . . . also the gnocchi is home made , try it , it will not disappoint . 
the food was amazing ! we ordered several tapas dishes and the steak dish as our entree and can honestly say everything was delicious . met the owners and chef and i have to say the blend shows . beautiful people in a wonderful atmosphere . i can ' t wait to go back . ray r . nj
service stinks ! ! kitchen has no idea what they are doing ! 
found this place on my android yelp after getting off the high line . went to pinto with my girlfriend for lunch . we had the lunch prefix for N . we both had the salad and pai thai noodle and the cnu noodles . the salad was very fresh and delicious . the pai thai was very mild by delicious . the cnu was slightly sweet . overall for N it was a pretty good deal . 
one of my favorite places to eat in burlington for sure . the pink lady is incredibly yummy , as are many other menu items . i wouldn ' t reccoment going for lunch- not enough staff to get in and out in a decent time- so save it for dinners with friends . best in the summer months when eating outside is an option . 
best pizza i have ever had . the crispy crust and fresh tomato sauce is paired perfectly with very high quality cheese . i love that they know what they do well and they don ' t mess it up with lots of specialty pies . fantastic in the restaurant or for takeout . if i am ever in the area i make it a point to grab a couple pies . great service as well , everyone is super friendly and helpful . 
fantastic place . . . i come here frequently from my work in morristown , and it has yet to disappoint . the space itself is quaint and intimate , and the service is top notch . most importantly the food is what keeps marras at the top of my list . the menu is diverse and authentic . i highly recommend the zupa di clams appetizer and cajun calamari . delicious . as an entree , shrimp parmigiana and penne vodka topped with salmon will impress . 
a must go . they have it all . flavor-atmosphere , authenticity , pizazz . its philadelphia " old school " love it . 
been coming here for N years , every year gets better . amazing antipasto ! great spaghetti with meat sauce and lasagna . perfect for date nights ! ! ! 
one of my top nyc restaurants and i feel quite lucky that it ' s in my neighborhood . my rating is actually a N . N but that just means i have to round up . the food , service and ambiance are all stellar . for pictures of food items and for a more detailed review please visit my blog - porteno impressed me so much that i had to devote a post just to them . travelingonanemptystomac do yourself a favor - eat here ! 
north end gives princeton exactly what it needs . great comfort food at fair prices . these are the same owners that brought you osteria prococcini and have elevated pj ' s pancake house . try the brussels sprouts . 
good beer , good sandwich , good atmosphere- id go back . the menu is a little expensive for what it actually is , but i was really excited , as a vegetarian , to have options . i went for the tempeh vietnamese wrap . the veggies were sooo fresh and it came with a side of fries that were a mix of sweet potato and regular . it was really good . i also had a few different beers , and the selection was great . with all of the gastro pubs in the city , its not the best or most memorable , but its solid and i appreciate that . 
have been a regular here for many years when traveling to the meadowlands area . while not chinese " haute cuisine " , they offer very consistent , tasty take out fare . shrimp with lobster sauce is an example of a take out staple done well above average . can also offer some upscale dishes , but best to dine in for those . in an byob area , but wine beer store just two doors down and they are very happy to serve . 
the best pizza . the best wings . 
now i ' ve been to tavern on jane a few times , either for drinks or brunch but the other night was the first time i had ever been for dinner . don ' t get me wrong , this is a fav locals cocktail spot but feel free to go on to dinner somewhere else . it certainly wasn ' t bad it just wasn ' t memorable . i was meeting my friend at corner bistro and by N N on a thursday the line was approaching the door . . . major sad face as i had been craving a burger and beer all week . there are more than a few great choice spots around there for dinner but i figured we ' d be able to grab a table no problem , and i was right . we walked into a quarter filled dining room so we were set . our waitress was laid back , which i prefer . my friend that ' s a local told me to order off the specials menu so that ' s what i did . the soup offered that night sounded great , leek with kale and prosciutto but i was eyeing the flank steak and i knew all that would be too much food . my friend knew what he was having right away , the caesar salad and the po boy . the wine selection by the glass is meh , i went with the petite syrah . the caesar came and i had a few bites , average . i then moved on to the cab they serve by the glass which was a bit better . i didn ' t taste the po boy but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it while i was stealing the fries off of his plate , they were amazing . my flank steak came and i will admit it was very tasty . the steak was served with brussels sprouts and sliced potatoes au gratin . i literally could only eat about N N of my dish , it was that rich . on the plus side i took my left overs home and got another N meals out of it so score on that one ! ! all in all , a salad , N entrees , and N drinks came to N . N before tip . the meal was perfectly fine but i doubt anyone is heading to toj for a culinary experience . good solid food at a somewhat reasonable price . 
N words ! taste gggggoooooooood ! ! ! real deal ! ! ! i get my malaysian food fix here for many years already . try many other malaysian restaurants and can ' t seem to beat this place . when you go taste good , you know malaysian food . taste good is on my speed dial . the place is quite small but not the portions of the food and my appetite . got to try dishes- beef hor fun ( wide flat noodels ) with brown gravy-delish ! ! ! hainanese chicken rice-got to eat with the condiments . tofu in sizzling plate hokkien fried noodle kl style beef rendang -tender tender . . curry yong tofu singapore laksa kang kong belanchan roti cani ( indian pancake-curry dip ) satay ( meat on skewer ) singapore curry noodle ( signature dish ) singapore fried noodle the list goes on . . . . the restaurant is next to hong kong supermarket . you won ' t miss it . the husband and wife owners are very friendly and hands on . they are always there . don ' t hesitate to ask them to recommend their dishes . enough said ! bon appetit ! chow down now ! ! ! 
so so delicious the sweetest staff ! never had a bad experience here , it ' s my favorite restaurant in nyc ! 
this is something you never find . . . . a man in his N ' s making some of the best pizza you will ever try one pie at a time with no help from anyone . . . a true pizza experience
i ' v been looking for a place like this for a long time . great and delicious food , friendly stuff and excellent service . the only thing that i would have change is the seating arrangement . . . a little too crowded for me . 
last year after going to the roseland ballroom for the halloween bash with my friend john- we heard about this place from jeanne ' s friends . ( she was the one that convinced us to go to roseland ballroom ) after leaving roseland , jeanne ' s friends offered to take us back home . when we were in their car , they were raving to us about this place that ' s just a cart . they kept on saying how good it was and we got to try it . john is such a laid back character--- he gets all excited about the food too ! so john and the rest of them ended up getting out to wait in that ridiculous line - john asked if i wanted anything . i told him i ' ll pass since i wasn ' t hungry . the driver and i sat in the car and waited for them . during the wait we saw two indian guys approached this one indian guy while he was waiting in line . i guess these two indians were trying to start some mess with this one indian dude . all of sudden that one indian dude ' s friends all came out of no where . there were about N of them against these two indian fellas . i guess since they were outnumbered , these two guys ended up backing away and got into their get away rickshaw . yes , i said rickshaw---not a get away car but a damn rickshaw . the N wanna be gangstas---they shouted after them while the two dudes in the rickshaw shouted back saying they will get them soon . first of all , i found it to be hilarious and second , they are bunch of posers ! if they really wanted to do something , they could have done something - they are just bunch of children ! after that a whole fiasco , they all came back into the car . john ordered this large order of the chicken platter and they got him so excited about the food . i swear that boy gets excited about everything - he ' s so crazy ! they ended up taking us back to my place where john ate his food - i just had a bite from his order . it was good , but it wasn ' t so freaking good like how they were describing it nor did it taste so good that i couldn ' t stop eating it . i ate one bite and that ' s it ! john , who was all excited about it - was no longer excited about it anymore . he thought the same thing as me . however , i am glad that i got to try it and i enjoyed watching the show down while i waited for them . 
i put in a to go order for approximately N included in the order was two slices of pizza . i was told they could not take the order for the two slices of pizza because they were busy and i would have to order the two slices when i got there . really ! ! ! ! ! ! how much longer does it take to add the pizza order to the order that was being prepared for pick up . so you inconvenience the customer and make them wait to order two slices of pizza when they get there to pick up an order that has been called in . really ! ! ! ! ! piss poor customer service . . . . . . 
good coffee
i ' m a vegan ( no meat , dairy , eggs ) and so the crust and sauce must be superb in order to compensate for the substitute daiya cheese i bring to any pizza shop from the bayonne stop and shop . i happily say that pizzalino ' s crust , sauce , and veggie toppings are excellent with any vegan pizza they make for me . i love and request their marinara sauce , as the owner joe explains the only ingredient is fresh and sweet san marzano tomatoes - with no additional spices needed . add this to a well done crust and you have exactly what pizza is expected to be . great pizza and a wholesome honest shop . 
the place was pretty busy on a friday night , but i was able to make a reservation for two at open table friday morning . good food and wine . i order the gratin de ravioles du royans and it was delicious . i didn ' t like the decoration of the place , too cold and modern for a french restaurant . 
i do not get the good reviews- dry ribs bland brisket the worst german potato salad ever--- food sucked ! the lighting was so bright i swear i left with a sunburn beers were cold and they did have a great selection wine they offered two- one was out so . . . merlot only idk- i ' ll be back for a beer but definitely not for dinner i really was hoping this place would be great it could be needs a whole new concept as the bbq thing simply isn ' t workin ! 
horrible . we went for a late lunch ( Npm ) , party of three . seated quickly . the waitress took our order relatively quickly and got the drinks out to us in a decent amount of time . we ordered . and waited . and waited some more . keep in mind that this place had maybe N tables occupied . the waitress swore by the ribs , saying they fall off the bone and are delicious , so i went with the ribs . maybe that ' s what took so long to get the food out to us . when we finally got our meals , they had managed to get the two other meals wrong - one completely wrong in that chicken parm was ordered and they brought out the sandwich and the other was a steak ordered medium rare and it came out medium well . the ribs were the toughest nastiest ribs ive ever eaten and i sent them back . the waitress said they would cook them some more ( and im thinking what good is that going to do - i didn ' t have hours to wait ) . . . and sure enough , they sent the same ribs ( because i had attempted to hack into them in a few areas so it was obvious ) right back out with a few extra grill marks . seriously ? ? wtf . sent them back and got the manager over . he was decent in that he said he ' d ' take care ' of me and i could order whatever i wanted to replace it . well , now being pressed for time , i just ordered a burger and . . . . wait for it . . . they managed to screw that up too . no mention of cheese on the menu but it came out slathered in it and missing the bacon . unreal . manager came over , apologized and comped the burger and drinks . at that point , i was left to eat my burger while my colleagues sat and watched me as they had long finished their meal . getting the attention of the waitress to ask for the check proved to be easier said than done . the manager sat at the bar with his back to us and ignored us completely . as we were walking out , we walked right by him and . . . nothing . no thank you for coming , no apology for continuously screwing up our meal . . . nada . if you are looking for good ribs or burgers , drive a few miles down to the cloverleaf . 
you grow up a block away and you go through the old neighborhood and you are shocked to find the city you grew up in has gone well ghetto . don ' t get me wrong its not the wild west like other parts of newark but its certainly not the old italian area you and your family grew up in . with that said a staple for close to N years is frank ' s . felige is still behind the oven ' s making pizza i ' m not N so he has to be over N but he is still there as are the orange booths and wood paneling from yesteryear . as stated a few booths to sit in if you are so inclined or take out is always an option . remembering the traditional ny style round pizza as some of the best we tried it this past saturday and its still very good but does not stand out as wow man i ' ve missed this place . what has seemingly become their staple and my favorite thing is their " grandpa ' s pizza " . . . this is a large square pie not thick chewy sicilian but a nice balance crust with a " fra diablo " spicy marinara sauce that will absolutely have you running back to the hood once you get taste . fountain drinks and various bottled products are behind the counter and the guys here know what they are doing since they have been doing it for N years . i ' d stay away after night fall unless your packing . all and all still solid and the grandpa pie is really outstanding . street parking is limited . 
whole cooked seabass watercress salad tom ka soup damn i love you
i have lived basically across the street from this new federal donuts location for years and have been anxiously awaiting their opening . i had the chicken with buttermilk ranch seasoning at the south philly spot before and was underwhelmed by the chicken , but found the staff to be exceptionally nice and conversational . i cannot say the same for my experience at this new location . i entered the place and immediately the guy at the counter was eyeing me up , making me feel rushed even though there was literally no one else waiting to order . i had one of their fancy donuts . it was fine , but by no means worth the N and change . maybe if the guy at the counter was the least bit welcoming i ' d give them a pass , but you ' re better off going to the south philly store if you want anything resembling friendly service . 
worth the trip . cool atmosphere not to be out done by the food . fresh seafood and good home cooking greek food . feta appetizer was delicious . definitely would visit again . . . 
this place is awesome and absolutely ingenious ! almost always there is a line out the door and this is for good reason . the thickly cut fries here are so delicious and potatoey , you really do not even need sauce for it because it is great on its own . they do provide samples of different sauces if you like to try before you decide and they are all pretty good , however my favorite is the sweet mango chutney mayo . heaven ! i ' ve tried the poutine here before and honestly i was not a fan at all and threw a lot of it away . i never ordered it again but to each their own because i know a lot of people who actually really like it . for the regular ( smallest ) size one it costs N . N but an extra N . N for sauce on the side . although some say its expensive , i think its worth it because you get a lot and it is definitely more than enough to share with a friend or two . quality and quantity ! 
way too expensive for what you get . you can pay less elsewhere and get better food . not all it ' s cracked up to be . 
dang . i want to give this place more stars . but i just cant . . dag . so i got the president obama which is fried chicken and two sides . i got the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes . ill start with the good . the chicken , fried perfectly , so much crunch , the chicken was cooked perfectly , nice and juicy . it was very well cooked . sides were solid , but nothing crazy . on to the bad . . . two pieces of chicken ! ? a leg and thigh ? with two sides . . . its N some bucks ! ? oh my goodness . last time i checked , when you have comfort food , part of it being comfort food is getting a crap ton of food . c ' mon now . and yes i know the chicken was cooked perfectly , but as a whole it was lacking flavor . . . was kinda ' disappointed about that . and the sides , pretty bland and nothing to write home about . overall , i left more disappointed than satisfied . maybe it was overhyped , but mann . . . c ' mon now . amy , you ' re killing me . i want to like you more . dang . 
great meal ! franco is back . 
kogashi miso ramen is probably the best ramen you can get in ny ( or america ) . the only other thing that was worth noting is the spicy chicken donburi you can get at the lunch set . otherwise , everything else is good but not great . 
this is the superior pizza option on planet earth . 
better have a little something before coming here for brunch , i waited for an hour before getting seated . the service is very friendly , so cant get too upset for waiting . all the dishes were pretty good , but a little on the heavy side on their sauces . definitely a place for comfort food . 
we were very excited to try porteno ' s because of the N . N stars given by fellow yelpers . the main entrees were not very good , slightly less than average . let ' s start with the good stuff , the stuff that deserved the stars . wait staff was nice . decor is cute . the desserts were fantastic ( peach tart bread pudding w gelato ) . the appetizers were average . empanadas were okay ( beef ) and the salads were alright . the main entrees were a supreme disappointment . oh my goodness . salmon , boring . roasted chicken , dry ( but flavored well ) . penne w mushroom , bland needed salt . matambrito con papas doradas , worst than cafeteria food . sea bass , not too bad . we were not impressed , not at the very least . it was my friend ' s birthday i was embarrassed for choosing this restaurant . embarrassed . 
easily the best deli in hartford . . even if there was any debate over the best deli in hartford , the prices would give cornerstone the crown
for a strip mall sushi place , it ' s not bad . pricing is actually reasonable but if you are so inclined there is almost always a coupon on the back of your stop shop receipt ( in the same strip mall ) . just be warned that this place looks like a club and you have to get use to eating sushi with the neon lights around you . 
my favorite burger spot in the hood . love love . . wish they had tater tots ! just sayin . 
this pizza is absolutely delicious . the speck pizza was great and the white and green with arugula was light and tasty . the calzones other people were ordering looked amazing . can ' t wait to go back and try them . 
the food is just okay . not enough flavor , over cooked , and definitely overrated . it seems to me that the restaurant is trying to have both ways - doing take out and letting in house customer wait . very good server but unfortunately many flaws in operations . loud very loud place . be aware . 
this is the place to eat on manhattan ! we where a group of four from norway and we just loved this place ! if your on a budget it ' s probably not for you , but the food is amazing ! we had a blonde waitress from australia , and she was the best ! joking and having tons of fun with us ! we loved her ! we had the chefs tasting menu and it was delish ! and the rose that went with the second course was insane ! best rose we ever had ! had to wait N minutes for our table so we had oysters first at a bar-like-place ( inside the food house ) and wow , what a perfect place to have oysters for the first time ! we ' ll definitely go back there the next time we are in nyc ! 
we tried the fixed menu for dinner and loved it . this is an expensive restaurant , but the food and drink specials were great ! i think it came with N courses ? it was a lot of strong drinks that night . but everything was delicious . at first , we thought the portions were on the small side , but at the end of dinner we left very full . this is definitely a place to try or visit again . 
every time i get lunch at tina ' s i feel like a shorten my life by a day , but it is probably worth it . it ' s not exactly their fault i guess , because there are some healthy items on the menu , but every time i come i can ' t help getting the super delicious fried pork sandwiches topped with plantains and mayo . yes , fried pork and plantains . it tastes as good as it sounds . throw your health to the wind and come get this sandwich . 
the service there was deplorable . the food was something i could make at my house . the waiter was overall very disrespectful and overall unprofessional . i would avoid at all costs
so very bad . eataly is italian cuisine vomited up by good taste . the idea is interesting enough to bite , but the execution pains the soul . this place is an offense to all senses . it is logistically confusing , the food is sub-par for cuisine that should have been created by some of the industry ' s most recognizable chefs , and the vision is too scattered . to read the poster that explains eataly prior to entering is to be perplexed to try to navigate the strange design of space , crowds and stressed out employees is to be gravely annoyed to taste foods that are not worth the time spent on long lines and expensive prices is to be utterly disappointed . for the prime real estate that eataly has , new york deserves better representation of italian cuisine . mario and lidia , my heart has sunk and my respect for you , deteriorated . 
so a few days ago , me and another friend were on a quest for real ramen and the first place we thought of was " mincas " because based on the rave reviews ive seen here , it must be good . or so we thought . after a long trip here in a secluded area , we both got gyoza and chasyu ramen , which is supposedly good here . we were wrong . what happened next was , i started eating it and it was horrible ! ! ! i dont know what these guys are talking about but the ramen we got was bad , the egg pork was cold and sometimes i think it smelled rotten to im like wtf am i eating ? ? the chasyu is full of fat and it was about to me give a me a heartburn . . the gyoza has absolutely no taste and paid N dollars for that pos ? a compelte ripoff considering i couldve gotten something way better in chinatown for N dollar and it tastes better . i felt like throwing up after that ramen and my friend agreed to since he knows how real ramen tastes like and this is disgrace to " ramen " . if you want real ramen , try rai rai ken ' s , which is way better . 
can ' t wait to go back to meal because there are so many more things i want to try from the menu . outstanding selection for starters and salads . enjoyed the delicious mac and cheese and arugula salad . this alone could of been my meal but i was sharing . i decided for my main course on a small portion of hangar steak . perfectly prepared . great service and high quality food . i must return . 
yummy
don ' t wanna wait ? maybe try showing up at N N pm on an early sunday evening in the summer . that ' s what happened on my birthday night a couple of weeks ago here . it felt like a miracle , some kinda pizza miracle , to not witness that winding line- cause i ' ve done that move before too waiting and waiting and watching dom demarco expertly forming pie after pie , as a son keeps track of all the many orders on his yellow legal pad . oh i ' d wait for it , but it was sweet to not have to queue it up forever , this time . i appreciate expertise in life . that ' ll go double on the pizza tip , cause the ole gal loves her pizza . pizza expertise is happening here . there ' s been a one-man show of it for about N years at this shop on avenue j , happening in front of your eyes while you wait and watch every pie made , pulled outta the oven , and every snip of fresh basil scattered on top . this man slides the sicilian pans off the peel with the side of his thumb . that blackened sheet was just in an N degree oven . brick thumbs ! ole brick thumbs , i ' ll call ' im . . . by the way , i do love the square slices here too , but my top faves would have to be the regular thin , crispys . yeah definitely just like everybody and their mamas i like the pizza from difara . mozzarella di bufala , italian tomatoes , fresh basil , olive oil , crunch . . . i ' m in . well anyway , as a pizza lover , and a lover of experts doin things expertly , mark me down as one who has a soft spot for difara . it ' s heart warming , it ' s belly warming , i can easily well a tear like a cinematic italian at the opera about it . 
we have been there a few times and the service food is very good . the decor seems to be nice . there was a minor issue with our order and they fixed it quickly . the decor is good and the seating area is large . i highly recommend sarson ka saag and roti to anyone who goes there . the variety of chaat is very good and it ' s different than what you get at most of the places . some of the items are pricey but then you get what you pay for . 
we were looking for some cheap eats in the elmhurst area and thanks to yelp we came across joju . and i ' m very glad we did . we ate ( and rated ! ) the following -spring rolls d , small , pre-made tasting -summer rolls a , light , fresh , and chunky home-made peanut sauce -bbq pork bahn mi a , huge , tender meat , crisp veggies -bulgogi bahn mi a , huge , spicy kimchi , fatty meat , great flavor the menu is small but specialized and the staff is happy to help with suggestions . there are a handful of appetizers , N varities of bahn mi ( classic , chicken , bbq pork , bulgogi , porkchop , pork belly ) bubble teas , and desserts . bargainistas will love this place because the cheapest sandwich is only N and they give you a punch card for a free sandwich after you purchase N . i was delightfully surprised to learn that they serve cafe du monde coffee ( nola represent ! ) i will definitely be back to fill up my stomach and punch card . 
food is amazing . the eggs benedict are probably one of the better ones i ' ve ever had . even the sides that came with were well made . the salad has a light flavorful dressing and fries were devoured . the pancakes were crispy on the outside and a fluffy cake like consistency where they dissolved in my mouth . out of this world . i didn ' t even realize how much i ate ! the only downfall was the service was slow and they kept trying to take my plate when i wasn ' t finish so i felt rushed . 
i love everything about prospect . i ' ve had the good fortune to dine here many a time , and each experience has been better than the last . their menu changes frequently , and although it ' s never particularly long , they appreciate the value of variety . speaking simply of the proteins , i ' ve had the pleasure of inhaling octopus , sweetbreads , beef , foie gras , scallops , quail , duck , lobster and more . each and every dish has been gorgeously presented , expertly cooked , and unfailingly interesting . not to mention , completely devoured by me and anyone i care to bring along . the sheer talent of the kitchen is evident in every bite , and their specific genius is in the deft balance of so many different ingredients in combinations that would never occur to us mere mortals . of particular note is that accompaniments are never an afterthought when baby brussel sprouts and charred onions are even more desirable than the dry-aged sirloin on the same plate , you know there is some sort of wizardry afoot . to be sure , vegetables do not take a back seat here . don ' t sleep on the sides the crispy cauliflower is salty , garlicky perfection , and if fries strike your fancy , they are rarely this well-done . the market vegetable plate changes daily but is always an herbivore ' s dream . the baby beet salad is stunning , and when in season , the burratta and heirloom tomato salad is absolutely breathtaking . ( yes , i ' m talking about food here , and i regret nothing . ) to be fair , such talent has its price . no one i know can afford to dine here every night , but meals this good should be reserved for the right occasion anyway . after all , prospect is unabashedly using the best ingredients available , and believe me when i say that this is food worth paying for . as i delude myself more and more into thinking i know what i ' m doing in my own kitchen , i become that much more impressed with restaurants that can offer me meals that i could never hope to duplicate . chef kyle mcclelland is simply on another level . it might be easier to avoid returning to prospect over and over if the dining room wasn ' t so inviting , if the service wasn ' t excellent , if their barrel-aged cocktails weren ' t so tempting , and if it wasn ' t within walking distance . unfortunately for my desire to try new restaurants as often as possible , i haven ' t found faults as of yet . ( i suppose if i have any complaints at all , it would be that the lobster cappuccino that i was once fortunate enough to taste has never made another appearance on the menu . ) as it is , this is beautiful food served in a comfortable atmosphere , and you ' ll find me there again and again . i ' m definitely not sad about it . go here , and you won ' t be either . 
ok , . . i will start by saying when i lived in nj and would go after work once a week and the place had different ownership this place was great . yes its in the hood , but never a problem . went a few weeks back to check it out with some friends . . . i was like wtf ! the crowd flipped on this place . i felt like i was mike j fox in " back to the future " . food was whack , crowd was really whack . music and drinks were the best thing here . i have spoken . 
i had been hearing good things about this restaurant , but admit to having been skeptical . first , the name put me and my wife off salt and fat are of course ( much beloved and often criticized as unhealthy ) ingredients of nearly any meal , but making them your name seemed gimmicky . also , the menu appeared to be overloaded with trendy ingredients like foie gras , yuzu , and truffles , and the main ingredients made it look like the meal would be unavoidably heavy . finally , i am suspicious of " asian fusion " --it never seems to be as good as the pure asian cuisines . the location is convenient but not necessarily where you expect to find a good restaurant a small storefront on queens blvd . near the Nth st . N stop . the decor is odd . the place was formerly a korean restaurant and the space had been renovated by the previous restaurant i believe . there are a lot of light-colored mouldings and faux stone finish on the lower part of the walls . the no reservation policy means you may have to wait an hour to get your table , but they will take your number when you show up and you can go for a drink elsewhere so it ' s less annoying than you ' d expect . once seated , the service is friendly and helpful . the food is simply excellent . in spite of the use of exotic fats ( a small bag of popcorn cooked in bacon fat is delivered to the table immediately ) , the food does not seem greasy or heavy . nor does anything seem over-salted ( an accusation frequently leveled at restaurants by my wife ) . from the truffled beet salad to the yellowtail tartare to the scallops to the brussels sprouts and finally the fried chicken , everything we tried was flavorful , inventive , and simply delicious . the fusion ( mostly korean and american , i would say ) really works for a change . the scallops were perhaps the best i ' ve ever eaten . portions are mostly " small plates " designed for sharing , so you are likely to order mored dishes than at another restaurant , but the prices are not bad and you get to try more things that way . the wine and beer list is not huge but has some interesting , unusual options to try . this is easily the best restaurant in sunnyside , and perhaps the best restaurant in queens . 
just had one of the most delicious duck fries ever . a very good spot after a full day ' s work . 
the online reviews make this place sound great . it ' s not ! 
i can ' t believe so many " oh-so-precious " little yuppies have published their precious little thoughts here . there ' s a nice , safe , brightly lit olive garden just around the corner waiting for you , with just the kind of special food you deserve . tiffany will be your server . and the little girls crying about the parking . the place is on a city street for crying out loud . i travel once or twice a year from " down the shore " to the belmont because there ' s nothing like it . walk in the door and get a ballantine from jimmy and make some small talk while you wait for your table . there ' s no list , no beeper , no podium . they ' ll tell you when it ' s your turn . whaddya need a menu for ? eat your salad and bread while you wait for your pasta and then your savoy . cow bell ringing ? it ' s ready . it ' s as close as you ' ll ever come to sitting in a room filled w strangers that feels like a big family dinner w all the cousins over . it ' s not a blast from the past , it ' s timeless . finish up w some expresso in an aluminum pot over a flame , and a shot of sambvca . get back on parkway . repeat N months later . 
listen , they got me so far . andrew and rest of staff rock . although waiting it was made very pleasant for us plus the drinks . the food was awesome , although i would like the guacamole to be spicy ( fish tacos were yummy , and just about everything we had which was non-meat . i have talked to friends and people there that give the meat options N thumbs up . plus drinks are stronger than you think . i will be back to try the brunch and see if i can increase my review . again , all the appetizers were delish and the pitchers of sangria or margaritas ( 
fish is good , but it ' s overpriced . the environment was ok , nothing special . i ' m not sure that the N dollar specialty rolls are worth it it ' s literally no bigger in size or taste to justify a Nx hike . and the waiters keep pushing you to order them over the traditional rolls and pay in cash ! bad manners , however nice it tried to come across , it was wrapped all in greed and annoyance . so many better places for a fraction of price . stay away . 
this place is a first date must ! one of my favorite hidden gems in nyc , the food is phenominal ( try the puffed dough appetizer or the balsamic chicken ) and the atmosphere is very romantic . a perfect spot if you want a great meal at a very very reasonable price ( entrees about N-N ) to things to note it is cash only , so make sure you plan in advance , and they do not take reservations , so either get there early or plan on dropping your name in and going next door to the wine bar for a drink , don ' t worry the maitre d will come get you ! enjoy ! 
this place is okay . its a little plain they could put a little more flavor . they messed up my order , but watever that was they gave me was pretty good . the servers was not as attentive as they should be . i was dying of dehydration because they didnt fill the water . 
great service , really nice people . had a nice " visiting " selection . food was great too , had the flat bread which was really great . 
the dish i ordered capenelli limone was not that good . butter tasted rancid and there was no hint of lemon at all . the shrimp in the dish was good though , well cooked not gummy . the sangria was so-so . the waist staff was super friendly and efficient and bec of them am willing to come back and try another dish . 
awesome service and atmosphere ! i ' ve been here quite a few times and that is definitely going to continue . whether it ' s lunch or dinner , the prices are very reasonable , compared to all the other restaurants in the hells kitchen area . you will definitely leave full . the decor is amazing , you are definitely entering a mysterious , yet beautiful realm . from what i have seen , lunch is usually a quieter time to have a relaxed one-on-one . the lunch specials are a must , they include one appetizer and one entree . the portions are definitely good enough to fill a hungry chap . the chicken skewers are just generous and juicy . for lunch , i usually get the pad woon sen . this is stir-fried glass vermicelli mixed with vegetables , egg , and shrimp . again , the portion is very generous , and the taste is just addicting . now the good part dinner . their squid ink spaghetti is their own specialty . it ' s a bit spicy , but it is balanced out with the rest of the dish which is filled with calamari , shrimp , and vegetables . the pasta itself with the sauce is just enough on its own . if you are a first-timer at here , i definitely say go all the way and hit up this dish . it might be a little dark at dinner , and the noise level is definitely up there that you will definitely have to talk louder to be heard . but overall , it is a reliable , affordable , and very satisfying place . 
what a tourist trap ! ! i can ' t believe it ! first , their pizzas are honestly just ok . i ' ve eaten hundreds much better . the place looks like a disneyland restaurant to illustrate the movie " lady and the tramp " . the price is insane N for a basic margherita , on which you have to pay N or N each ingredient . plus taxes and tips so basically it ' s like N a pizza . wtf ? ? ? ? and it ' s N if you go for the large one ! their wine is awful , just go for the fountain soda . it may not be better but at least it ' s cheaper . my worst food experience in nyc ! 
excellent dinner here . small place but great menu . and i just love the bread and butter that they give you at the table . it ' s so hard not to request more . entrees are great and the byob policy is a huge plus . can ' t wait to try brunch as well . note , cash only . 
i love these outdoor vendor set-ups that urbanspace has been setting up ! especially broadway bites because it ' s staying put for the whole summer . there are a ton of different vendors to choose from with a variety of types of food . i ' ve tried a lot of them and have yet to be disappointed ! the vendors i have tried include - brooklyn taco - mason jar nyc - breads bakery - roberta ' s - hong kong street cart - seoul lee korean bbq - mayhem and stout - mighty balls - charlito ' s cocina - arancini bros - macaron parlour - melt - red hook lobster pound ( wow this list looks so long written out , but i work a couple blocks away so i ' ve had a ton of opportunities to try the different vendors so far this summer ! ) seriously , everything i tried was so good and so unique . some of the vendors get busier than others , but the lines move pretty quickly . the only downside is that it can get a bit pricey , but i think it ' s worth it for a nice switch-up lunch during the work week . 
huge , amazing space ( all stone , huge fireplace in the middle , retro fittings on the bar ) and great selection of beers . really good place to throw a birthday party- since it ' s so big , you don ' t have to get there N hours early just to save a table the way you would at radegast , brooklyn brewery or the standard beer garden . i also like the selection of food better than other beer venues . 
the atmosphere is amazing . i can come on a date with my husband or bring the whole family . the chef makes the best calamari around . reasonable prices and they have every sporting event on tv . i recommend this place highly ! ! ! ! awesome ! ! ! 
not much of a selection and the sushi was not that great . 
loved to go to this place when i went to nyu . if you get lucky , you ' ll beat the lines and get the chicken falafel ! 
parc is fantastic . the manager , brooke , really knows how to keep customers happy . the food is great -make sure to get the peche beer , vanilla ice cream float ! 
i decided to impress my new mother and father in-law by taking them to a nice dinner . i didn ' t have to think too much before i knew nai tapas would be the perfect place . i was definitely right ! from the minute we walked in we were greeted and sat right away . we had a table right in front of the live flamenco band which was a plus . we ordered a variety of tapas and each one out did the next . the tropical sangria was also very good and the entertainment was amazing ! i know i scored some extra points with the in-laws by bringing them to nai tapas ! 
i tried everything on the menu except the chiptole chicken taco and i must say my top favorites is the taco platter ( fish , steak , pork ) and the break room burger . everything on the menu has great rich flavor . the homemade lemonade was so refreshing and the perfect break from all the fried foods . and it was on the house ! the waiter made it right in front of me ! ended up staying and watching sunday football . can ' t wait till they start selling beer and wine ! ! 
i get emails from yardley inn that talk about specials and such . i got one last week that advertised wild boar . i was interested to try it . went saturday night and it was awful . it was ribs and the meat was so tough and grissly that you couldnt even get it off the bone . usually the food is good here , but this was horrible . don ' t order it . 
el camino is a cool place . the short ribs are borderline amazing . my only complaint is that there menu seems small . get the fried pickle to snack on . they ' re awesome ! 
don ' t bother to go . we went last night . we had to ask the server what the specials were , she didn ' t volunteer the information . after two hours we were served drinks , one appetizer , four salads for N . we never got our meal . we watched people around us who were seated after us be served and finish their dinners . did the manager offer to do anything ? a glass of wine for our trouble . they said they had too many people walk in " off the street . " they said the kitchen " blow up " and could handled it ! can you imagine saying that to a customer ! the manager told me he " didn ' t care what i thought about his restaurant or who i would talk to it about . " silly me , i thought because i made a reservation , we could count on this place . as i started , don ' t bother to go . you don ' t know what you will get except a lot of excuses as to why they didn ' t deliver what they promised ! 
i wanted to try some cuban food while i was out in nyc . not gonna lie i was expecting a party in my mouth considering it should be more authentic since we ' re in the east coast . i live out in california and theres a place called florida that was a bit tastier . the beef steak was good and the octupus salad was a little more than mediocre . nice little hole in the wall . my bf had the chicken and it was juicy and tender but still no party . 
super crowded and a little overwhelming . you just need to be prepared when you go in to wander around a bit to get your bearings down . there are coffee places , gelato and dessert counters , several restaurants , a grocery area , and probably more that i just didn ' t see as i got pushed from place to place . we settled on the pizza pasta place . had over an hour wait and when we finally got our pizza we were not blown away . it was good but not great . i wouldn ' t go back for pizza . i just feel that there are too many other great places to eat in nyc . with that said , there were several other restaurants to try , so i would certainly read those individual reviews before making a decision to skip the place . if you have never been to eataly , i think you should at least walk around and pick up coffee , gelato , or dessert . overall , it is a really , really neat concept . 
more vegan options than i expected . the collard green wrapped farmstead was hardier than expected . 
bbq north of the mason dixon line is always problematic . in the case of fette sau they have repurposed a great old structure and created an indoor outdoor environment that is perfect for enjoying smoked meats . however , they have a ways to go with the meats . the brisket was tough , and unfortunately both of the bbq sauces were unremarkable . the best parts of the meat were the burnt ends that they threw in . should be added to the menu in my opinion . sides were good . baked beans had a nice smokey flavor and were not too sweet . house made half sour pickles were outstanding but the mushrooms were pedestrian . craft beer selection was very good . fette sau will get there when they perfect the little things . 
all i could say is that this is by far my favorite thai restaurant . everything from food to decor is incredible ! 
cheap , good falafel at ungodly hours of the night . win ! line can get a little crazy , but i guess this comes with the territory . 
you must try this place at least once . oh my , the food is just delightful . i ' ve been here for brunch and had the mac sandwich which was a lil tricky to eat but very delicious ! ! i ' ve gotten the fried chicken in cheese sauce with a side of mac more than a few times and it ' s sooooo good . seriously , i get cravings for this stuff . the bloody mary ' s are also perfect . if you like spicy try the jalape o infused vodka ) 
philadelphia chutney company catered a meal for N people for me and they were fabulous ! they were wonderful with planning the menu , discussing prices , and confirming pick up time . they opened early to have my order ready and everything was ready on time ! they even carried the food to my car . everyone at my event loved the food ! next time i am in philadelphia , i will eat here again and order extras - all the food went so quickly ! 
this was by far the most enjoyable meal i have eaten . it is a beautiful , magical restaurant with the kind of food that makes you feel like royalty . the service is impeccable . yes , it is expensive , but it is so worth it . i wish i could treat all of my favorite people to meals here , so they can understand why i love food so much . 
the food here is not authentic . it is really bad . the food was just not fresh and bread was stale . i highly recommend not to go here . 
yum ! seriously ! first things first , the staff were friendly and talkative ! they have a pretty big menu and sometimes no matter how long you ' ve stared at it , you still seem to forget what you want by the time you get to the front of the line . with that being said . . . they don ' t rush you and i appreciated their suggestions and recommendations ! the falafel was flavorful and crispy ( as it should be ) . you get quite a bit of food with the platter . i couldn ' t finish it . try the eggplant ! delish ! it ' s an absolute must ! 
cuban food doesnt get any better than at cuban petes ' dominick the owner is awesome ! their steamed pollo with garlic is to die for ! too bad is byob so you know your sangria is watered down- bring your own bottle of wine and they will be more than happy to stir that into your sangria . great place for bdays - ) they do this loco spanish bday song complete with drums and tamborines ! ! ! oh man , if it is not your bday , fake it ! you will be entertained - ) flan is great here , and they have probably one of the best outdoor seating in town ! cuban pete ' s is a must , will recommend this place to everyoneeeeeeeeeeeeee ! 
i went back to genos last week for the first time in years loaded steak lots of meat , the roll could ' ve been better , the place is still the cleanest in town , a good place to take out of towners for their first steak ! 
this is the kind of place i like to go to when i am traveling . it involves locals and their food ( and oh yeah tourists of course ) . there is a piano player . loved the pretzels and pickles made by the ammish . the veggie restaurant was great with fake tuna and chicken salad . bought some chocolate covered pretzels here as presents . 
buen sitio nice para que vallas fam
i have bad gas and here ' s why . tonight i went to palma for a simple pasta . pasta is simple - it take a crap cook to screw it up . also - paying N-N for pasta is fine - if it ' s good . palma ' s pasta was below average . not the type of average where you say " eh , that wasn ' t great " , it was actually bad . the three of us had different things . i had the lamb ragu pasta . maybe because of the recession , lamb meat is scarce . so maybe palma feels they have to preserve their lamb by salting it to death . my pasta lamb ragu was salted to death . it was crap . my wife asked for a plain pasta with tomato and basil . her food came out late and also tasted crap . the thing is , pasta is easy to make as i said before - how you can screw up a pasta with basil and tomato is beyond me . anyways - i have gas now and my wife won ' t sit next to me as i write this review . what crap . 
sorry but when you say half a chicken on your menu i expect half a chicken ! not a thigh leg and wing ! and not served on a side plate for over N for dinner . very very disappointed , will not eat here again , N for N starter N glasses of wine and N entres is just over priced even if i ' d actually got the half chicken and it had been served on a dinner plate ! 
my absolute favorite restaurant when it comes to food . . . atmosphere is ok service is ok . . . . and getting a reservation is like pulling teeth but besides that the food is absolutely the best in nyc
so yummy ! the ingredients in the banh mi are soooo fresh and never disappointing ! the cilantro really makes it for me in a banh mi and the cilantro is sure kicking every time i take another bite ! if you choose to get the spicy option the peppers are always fresh and also pretty spicy ! but don ' t be a whimp ! the service is quick and they make sure to pack everything in individual paper bags when you make multiple orders . i also like how employees are working in an orderly assembly line to make things extra quick and smooth . in addition to their fresh food , there are refrigerated drinks in their self-serve fridges and also an array of packed personal baked vietnamese pastries to the side . this place does not disappoint and i would not know why anybody else would go anywhere else for banh mi . the prices start at N . N and end around N . also , the restaurant is actually fused with a jewelry store ( in the front ) so if you choose to sit on one of the stools- i mean i guess it wouldn ' t hurt to admire some jade jewelry during your banh mi . 
i never realized you could screw up jewish food that badly . the potato pancake was terrifying , an overcooked grease sponge . it was the greasiest piece of food i ' ve ever been served , it didn ' t look anything like what a potato pancake should look like , dark brown and shaped like a blob , i took one bite and i couldn ' t take another . the stuffed cabbage was a greasy sloppy mess with oversized hard stuffing . i got down like three bites . the matzo ball soup had one ball that was so huge that the inside didn ' t cook well and was like a hard dense core i had to leave over . my jewish grandmothers would have been horrified . the worst jewish meal i ' ve ever had . the cooks were clearly not jewish and clearly had no decent instruction on how to do it . how does this place stay in business ? i certainly won ' t be going back . 
believe the hype . man i love this pizza . i started going here way before food network and the popularity and the pizza is good . its so good it will ruin you for other pizza trust me . it doesn ' t help that lombardi ' s has some really hot waiters too . make sure you get plenty of the sauce and try the chopped garlic . 
never got into vietnamese cambodian style sandwiches but definitely don ' t regret eating here . they have a wide variety if sandwiches and i recommends the three spices pork belly , tiger coconut shrimp , and the pulled pork duroc . the basic pulled pork is the best value because the other sandwiches start to get a little pricey for their size . i love the crisp bread they use that ' s crunchy but not too hard . the meats are well seasoned and not stiff nor squishy . other than that it ' s just another namwich with nam flavor . 
great , reliable food and a happening spacious restaurant . nice beers on tap . 
i reviewed this place previously before it was turkish food and was mostly arab food . it was good then -- it is excellent now . friendly family-owned establishment that is fresh , healthy , extremely tasty and has wide variety for very good price points . . . their buffets have at lest N items to choose from for those curious to try new things . . . . i have tried all and each is as tast as the next- it ' s just what you ' re feeling up to that day . . . i am always a fan of their lentil soup . the young man behind the counter is very nice , and remembers customers from what they regularly order . it ' s also a cute look , ( modern and orange ) with at lesat N desserts freshly baked for your sweet tooth , turkish tea for those rainy days , and some turkish music in the background for a nice touch in the middle of newark . 
great food and really wonderful service . the steak is really solid and the fries are very tasty . their key lime pie is one of the better ones i ' ve tried . the only reason i ' m not giving them five stars is that i wasn ' t completely blown away by the food . they are however quite worthy of a dinner visit . come early as they tend to get busy even on a weekday . 
love sanford ' s . i have yet to have a bad meal from here , be it breakfast , lunch , dinner , or a delicious late-night snack . their desserts and appetizers are some of the best i ' ve ever had , especially the cheesecake xangos and ebi shrimp fry . they ' re a bit on the pricier side but so worth it for a consistently awesome meal . 
welcome to the neighborhood wheated ! came during the soft opening saturday and can ' t wait to go back . the decor is really cool , the pizzas are fantastic and creavtively named after some surrounding neighborhoods ( the brighton beach bacon is heaven ) . the bar is eclectic and versatile . the bartenders mentioned to someone i was with that they all the components of their hand crafts drinks are made in the house ( simple classic cocktails similar to clover club ) . very classy and unique for the area . the guy and girl behind the bar had great chemistry together and were on point . the servers were very friendly and kept it all under control despite the rush . this was by far the most organized opening i have seen . just to warn everyone now get there early . they ran out of pies pretty early and i can see that being a constant occurance ( we got one of the last pies ha ha ha ) . again , welcome home wheated ! 
this place is wonderful . claudio is adorable . what great service , tapas , drinks and food ) . i am super picky but this place sold me . i am the way from la and i begged them to open a location closer to me ( yes , in california ) . please visit them and spread the love ! this place is reasonably priced , has tons of parking and it is a great place to socialize and have some fun with friends ) 
it ' s ok . i mean , the portions are kinda small and the food is not amazing at all . it ' s fun for socializing . hey , speaking of socializing . . . the one guy who works there is so hot . the whole time i was eating there with my parents i couldn ' t take my eyes off the one humpty guy who took our order . i wanted to go down on him in the bathroom so bad , but i couldn ' t figure out a way to signal him with my stupid parents noticing something was going on . i must go there this week by myself when they are slow . i gotta have him . i highly recomend this place on so many levels . 
fig sandwich is to die for . i ' d give it a million stars if i could ! 
a real N hour delivery with delicious sandwiches . so happy i live close to sunny and annie ' s . 
my Nnd time here yesterday really good ! ! ! i has the salmon roll the first time and the crunch roll the Nnd time ! ! ! it ' s so good so filling and i always get a great tea . really nice place always clean . although no parking i always find a spot that i can run in order and leave . see you again . 
i have passed by here several times and never went it . stopped by today , it ' s a great place for a cheap lunch , the food is made to order so expect about a N min wait but the food is good . the place seats about N people so plenty of space to hang out . owners are friendly and attentive . the owner told me " if the customers are happy , i am happy " and for that , i will come back here . 
it was my first visit to this cafe and i was really pleased with the food and the service . i like their croque monsieur . it ' s really yummy . i even bought some for take-out and my parents loved it . 
go there for lunch allot . they have a few a lunch special . for . N you get choice of soup or salad i go for the soup which is always fresh hit and very spicy just the way i like it . i then get the sliced meats with spicy chilis . . it is always so good and fresh . service is top notch . i only have good things to say . 
so i ' m not a regular in williamsburg , but a friend was playing on a saturday night at trash bar with his band . when it was time to go home with my reasonably inebriated roommate and neighbor who hadn ' t eaten since lunch , we decided to find food before getting a cab . i spotted this cart and we decided to give it a try . i wasn ' t feeling hungry , but after my two friends started eating the chicken curry , i said , ok , i ' ll have one too . definitely pricey for a cart , but the quality is something you ' d get in a restaurant , and it is all free range and whatnot . everything was delicious , the rice was coconuty and perfect , the curry was just plain tasty , and the amount of chicken given was really good too . the pineapple salad mix balanced everything nicely . my roommate sobered up right away after eating it too . 
delicious food served quickly ! portions are quite large and could be split between N or even N people . the ambiance isn ' t as appealing as it could be , but it doesn ' t really hinder the delicious experience ! i highly recommend this restaurant if you ' re in the area looking for a quick , reasonable priced , sit down meal . 
i have been going to buco for many years since they were in their other location under martha ' s vineyard and i have come to the conclusion that they know how to offer a pleasant dining experience , generous portions all at a reasonable price . from the attentive staff to the warm and friendly host i feel like i am part of the family as do the other regulars like me that are always there . i highly recommend this place . it is one of my favorites as well as my whole family . 
lupa " osteria romana " is the laid-back little brother of babbo , that wildly successful pan-italian brainchild of mario batali . since this is a roman restaurant , the focus here is on the cuisine of rome ' s home region--lazio . i ' ve been here a few times , and--with the exception of one friday night--found getting a table without a reservation to be remarkably easy . it ' s a dimly-lit space , fashionably cramped , with a bustling bar area . but i ' m here to review the food because , well , that ' s just about all i really remember--after all , it ' s been over a year since i lived in these parts . my ordering was a little unconventional--my standard would consist of two " piatti primi , " part of the " pasta " course of a full italian meal , but perhaps their categorization of the menu was unconventional , because no pasta is to be found in their veal sweetbreads . so , on with a brief overview of what i ' d have each time i ' d go N . bucatini all ' amatriciana a hearty dish of plump spaghetti-like noodles , rich with tomato , onion , and guanciale--smoked pig cheeks . really , it ' s not terribly different from bacon , and that smoky chewiness is what makes the dish . supposedly it ' s one of their most popular items . N . animelle ( veal sweetbreads ) sauteed in beurre-noisette , with ramps ( a type of leek ) . the brown butter gives a smoky flavor to the sweetbreads--hey , don ' t hate on thymus glands , they ' re grrrrreat ! i seem also to remember there having been something like pecans or almonds in the crisp coating . in any event , they ' re divinely succulent and have a texture that is somewhat intermediate between a chicken breast and a properly-cooked liver . N . spiced apician dates with mascarpone it is what they say it is . ' nuff said . service , as i remember it , was attentive but dry . frankly , my dear , i don ' t give a damn , because it ' s the food that counts . 
been here a few times for breakfast and lunch . the whole wheat waffle is always a good choice and all the burgers are excellent . i like the concept they went with here . its hard to find good , no processed food in the area and this spot is a welcome addition . i ' ll definitely be coming back often . 
i love this place . their cuban sandwiches are great . when i use to go out this was definitely the grub spot . it is N hours . their banana milk shake is to die for lol . the employees are nice . my other favorite thing here is their salchi papa ans off course their pink sauce . i make my own at home but it doesn ' t beat the one from banana king ! ! ! ! looking for a quick grub after some drinks this is rhe place . 
this is my favorite indian restaurant in connecticut . their saag paneer always blows my mind ! it ' s rich and creamy spinach is stuffed with the perfect amount of cheese cubes . the classic chicken tikka masala was of course delicious . their selection is fantastic across the board . the service is topnotch . out of all the times that i have dined here , there was never a time that i wasn ' t satisfied with the food and service here . the d cor here is simple but that really doesn ' t matter as they will certainly wow you with their food . lastly , their prices cant be beat for the quality of this restaurant ! my favorites aka must try saag paneer chicken tikka masala malai kofta aloo gobi masala chai mango lassi
a friend and i ate at ilili my first night in the city around Npm . we took the late reservation because it was the first available , the place was totally packed ! we tried their rw prix fixe menu and were bummed that three things were totally sold out the artichokes , the spicy octopus app and the sea bass main . however , everything we got instead was amazing ! we ordered a ton of apps to start and the best were the bok choy and the fattoush- which had cinnamon- dusted pita chips in the salad and a great tangy dressing . i had the vegetarian fatte for dinner and it was amazing . awesome place , definitely recommend . 
just too greasy to eat . gross ! ! 
i love this place . i eat here often by myself . and never feel awkward . i ' ve brought multiple friends here and everyone has loved it ! huge portions , very friendly and accommodating service . i love the tortas ( mushroom is great ) , tacos ( beef is my fav ) , and burritos ( two meals in one for me ) . food is flavorful and there are also a number of vegetarian options . will be back here again and again . a little gem in the neighborhood . 
great food . nice vibe . dimly lit and more for a quiet dinner and drink , when there isn ' t a party bumping downstairs . 
taqueria kermes has been a local staple in ridgewood since it opened last year ! i really could not believe how incredible the food is here , especially the shrimp quesidilla which i usually have when i eat here ! only negative i have is there is no liquor sold yet ! guess best is yet to come ! all in all , i highly recommend them ! 
food is ok , price is a little bit expensive . 
fat buddha might just very well be my new after hours go-to spot . i hung out there this past weekend with kenji h . after a night out . i was hesitant at first b c i didn ' t care for the old forbidden city , but fb has a whole new vibe when compared to fc . the dj plays great " classic " Ns hip hop , on wax too , in technics N ' s , the way it ' s supposed to be . the food is great . the kitchen is open until Nam . we enjoyed the salt pepper squid and it was tasty . the asian-style pork buns sounded enticing i ' ll save those for a future visit . i would return here just to eat the food , even if they didn ' t serve drinks . but fortunately they do . the bar tenders are great too . the place has a friendly local feel to it , as most people there late at night live in alphabet city ev . 
randomly stopped in for dinner on a wednesday night as i was at the royal oak across the street for truenerdtrivia . john ( i think that was his name ) behind the counter was incredibly friendly and while waiting for our orders we talked about buffy as well as other nerdy things . i ordered a burger which was good for a diner burger and the fries were really good . 
we were seated directly next to the server ' s area where they kept the computer . the waiters hovered over my table and bumped my chair with their butts twice . the servers treated us like an inconvenience . we were rushed out of the restaurant . the skin on the bass was charred to the point of being difficult to cut with a knife , much less the edge of a fork . i ' ve given it a chance , and now a second chance . i won ' t waste my money again . 
seriously good food ! my buddy who was living in astoria discovered this place last year . like most manhattanites i was skeptical of crossing the east river to go to any restaurant . i consider myself a " foodie " and this place hits the mark . i usually start out with the salad that contains beets and goat cheese . then on to my favorite , the short ribs over risotto , they are insane ! i usually top it off with a crepe my favorite is bananas and nuts topped with chocolate . philippe , the owner chef , is there every night and prepares every meal . he and his wife mary are very friendly and seem to really care about the quality of the food they are serving . plus they love to engage the customers . one more major factor . . . price . the prices are extremely reasonable , especially when compared to any restaurant in manhattan . bottom line , whether you are coming from manhattan or are already in queens , caf triskell is well worth it . i live on the ues and probably go once a month . 
it ' s amazing what really good food , drinks and excellent company can do . after spending a good part of my day waiting for or screaming at sears , i went to yerba buena in the wonderful company of madhuri and managed to salvage what until then had been a pretty craptacular day . it was pretty crowded on a wednesday at N . faced with either N or N hour wait for a table ( depending on which of us asked ( ? ) ) we sat at the bar . we only sampled drinks appetizers but i left very impressed . while happy with my cocktails choices , the caipirinha ( good ) and the azteca ( tequila , lime , st germain very good ) , i was more impressed with madhuri ' s choices . the poquito picante , made with gin , jalapenos , cilantro , cucumber and lemon juice was very refreshing . as she noted you could really taste the all the ingredients . the appetizers were also excellent . i was quite pleased with seafood ceviche . very fresh and had a nice tang to it . the friendly bartender , recommended the palmitos fries and was on the money with that suggestion . heart of palm fries were seasoned so that they were good on their own or with tasty accompanying dipping sauce . i could have eaten two orders of these myself . it was a bit crowded at the bar but clientele and staff were friendly and i was so happy with food and drinks so it didn ' t bother me . can ' t wait to go back . 
after trying , and really loving , avroko ' s new spot down the street ( saxon and parole ) i thought i would do a first visit to public . glad i did . the food here is unreal from beginning to end . had something like a mushroom ceviche that was tangy and delicious . tried a fish dish that felt really fresh and light and was thankful the chef didn ' t weigh it down with anything saucey or heavy . dessert was worth the calories . salty sweet chocolates and a bite or two of my girlfriends hokeypokey ice cream . this place deserves N stars . 
the food is top notch . i gave it N stars because i just can ' t justify the black label burger price tag . . or some of the others bone marrow , for N pieces , is like N-N the service is excellent , decor is excellent
good food great service very friendly waitress . i ordered karee puff , fried tofu , for and the baby back ribs for appetizer . i loved the ribs the most . the sauce they put on it was rich and delicious . tom yum noodle was my main cause every thing was good def if i have a chance i will go back there again
had a pleasant surprise today when a friend of mine took me out for lunch at colandra ' s . i knew they had a bakery but never experienced their version of mediterranean cuisine . i had a fresh and delicious arugula salad and a broiled bronzini with italian potatoes and broccoli with a pleasant moscato to help it through my digestive system . naturally the bread is fresh baked as well and the meal was exquisite . we ate out in the garden and it wasn ' t too bad . a bit pricey but it was pleasant . 
the food and service was excellent ! a bit pricey with tight accommodations . had an excellent evening until my daughters mentioned it was my birthday . then we were surprised with a small dessert dish that we didnt ask for but even more surprisingly was charged an additional N . N for ! ! ! a low class move that left a bad impression on what otherwise would have been an extremely enjoyable experience
i thought the food here was great . my wife and i had the fish and jerk chicken . great to see this restaurant near me . i give them an a plus ! i will visit again soon ! 
it ' s easy to dismiss this place as just a cafe , but their savory offerings are really tasty too . limited menu so definitely one for fans of real japanese food ( no substitutions ) . i do wonder what is up with the waitresses ' anime voices but service is competent . ( i ' m allowed to say that . i ' m from tokyo . ) 
best hands down food cart in all of new york ! ! N for so much food ? can ' t complain there and don ' t hold back on putting a ton of there white sauce ! that ' s their signature secret ! 
been coming back to the area twice or three times a year and never fail to stop at cosmo for a pie to eat and five pies to bring back to buffalo where pizza is simply terrible . the cosmo family keeps it simple - a decent mozzarella , a light tomato sauce , and a great crust add up to the quintessential jersey pie . yes , i ' ve had a better pie in brooklyn , and an even better pie in naples , but this is the pie that cries " welcome home to jersey " at you . 
the crumb topping on the coffee cake is perfectly proportioned . . . meaning it ' s three times the thickness , three hundred times the density and three thousand times the deliciousness of any other crumb i ' ve ever experienced . ( then there ' s that whole idea that you can throw together sushi , coffee shop , and coffee cake into one cohesive environment . that ' s cute . it works . ) 
what a great start . came for opening night and had a really nice meal great service good prices . so happy to have momos in btv ! 
good food , great beer selection . we ' ve come here several times and have been happy with the dishes we ordered for brunch and dinner . i especially enjoyed their flatbread and sweet potato fries . they also hold events and their sour saturday had a very nice selection of different sour beers to try . 
the food is very , very good . i had an excellent cobb salad here last week and would definitely order it again . i found that the lunch menu was very limited - less than ten options . everyone that i dined with thought that their meal was excellent . however , i thought that almost all of the portions were small and expensive . lunch for four had to be well over N , even with no appetizers , dessert or alcohol . so be prepared to spend some money when you dine here . 
i have no idea why many ppl give N or N stars . the food is almost tasteless . i give two stars for the free wifi period
really good pizza in nyc . i was recommended this by a friend and glad a made the trip . they have the option between sicilian and thin crust . i prefer the thin crust but tried both and was very happy . sicilian was a little greasier but both had great flavor and great crust on both ( although very different obviously ) . will definitely go back when i ' m in the city again . 
a great place for small groups , dates or friends just meeting up after work . . . and possibly the best happy hour in the center ( still ) . the hh food is a bargain . the wine and cocktail menu is perfectly varied . the bartenders are a great asset to this place , especially chris b . 
after being a little put out that i didn ' t have a reservation , they did manage to find us a table . my caesar salad was ok , a little bland . it took about N minutes to flag down the waiter to ask him for fresh pepper . the food was ok but overpriced , it took a while for the waiter to notice that we had finished our meal ( he never did notice that our water glasses had been empty for a while ) . finally one of the bus boys took our plates away . i almost walked out without paying because i just couldn ' t wait any longer for our check . ( nope , no offer of dessert and coffee . ) besides the bad service , it was noisy--impossible to hold a conversation , especially since the party at the next table were sitting practically in our lap . the waiters and bus staff ( which were the only good thing ) were running around like chickens with their heads cut off . you ' d think you were in a diner . if you just want a good italian meal , there ' s got to be a better place . 
pies n thighs catered my wedding in january . they were great to work with and we had a wonderful experience . they were responsive to us from the first time we contacted them--immediately scheduling a tasting for us at the restaurant . their catering manager was really great and we felt that she really wanted to work with us . she was great about coordinating all of the many details of the wedding and everything went off without a hitch . several people told us that this was the best wedding food they ' d ever had . my husband is from texas and requested that they cut the meat in a different way to make it more like what they serve at home . anyone considering using them as a caterer should know that the catering menu does offer quite a few options that are not on the normal menu--and that are a bit more elegant . we also wanted to have plenty of vegetarian options and this was not a problem at all--we had loads of choices . 
don " t expect to find rare beer here easily . beware ! very poor experience ! was waiting for the release of a somewhat rare beer ( kbs ) , and was told to come back every day , which i did for over a week , during lunch breaks and after work , calling in once a day as well . in fact , i was there when the shipment came in from the distributor , and again they told me it would be available the next day . i took time off of work to be there when the store opened , and when i did , the snobby bartender who opened the shop said that even though they weren ' t reserving bottles , he didn ' t know me , so he wasn ' t going to give me a bottle . despite the impression that the cannibal is some sort of vip club in gramercy , i am sympathetic to the fact that rare beers are hard to distribute , but i ' m very dissapointed that they would keep on telling me to come back , only let me know that i wasn ' t a preferred customer when the shipment actually arrived . 
their food is typically great . i have two major issues with this place N ) their wait-staff is terrible . the last three times i ' ve gone ( all within the last two months ) , i ' ve been given terrible service . it ' s not uncommon for my waitor waitress to apparently switch off tables randomly , but in doing so , they tend to never return until i hail them for help . if i ask for a spare plate , it might take a few minutes and me having to ask two different servers . at a brunch spot where you ' re paying N . N for a simple coffee , is it too much to expect it to get refilled once ? this is beside the fact that it ' s not uncommon for a few specific servers to be present with clearly bad attitudes . if you don ' t enjoy the job , N ) fake it , or N ) quit . i ' m sure they can easily replace you ! N ) some food items have gone down hill . specifically , the chicken and waffles benedict . this used to be my favorite breakfast dish in the city , but they switched to sub-par chicken that ' s more akin to the rats that were caught crawling on their tables a while back . the last two times it wasn ' t properly prepared with spicy sauce syrup . for a place charging so much , and with such a great track record , it ' s a shame to see this location hurting so badly now . . . over simply fixed things no less . i ' d recommend trekking up to the northern liberties location until they at least replace the bad management . also , get with the program and accept credit debit already . 
for the first few months , mirchi indian restaurant ( north brunswick ) offered a delicious reprieve from the bland so called indian cuisine served by the rest of indian restaurants in the area . we enjoyed very much the food at mirchi ( north brunswick ) . but over the past couple of months we saw a marked deterioration in food quality , potions and variety . this situation has become worse now that they have been able to drive the other indian restaurants in the area out of business . the once talk of the town tasty chicken dum biryani on their buffet is now bland - there ' s really very little masala and hence the rice is dry . they have cut down on the number of items on the buffet too . but they have not cut the price of their buffet . what ' s worse is that if the food runs out on the buffet they do not refill . we had to beg for more food and when they did re-fill the portion was hardly enough for two people . it is shocking and even borders on deception that they continue to receive more customers even when there was no food and no refill on the buffet . several times i saw the owner ( a well dressed elderly man ) checking the empty buffet trays and then simply walking away without asking his kitchen staff to refill the dishes . i suspect that he was actually controlling the kitchen staff not to refill . there was hardly enough food to serve all the customers they took for buffet . there were no vegetarian dishes no tamarind rice , no curries and even the briyani rice had yet to be re-filled . we watched many couples walk in , quite upset at finding the trays empty . that ' s not what buffet is about . there should always be sufficient food for all the customers at all times during the buffet hours . i am sure the owners know this but are trying to short change the customers only to increase their profits . another misrepresentation and deceptive advertising is that they do not serve throughout the buffet hours . although mirchi ' s normal buffet hours are N . N pm to N . N pm , there was almost no food on the buffet on our last visit at N . N pm . then they did not refill until the end of buffet at N . N pm . all the vegetarian dishes were empty except for rasam and sambar . all meat dishes were empty except for a few scraps of tandoori chicken . we ate what was available and made the best of our friday lunch . when the owner presented the check there was no discount on the price of the buffet . we paid the bill and left very disappointed with the buffet . a more serious deceptive advertising is that they did not serve as many dishes as they advertised for the buffet price they charged . their delicious lamb curry , a strong reason for many to patronize the restaurant , has since disappeared off the buffet . when once they had to place the lassi drink dispenser on another table , now they fill the main buffet table with the lassi dispenser and N large trays with empty glasses . that shows the number of dishes that have been reduced giving way to other utensils , etc . , on the buffet table another important warning is to check and make sure that the glasses , cups and utensils are clean . be wary because we found lip stick smudges on the cups and glasses used for holding lassi . i am extremely disappointed indeed . importantly , you should never visit the restaurant for buffet after N . N pm . don ' t waste your money . you will not get a fair value buffet for your money because they will not refill what food that was consumed by earlier customers . mirchi started off with the promise of delicious home-style food at reasonable prices . now with competition gone , the true colors have surfaced . if you must eat buffet at mirchi ( north brunswick ) make sure that there ' s enough food on the buffet before you take the seat to eat at this restaurant . this way you will not be disappointed and spoil you eat-out experience . just a suggestion , try arusuvai ( north brunswick ) - we have eaten at arusuvai many times and their buffet and food quality is pretty consistent and reasonably priced . they do not cut down their number of dishes and they always refill the buffet . mirchi ( north brunswick ) gets only N star based on their performance in the last couple of months . if i had reviewed them when they first started i would have given them N stars . however i did not review them when they started because i wanted to see how they performed over the period of N months . indian food lover
we were staying at the sonesta for a quick overnight stay from jersey . . . we walked and walked around looking for a bite to eat and came across el rey , and we felt we hit the lottery ! the atmosphere was fantastic , the food wonderful , the mango margarita , the best ever , and the service outstanding ! on our next trip to philly , we will be back ! 
this is the best indian restaurant that i have ever been to . i was very disappointed when i came to usa as i couldnt find a decent tasting indian food corner . i would try out many places with a hope perhaps this is better than the one i tried before . now i can gladly put an end to my search after having tried at this place . i can guarantee - you pick any dish from the menu it will be super duper yummy . bottom line " a must try ! " 
i enjoyed my burger but it was on the greasier side for my liking . but not as greasy as five guys . i wouldn ' t go out of my way to return but i wouldn ' t turn any friends away from shake shack either especially if it was their first time . if i was in the area and craving a burger and wanted something fast i would probably have it again . glad i got to finally try it out ! also , they had friendly employees . i ' d like to try one of the hot dogs next time . 
i signed up for yelp specifically to discuss this restaurant . not because i want to see something bad happen to the place , but because i want to see it improve . the food here is wonderful , and the service is absolutely terrible . a few nights ago i went in with a party of five . the hostess said we would be seated in twenty minutes . an hour and a half later , we decided to leave , due to not being seated . the hostess did nothing to make this situation right , and in fact seemed annoyed when we asked her Nmin into our wait , what the situation with our table was . this restaurant destroyed our night ! this was not an isolated incident . i once waited for ten minutes and never got a menu when my three friends and i were the only people in the restaurant ( around N in the afternoon ) . upon discussing this venue with other friends in the neighborhood , i have heard many similar stories . too bad . the food is truly delicious , the portions are ample , the beer is solid , and ultimately , it isn ' t too expensive . get it together le barricou ! 
don ' t think they have this so-called happy hour anymore , definitely not free wings . someone please let me know otherwise . the food here is surprisingly good , flame broiled monster burgers at half price blow scuffer and rira ' s food away in taste and portions . atmosphere is great to watch a sports game . 
ordered pizzas for staff lunch . N pizzas and two bottles of soda . N hours later , still no food . when i called they told me a few more minutes . i asked if that meant the pizzas were on the way and was not sure from her answer if they were on the way or not . will not order from them again . 
i came here saturday morning for brunch for the first time and like every single weekend this place is packed . there is a friendly person waiting for you to give your name and the amount of people in your party and then you just wait . luckily the weather was good and i was able to get a table outside . this is an amazing brunch place , the food will just blow you away . i had the eggs blackstone and everything about that dish was perfect from the poached eggs to the oven roasted tomatoes that they were placed on top of . i definitely want to come back and have more of their dishes because everything looked so damn good ! 
not sure what all the amazing reviews are about . i came here for dinner on a friday night . food was pretty good , not amazing . perhaps brunch is better . drinks were good too , but it seems every place has good margaritas these days . service was horrible . it was about N degrees out and they had tables setup outside . it was too cold to sit outside so half those tables were empty . we had reservations and arrived on time . they told us if we wanted to sit we ' d have to sit outside , otherwise it ' d be an hour wait . i said we had reservations , they said something along the lines " well , we have a table outside , if you don ' t want it , it ' s not our problem . " what ? ? ? the indifference in their tone pretty much summarized the service throughout the evening . when we finally were seated it took forever to order drinks and food . i had to get up and walk over to the waitress station to ask for the check . never a good thing . lastly , it was so crowded and loud . i felt like i was at a frat party . it was more les than wv . definitely not a good date spot . i suggest barrio chino over this spot ! 
i enjoy pierre ' s deli . the food is always consistent ! if you are looking for a quick bite to eat at a reasonable price this is the place to go . i like it because it always taste the same , it is not like other places where N day its great and the next its mediocre at best . only problem is try and avoid the early morning breakfast and midday lunch rush otherwise be prepared to wait ! 
soo much food and although it ' s a rodizio ( meaning it ' s probably gonna be over N , that ' s probably the most well worth carnivorous meal you ' ll probably have in a while ) . came here with a group of friends . the rodizio comes with a buffet , which has loads of portuguese and brazilian specialties ( bacalhau , feijoada , etc . ) . but it ' s about the meat ! filet mignon , spicy chicken , slacks of ribs . . . all served to you by the second . that ' s service everyone was happy , except because we were college students , the bill was as massive as antarctica . but hey , its all about the food . . . it ' s all about the food . 
best greek food i ' ve had since i lived in europe ! this place has the atmosphere , great service , and awesome prizes ! ! ! i would definitely send any and all friends there ! ! not to mention go again whenever chance ( and economy ) permits ! ! ! 
trumbull kitchen is my all time favorite restaurant , but i unfortunately live in detroit . my boyfriend lived across the street and when i would visit we would go to trumbull N out of the N nights . the curried noodle appetizer and calamari the best i ' ve ever had , and the hanger steak was always perfect . i miss trumbull and its mojito ' s so much ! 
doesn ' t take credit card
lovely little spot in nolita . we stumbled upon it by chance and really enjoyed the food . everything in the menu looked so good that it took us a while to decide what to order . we ended up with really fresh salads and delicious pasta . we didn ' t order the burger though it ' s supposed to be very tasty ( they have an award for it ) . the place seems to be a spot for the models working in the studios nearby so it makes it quite an experience . 
i did not love this place , and i went on a cold rainy day when ramen should ' ve hit the spot ( it ' s your typical cramped , no frills ramen shop with quick service and a straightforward menu . i had the spicy basic which is a hot , pork based broth . maybe it ' s my personal preference , but the broth wasn ' t salty enough and actually tasted kind of chalky . the egg was hard boiled , while i prefer it soft . on the bright side , the sun noodles were excellent and the fatty pork was appreciated although it could ' ve been seared . if all those things sound good , this is the place for you . if not , there will be a seat at the bar because i probably won ' t be coming back . 
huge paesano ' s fan welcome to the shore . lunch will never be the same . worth the trip to bring them back to the beach . best sandwiches in town . 
don pepe is hands down the best in the city . eat the baked clams and you ' ve done your piece on earth . . the liguine , the veal " best in the city " best of all you can write a book about the joint and there are some great stories in the N years i ' ve gone there . along with the great food you cant help it but come back . i was even warned that if i didnt bring don pepe back to fla dont come home . my friend at the door yells out " tell her i got yuz covered " 
this restaurant is a home run ! my wife and i like it so much that we wound up having my son ' s Nst birthday party there . they did a great job ! the food and service made it a memorable experience for all who attended . great job ! ! 
pros muthu - the owner is a jolly fellow who is very attentive and engaging wide variety of made-to-order dosas - which is great for a cart if you like spice - muthu can really kick it up a notch offers traditional and ' westernized ' version of dosas cons for a cart , N-N for dosas is pretty steep his dosas are slightly thicker than what most people may be used to ( think paper dosa - this is about twice as thick ) - it also loses the crispiness - this can be a pro as well depending on your taste preference all and all , a very enjoyable experience of picking up some steaming dosas ( mine was turbo spiced up ) and sitting across the washington square park arc . 
this is the most authentic cantonese-style noodle , congee . . . etc . restaurant in all of manhattan . the atmosphere is relaxing , the service is beyond belief , and the food is just simply amazing . the food has the highest quality ingredients and the freshest choice of meat , seafood , and vegetables . this place is inexpensive when compared to other restaurants in the city considering what you get for your money . for example , the noodle soup is only N . N with jumbo fresh shrimp in the wonton and dumpling . i highly recommend you to try this place out and judge for yourself whether you think this is worth it or not . my family and friends loved the food ! ! ! 
went to ngam tonight with two friends . overall , i really love this restaurant . i ' d eat everything on the menu . not at once , but everything looks so good , so it makes me want to return to try new things . this makes me happy . i love loving menus . presentation decor- loved that some of the dishes are served on small slabs of what seems to be tree trunks . industrial sweet , with cute quotes on the wall from julia child . . . . still don ' t get this but oh well . a little bit random . they have communal tables , where about half the diners sit . don ' t love this but it seems to be a big trend . if you sit at the communal table there is no place to put your jacket and bag which is unfortunate for everyone and everyone ' s belongings . my friend also kept getting bumped into by the waiter while sitting at the communal table , maybe in part because the stools have no backs . the food ? chicken wings so , so delicious , sweet and spicy . came with N pieces ( N were drumsticks ) , decent size portion for N at an upscale casual restaurant . would have loved more sauce with it . zucchini pad thai my friends ordered it and loved it . good portion for a meal , and filling despite being vegetables . an awesome " healthy " option as there are no carbs . pad thai with long , thin strips of zucchini instead of noodles . pumpkin curry curry is served in a small cast iron saucepan ( size was small to me ) with a side of rice ( portion also seemed small ) . i asked our waiter about the size of the dish and the exact contents beforehand but he didn ' t do a great job of explaining . dish was tasty , but there were so many chili peppers and pieces of basil that i left floating in the rest of the curry and only about N small chunks of squash . this is not a portion to order and take home the rest . i finished it all and was full , but at most thai restaurants for dinner i always take home leftovers . our waiter spoke almost no english and didn ' t understand any questions we asked . i think this was just bad luck as another woman came by to take our order right after he took ours and she was very clear . make sure to ask another waiter if you have questions . as we were about to leave the restaurant , two of our friends came in and raved about how much they love the place , and that they visit ngam all of the time . 
came here for brunch - the brunch menu is regular american fare with a smattering of mediterranean dishes . i think the prices are ok and the service is good but all in all the food was just a-ok . nothing to write back home to mommy about . while i liked the ambience of the place , i dont think i will be coming back anytime soon . 
i ' ve discovered a winning formula for charlie brown ' s that works every time ! first , i place my order for a prime rib entree and then enjoy the delicious and fresh all-you-can eat salad bar . some of my favorite salad bar items are the beets , sunflower seeds and fresh croutons . there are a wealth of other exciting salad bar options . the prime rib is always delicious and juicy . service at charlie brown ' s of east windsor is friendly and efficient . it ' s also a good place to bring kids . if you use foursquare - i strongly recommend checking in at charlie browns . the past two times doing so , i was offered a free appetizer that can be redeemed on the spot ! 
the falafels here were very tasty . i got the mixed falafel platter and wasn ' t disappointed by anything on the plate . the falafels were all cooked very well and didn ' t seem nearly as greasy as the falafels i ' ve had before . the presentation was also quite impressive given the scale of this restaurant . everything about this place seemed very clean . my only complaint is the size of the place . there are only six barstools at the window and it gets very crowded inside due to popularity . 
i ' ve been going here for years and it continues to be a great restaurant . the burger , mussels , salads , and steaks are all great . the menu changes daily and is seasonlly sppropriate . 
i had been spoiled by organic food while living in california and missed it dearly . love this place . had the salmon burger and peanut smoothie . amazing ! ! ! service was great too other notes - juice bar - no fried food - organic centric - reasonably priced ( N for a salmon burger ) 
first things first , not receiving good service puts a damper on the entire meal and the mood at the table . i was not overly impressed with any of the meals that came out . the fried chicken with red velvet waffles , were not hot and maybe it ' s me , but it ' s hard for me to wrap my mind around expensive fried chicken . there is nothing you can do to make fried chicken an expensive meal , not even drop it next to a red velvet waffle . sorry . i may be a bit biased , being from the south . i think all the sides were pretty good though . the red beans and rice and the mac and cheese were the redeeming factors on our plates . on a positive note , the place was really cute . next time i would head out there for drinks and grab an appetizer or a couple of the side dishes . 
i heard of this tiny store from food network . guy fieri said it was one of the best things he ever ate , so i decided to check it out . i never noticed this store before , but i decided to try it . i tried the noodle soup with beef and it was delicious . i put some cilantro in and it tasted even better . the beef was extremely tender and the broth was to die for ! the dumplings are average , but still good . i also came back and ordered pan fried noodles and it was the best ! ( pan fried noodles are what guy fieri ordered ) the vegetables are a little bitter , but the noodles were crunchy and soft to the perfect conbination . i ordered it with pork chop , but they only gave you little bits of meat . . . the store is really small , and the decor is really poor . the service is okay , but not great . it ' s a casual place , but a little dirty . i would definally come back jsut for the food though . and its never crowded . they serve free tap water in foam plastic cups , that just shows how cheap this place is . thew other drinks come in bottles like coke , coconut milk , etc . 
had coffee at the fine grind . a medium coffee came in a huge mug , at least N ounces , maybe N . unfortunately to make up for the size , they brewed the coffese too weakly . i believe that drip coffee can only be good if it is strong . that way you get more coffee flavor with less acid bitter flavors . i was expecting better since nj monthly made it a critcs pick . then i had a pastry . all of it looked like factory pastries . for example , one pastry was called tollicious pie . it appeared to be toll house chocolate chip cookie batter plopped down into a pie crust and then baked . so when i don t trust the pastries , i order the cheesecake . also factory made ( jimmies in clifton according to the manager ) with a gummy crust . 
on our way to the tory burch store my friend told me how people come here for the corn . i ' ve never had cheese and lime on grilled corn before . i love grilled corn cheese separately so i ordered one and it was the best corn i ' ve ever had ! and at only N i ' m always going to come here whenever i go shopping . 
this was the most amazing food ! ! the service was wonderful . the chef owner and his wife are just delightful and extremely gracious . we were treated like royalty the entire night . one member of our party has celiac disease and the chef came out to make sure that her needs were accommodated . the food matched the welcome we started the night with a wonderful complimentary treat from the chef- a delightfully crisp crab cake . . everything was delicious , especially the vegetable terrine appetizer . the seared scallop and shitake mushroom risotto also did not disappoint . but one of the best treats of the night was the pistachio chocolate creme brulee . i am already planning our next visit . this is one of the best places in the area . 
great " lock " back yard , which is a great name for the bar , but you don ' t know it until you go in . it is great for a date , ( sit by the fake fireplace ) and a meeting with friends ( big picnic tables ) . i hope they keep the backyard open as long as the weather holds out . the outdoors is a special treat , the gas heaters really keep it comfortable . the decor is rustic , purposely done that way with a pipe for a " tp " holder in the bathroom . the design is genus as long as they keep it clean ! try the beers on tap , they are fabulous , my friend was not a big fan of his canned beer , even though it is artisan variety . i like the serving size , so you can try two beers without getting too full . the beer prices are always a happy hour price , how can you go wrong at N dollars a beer ? fabulous ideas in the menu , they even have vegan brat choices , be aware that the vegan choice is not gluten free if that is important to you , instead try the falafel it is great ! . be aware that their menu is a little different than on the website , which they warn might change . great service , they really care if you are warm and if you are happy with your food . the forks and knives are wood , probably reclaimed recycled . very little plastic waste , so the owners are thinking environmental and low waste . we should all be impressed with that alone ! parking is easy after Npm unlike some spots in bay ridge . 
this is a N star place . love the sandwich here . nice atmosphere consider a place in this neighborhood where you can get an affordable meal in a busy day . noodle soup is always served at the right temperature - unlike some other places where the soup is " just warm " and makes you wonder if the meat can be cooked . highly recommended
this is hands down the absolute best sushi i ' ve ever had ! once you go you won ' t want to go to any other sushi place again . my boyfriend and i are weekly regulars . very friendly staff , best presentation i ' ve ever seen and everything is always fresh . my personal recommendations are the shogun roll , philadelphia roll and yankee roll . those are my favorites . . . . . so far . for those who are unaware it ' s byob . 
here with a group of six , wife and adult children with friends . shared everything . everything was awesome . no disappointments . good spanish wines . great atmosphere . came here years ago when our son was attending upenn , so fun to be back and glad to see it is still so good . highly recommend . 
everyone loves pizza . and why not eat at the first and best ? lombardi ' s is the first pizza in the united states . their original location was about a block away from where they are now . they closed and reopned several years later at this location . must say that the pizza is great . they use a coal overn . my favorite part about the pizza is the sauce . its fantastic . only downside ? a bit expensive for pizza , but hey , it is wonderful . i believe this estabilshment is cash only . 
i ' ve been to shots a bunch of times , and the food is always great . and the portions are huge . i had a chicken quesadilla that i swore the bar had to lose money on because there was so much cheese and chicken . on another order , not sure if the cook messed up or what , but my order of mini sliders looked like N full size cheeseburgers . there always seems to be drink specials too , both during lunch and weeknights . i would like a better bathroom set up ( which may not be anyone ' s fault because it was packed that night ) , but other than that , everything is always top notch . definitely going to continue coming back . 
awesome place to stop by for any thing , big breakfast plate it ' s great , there bagels are out standing ! egg , bacon , and lox all day ! service is really friendly . outstanding
i was eating lunch in the area and my friend happened to bring me here . i love chinese food so i was like heck yea . she recommended the soup dumpling which was amazing . it was so juicy , i think i might have had at least N . i had rice cake for the first time and i loved it . the only problem was after we left the restaurant , we both had food comma . if i ' m in chinatown again , i would definitely stop by again . 
i went here with a friend as she works nearby but i can ' t say we were utterly pleased . we ordered some potato pancakes and they were nothing like i ' ve ever tasted before in a potato pancake ( and not in a good way ) . it was a bit bland i must say . the rest of the food was good , but nothing to write home about . i think the biggest problem i was having with the place was the design of the interior . the place was confused if it was a diner or a modern lounge . comfort food just doesn ' t fit into that somehow . 
this place is good for breakfast . the neighboorhood isnt that fancy . they have a very tasteful meediterrian breakfast platter . their turkish tea is always fresh and hot . but they should get a tea pot so the waiter doesn ' t have to come up to the table every N mins . also if you are turkish soccer fan this place is spot . they broadcast turkish super leagues games . the server i dnt know her name , but she was croatian . she was very nice and friendly . she is very good server . overall the bahche is very recommandable . . 
i wrote a review of the chambers street location back in november , finding it to be a depressing hole in the wall where happiness goes to die . well , those weren ' t my exact words , but that ' s the impression i got as a customer . i ' m thrilled to say that the william street location is a vastly different experience--bright , cheerful and staffed by workers who don ' t look like they ' re currently getting zapped by shock collars . as before i went with the house blend , served up by a personable guy at the counter . i even witnessed him troubleshooting an issue with a customer--the chili supply had run dry--and it appeared to be a very positive affair . my lunch was the goat cheese panini , and i completely enjoyed it . creamy goat cheese , tart roasted red peppers and a crisp panini bread with just a hint of balsamic was a winner . my only gripe is that , unless you ' re ordering just coffee , there isn ' t any place to stand and wait . i crammed myself by the sugar and milk station , hanging by the red phone on the counter ( so that ' s what happened to the hotline to the kremlin after the end of the cold war ! ) . but , hey , this is manhattan and space is at a premium anyway . in my visit to the chambers street hovel , they said that the owner loved the william street location and gave that more attention . it was obvious that the latter locale is a better place , and worth the four-star review . 
an off-the-main-streets gold nugget , a N minute walk from times square - in a noisy and crowded basement . N minutes waiting in line , but the high number of japanese people in the line and the staff made us stay and keep hoping for some authentic japanese ramen - and we were not disappointed ! the menu was bare bones with just N-N different ramen dishes , some sides and drinks - but that ' s how i like it ! quality over quantity . the ramen was extraordinarily good , perfectly cooked noodles and rich and tasty bouillon . the one bad thing about the place was that there were almost no bottled drinks - no mineral water whatsoever ! - and the water they serve in glasses have ice in them made of tap water which makes the drink taste of chlorine within a minute ! i hate that with a passion . as soon as you seem to be done with your food they come and pick up the dishes , signaling that it ' s time for you to leave and leave the seat for a new customer - something you appreciate when you ' re the one waiting in line , but not when you ' re the one sitting and having a nice conversation while sipping the last of your japanese beer . . . still , i ' ll be coming back . bring someone to talk to , or your nintendo ds - you ' ll be waiting in line the better half of an hour ! 
love it usually go at least N times a week . my favorites are chipirones en su tinta , cochinillo ( when available ) , pinchos morrunos , croquetas and basically anything you try will be amazing . definitely one of the best genuine tapas place in nyc . so happy its N block away from my house . 
if you want a place with no-frills , but cheap and tasty vietnamese food , with efficient service , this is the place to go . the grilled sirloin beef cubes ( don ' t know the dish ' s actual name ) and the beef wrapped in grape leaf appetizer have been consistently good . although the pho is not the best i ' ve had , it is tasty and comes in huge bowls . the grilled chicken on rice is very good too . generally , i ' ve found their vegetable dishes good . if you ' re a little adventurous , try their fried frog legs . it ' s also nice that the waitstaff is generally nice and efficient . 
we frequent the os and have always been happy with the service and the food is amazing . my only reservation about coming is whether we have the kids or not . it ' s a much better place for " date night " than a family outing . 
quiet place , nice interior . staff is friendly , fast and helpful . soup is good . i had chicken francese with linguine . which was pretty good , considering most diners make lousy pasta dishes . definitely would go again . 
the food is pretty good and the price is very reasonable . we tried the black squid ink linguine with seafood , the rigatoni ficaccua and risotto with shrimp . the linguine dish had tons of seafood on it and it tasted the best . next is the rigatoni . the sauce was very rich and creamy . love it . the risotto dish is alright but i feel the risotto was overcooked and the N shrimps that i had were also slightly overcooked as well . not crazy about that dish and won ' t be ordering that again . 
get the mac and cheese . get the mac and cheese . get the mac and cheese . i hope i ' ve made my point . oh , and add in a cookie . had i stuck to the amazing mac and cheese , this would be a N star review . i branched out the other day and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich . the bread that they used is all wrong for grilled cheese . it was a sweet , dense bread with various nuts . i maybe ate half of my sandwich . the grilled cheese comes with a tomato soup . the soup is a bit chunky in texture ( almost salsa like ) and tastes vegan . i ' m more of a creamy tomato soup girl myself . the sandwich was a waste of money and calories . the macaroni and cheese , however , i ' d spend all day walking around manhattan to burn off those calories and make room in my belly for more . i honestly had it for lunch and dinner yesterday . i was out of the city for a month and missed this mac and cheese like crazy . it has just the right amount of cheese - it ' s not swimming in some flour-based , gelatinous , fake orange sauce . i ' m usually not a fan of breadcrumb toppings , but this stuff is topped with just the right amount of wonderfully seasoned crumbs . it ' s going to be a struggle to not eat it again today . get a cookie . the chocolate chips are gooey throughout the cookie , even with the cookie at room temp . the cookie has a delicate balance of crunchy to soft texture . it very well may be the best cookie i ' ve ever had - and i passed up cheesecake yesterday to eat more of these cookies . mac and cheese with a cookie will set you back Nish . the mac and cheese , for me , is a big enough order for N meals . 
great food ! ! 
not being familiar with princeton , we asked a local business owner for an indian restaurant recommendation . she suggested mehek and we went in for the sunday lunch buffet . while the offerings were typical of a standard indian buffet ( and , there was a good selection of vegetarian options ) the quality was poor . although the chafing dishes were lit , when we took our first bites , we realized that the food was all luke warm - cold . i refrained from eating much of the chicken items for fear of getting sick . the vegetable pakora was cold and rubbery and the curry sauces were thin . the naan was warm when it was delivered and much of my meal consisted of this . sevice was not great . even when it was clear that we had finished , our waiter remained seated at a table behind us , doing side work . we wound up calculating our own tab and leaving the money on the table . seems like this place has received mixed reviews . maybe it ' s better during the week , but i would personally not go back . 
i dare you to be able to finish a serving of thg ' s foods . the portions are huge and for only N , it ' s the best food deal in manhattan . i had the gyro meat over rice with white sauce . the dish was hot , fresh and very tasty . there was no way i could finish it all though , even after spending several hours walking around nyc and working up quite an appetite . and as a side note , take caution about the hot sauce . it is extremely hot ! 
super clean and tastefully decorated . went and tried all the empanadas , sandwiches de miga and pizza . one word- outstanding ! ! ! but to me could be dangerous , seeing im only ten minutes away and empanadas are my weakness . . . took all the food to my folks house for their anniversary - to hear my dad say- omg the empanadas are the way my abuela use to make- well it says it all ! ! the miga sandwiches were better than a cafe in buenos aires ! and the pizza . . . brings me back home ! ! gus ( gustavo ) was friendly , genuine and down to earth ! ! we spoke for some time and made me feel that we had known each other for years ! ! like my best friend ! that and the spectacular food , well , i will be gaining a few extra pounds . a side note as i left i dropped my credit card in the parking lot , his next door business neighbor brought it in to gus and he called me right away to let me know he had it . that tells me - really good people ! ! so , excellent food , excellent people , and excellent local . . . no wonder i fell in love with the place . don ' t miss it ! ! ! vamos argentina carajo ! ! ! 
do not make any large orders from this restaurant . they are extremely unprofessional . we ordered a N lunch order for a business meeting , it was not until i called N minutes after the order was supposed to be delivered that their rude employee told me they decided not to fill the order . their food may be good , but they ' ll never be able to handle anything more than " falafel cart " style traffic . do not rely on for catering or large orders ! ! ! ! ! 
the best things i ate here were the ribs ( N N rack with two sides N . N or a whole rack with N sides N . N ) and the chocolate peanut butter pie . generally sides are my favorite and i enjoyed the mac and cheese as well as the turkey neck greens however , i would not recommend the black eyed peas with kale or the bbq beans with pork . i don ' t know what really went wrong with these two side dishes but there was a consensus at our foodie table of four that they were not good eats . we also had the pork sandwich platter with two sides N . N . the pulled pork sandwich was good , but the ribs are what really make this place worth it . 
weird place . slow service
it is a very good japanese restaurant ) i loved it ! i loved the interior decoration , and the precipitation of the food . they serve authentic japanese food , and they have a good selection of sake ) ! i love my sake ! and i am so glad that i found this place ! 
food and service are great ! ! ! 
don ' t be scurred to walk into this place . the noodles are as fresh as they come when you see the guy slap and twist and hand pull your dinner right in front of you . the broth is okay so i just come for the fresh noodles . it ' s right around the corner from me so it ' s easy when i need my niu rou mien fix . can ' t beat the N . N price . dumplings are okay . 
i am pleased to say i was not disappointed . the decor is clean and modern , while still keeping a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere . that topped with the friendly service is a recipe for success ! popeye delight sandwich - wonderfully delicious . i have tried many of their dishes and have loved everything . i will continue eating here . really good service too . ps the service is impeccable , genuine service attitude and attentiveness . 
eco bean and juice is most natural juice bar around town . each drink is thoughtfully made to perfection . relaxed , modern space with free wifi . imagine a better starbucks that ' s local and has great staff . 
great service , cool decors , convenient location , delicious guacamole . i gotta say it was probably most fresh chunky guacamole that i ' ve ever tasted . i ordered enchiladas with mole sauce and it was great . it was my first time trying the mole sauce and it was interesting chocolate-based sauce that went well with everything else on the plate . it would ' ve been nice if there was more rice , though . it might be little more than other mexican restaurants but it ' s a must-try restaurant on south st . ) 
 . the fried chicken was really not that good---popeyes is better lol . the sides were also pretty plain . it wasnt just me b c the person i went with also wasnt diggin it . the first time i went here and i ordered take-out , the hipster girl that gave me my food gave me the hipster attitude so that wasnt so cool . anyway , this place is for hipsters that want fake soul food . 
everything is delicious at the villa . its one of the best places around . i ' m glad they decided to open . 
the service is like the service at any other place in chinatown - not good . but the food is great ! definitely come with a group , so you can eat family style and sample a little of everything . joe shanghai is not as vegetarian friendly as other chinese restaurants , but it ' s still good . my friends and i ordered some fried noodles with vegetables , an eggplant dish without the pork , turnip cakes , veggie duck , and soup dumplings ( no vegetarian option here ) . the only dish i wouldn ' t recommend was the veggie duck . we ordered it based on a favorable review that was hanging on the window outside . definitely could have passed on that one . everything else was delicious , and the sauces for the noodles and eggplant were super tasty . a little oily , but dude , it ' s chinese food . man , writing about this is making me hungry . 
this is the most phenomenal-tasting frozen yogurt i have ever had ! ! they have a great selection of flavors , and mixing those flavors gives limitless possibilities . the place was exceptionally clean , and all the toppings were fresh and well-prepared . the staff was friendly , courteous and helpful . they have free wi-fi , lots of room and comfortable seating , so you can kick back and study or just chill . i don ' t know how they could improve on this store -- this is yogurt done right ! i will be back ! ! 
my favorite weekend noodle place . quick convenient and the noodles are so good ! 
this is hands down my favorite restaurant in the city ! the food is incredible ! i have lived both in italy and in greece , countries that are well known for their exquisite cuisine , and i have learned to distinguish fresh , quality dishes . malatesta has delicious , traditional italian food that in combination with a relaxing environment makes for a perfect place for dinner . my favorite dishes are spinache gnocchi , cheese ravioli and chicken cutlet . its also nice and clean which makes all the difference . enjoy ) 
for sandwiches or hot food along orange street , this market is the clear winner for any meal of the day ! there ' s huge variety to the menu , and the food is always fresh . the folks behind the counter are friendly , the prices are competitive , and the portions are generous . the east rocker sandwich is the best sandwich i ' ve had in new haven . 
after trying out halal bros in austin , i was a bit intrigued with how the supposed original place was . on the way here , i couldn ' t help but notice how there ' s about N or N other halal places on every corner but nobody seems to pay much attention to them . finally hit the corner where halal guys was and goooolly there was a crazy line . need i mention that it was raining too ? ? but that didn ' t seem to stop anyone from coming here . sooo since we already walked this way , we might as well line up anyways ! the food is cooked fresh right there . they have a great system going with one guy doing the cooking , the other guy taking orders and the other guy packing up the food . i got the lamb over rice , N for a huge platter of foood ! we shared this between N people . there was sooo much rice and meat ! ! it also came with pita bread which was perfectly soft . the white sauce was legit ! it had a great flavor that perfectly complimented the meat and the rice . the rice had a great flavor . the chili sauce was gooood ! ! ! it was some homemade chili sauce with true spice ! totally worth the wait . if you ' re coming here late at night , i ' m sure it would even be Nx better ! comparing this to halal bros in austin . . . it ' s not a comparison ! the one there had wayy too much cumin on the rice and the white sauce was wayy too tangy and the chili sauce was basically like the asian chili garlic sauce blah ! now i ' ll only be satisfied if i come here and get the real deal ! 
reservation N Np , getting seated at N Np with huge crowd at the door . very affordable but not worth it for sure . 
randomly walked into this place and i was surprised with the ramen--great ! 
the best pizza ever ! ! ! ! the crust is amazing all the variety you want . the staff is great too . love it . 
worst place ever . staff is rude and just act as though you are bothering them . . . i went with a gift card and was told i was unable to use it on take out . what thats crazy why would i not have the option to eat there or take it home . the man at the front counter was rude and tried to make me look foolish . i will never go there again and am telling everyone i know to do the same . there is a great place in montclair , or just about anywhere is better then this place . dont waste your time . 
family friendly atmosphere and menu made dining out in the city something my kids actually enjoyed . bowls of their favorite cereals and some cotton candy were both a big hit . the staff was very helpful and got me a table without a reservation in a packed saturday night . definitely a " go to " family dining spot . 
food is still great but the service is lacking more with each visit . 
after many times in greece you can recognize really ( ! ) good , genuine mediterranean food . great experience , great service . if you have not tried it , you should . we will definitely go again . great addition to the flatiron district . . . . . 
i invited my fianc for dinner before theater i choose this place because of the good reviews but i was very disappointed about the service and food quality i order house salad , chicken parmigiana that was only bread , the rigatoni vodka was watery lack in sauce i could do better vodka sauce , the waiter never ask me how was my food only came twice to take my order and give me the check . i wil not recommend this place to my friends . 
wooow wow ! i am continuously impressed with getting dinner at this hole in the wall spot in china town . last night i took my parents for their first time and we were all blown away with the quality of the food and how quickly it came out , nothing new here . we got our usual order pan fried pork dumplings , fried wontons , garlic green beans , salt bake jumpo shrimp ( ask for no shells ) , walknut shrimp , chicken ho-fun with bean sauce . . . . and something new ! which blew my mind . i asked our waitress for her opinion on the best fish dish to which she goes , " oh ! ok , ok , i know . " within ten minutes out came a whole , steamed sea bass that was sitting in the most delicious ginger , soy sauce . i have never been so happy and i am already craving it again . i could come for just this once a week . . . . and probably will ! happy eating ! 
the best sangria ever . this is my absolute favorite tapas restaurant ever ! i recommend the octopus , and the hijo y madre . the lobster paella was also amazing ! 
i really liked the atmosphere at quaint but was thoroughly underwhelmed by the food . though i appreciate the local sourcing and seasonal ingredients , my meal was just lacking in the flavor department . i went with a friend and together we ordered the cod and salmon entrees , along with the mesclun salad as our appetizer . i could tell that the ingredients were fresh , at least the tomatoes were- slightly crisp and sweet . the service was polite and i really enjoyed the quaint ( ha ! pun intended ) and romantic feel of the backyard that was decorated with tiny string lights and white furniture , but were not enough to overpower the bland food . 
their cheeses and house-roasted turkey are delish ! the employees are very friendly as well . their hours make it a bit tough to get here if you work , but it ' s worth it if you can make it ! 
this place is awesome . i came for karaoke night . . . albeit accidentally , and had sooo much fun . the crowd is delightedly diverse and the drinks are great as is the bottled beer selection . the prices are very reasonable as well . i will definitely be going back again . 
love their food ! the crepes are fantastic . each savory crepe i ' ve had tastes here like the best one i ' ve ever eaten . no question about it - you will feel the same way too . i ' m always trying to bring people here to eat with me . it ' s a cute place . very quaint and charming . the servers are very nice and usually speak to you in french , if you like that sort of thing . i also take food to go , and they ' ve never messed up once , which to me says a lot of about the place . they are in general very attentive and customer service oriented . only once did they forget to put in an order for dessert and we were waiting N min . outside at a table before they realized we were waiting for something . sadly , we were the only people outside , so they simply forgot about us . that ' s why i ' ve taken a star away . 
i remember being in town shortly after audrey claire opened this charming corner bistro and essentially jumpstarted the whole byob boom in philly . some great food memories from that virgin meal the roast chicken w pomegranate molasses and some amazing mussels . it was terribly noisy back then as it is still today , but the quality of the cooking more than made up for it . not so much the case now . . . have been there twice in the past year and both times was completely underwhelmed with the poor service , over- or undercooked entrees , and food that ' s nothing to write home about . too bad . . . i really wanted to root for this one , but food ' s just not up to snuff for the buzz
food is great and you even get a cigar at the end of your meal ! 
we go here a lot for breakfast , some of the best pancakes ever and at a reasonable price . the owner ' s now know our faces and always come and say hello . the only down side to this restaurant is that they do not have wifi . it would be nice to have because we are students and would like to bring our laptop for a while . unh students get N off with school id which is great ! ! 
service was awful and we waited a very long time for food and drinks . waited at the bar for our table and while there were only N people at the bar , we had to wait N minutes to get a drink . the server didn ' t come to the table until we had been seated for over N minutes . the drinks we ordered from him never came until we asked him again . our tapas came out N minutes after we ordered . . but only one order was correct . we waited another N minutes for the second tapa . our paellas came out over an hour after we ordered and unfortunately , the rice wasn ' t even cooked . there was actually a puddle of water at the bottom of the pan which showed the rice hadn ' t fully absorbed it . but even if the rice were cooked , the dish didn ' t have any taste and was very bland . i definitely wouldn ' t go back . if you must go , the rock and roll shrimp tapa was excellent . 
cheap , filling , spicy food in a no-pretensions atmosphere . and always a good sign when an ethnic eatery in manhattan has several patrons of that same ethnicity . i only wish that there was one in my nabe ! 
great atmosphere - just like a favourite brasserie in paris except the service here was polite and helpful ( unlike parisians ! ) with thought through recommendations tailored to their take on me . i had the trout followed by a sorbet - just what i wanted for a light supper - the fish was perfectly cooked with balanced herbs that complemented and enhanced the mango sorbet was refreshing and cleansing . highly recommended . 
if you ' re open to something a bit different than your typical nyc style pizza then this place is totally worth it ! it ' s one of my faves ( next to lombardis and my little pizzeria and mi famiglia ) . the fresh mozzarella , the basil , and yummy sauce on thin crust is delicious . not too pricey either , it ' s about the same price range as any other pie would be in nyc . the long line waiting is worth it . i always find it a wonderful treat to eat at grimaldis ) 
i love this place ! i don ' t like the area it ' s in , but i love the food . pizza is great ! simple salad with chicken is awesome . but my absolute favorite is their eggplant parm on a hard roll for N ! fat sandwich with just enough sauce to coat the bread without making it soggy and dripping wet . . eggplant is fried to perfection and still a little crisp in the sand . . excuse me sangwiche . wash it all down with some foxon park and you have got a home run . when in season , the fresh tomato pie with pesto is killer ! best white clam in ct hands down . pane cotta is the way i like it , crisp not soggy . you all can wait in line on wooster st , that ' s fine . not knocking their pies , but it hasn ' t been quite the same down there for some time . . . that ' s just my taste buds . judging by the long lines , there doing just fine without my . all the best to them . parking . . . to be honest , i pull in back and run in and out . never a problem unless grand ave is backed up or the bridge is up . 
this is one of the best tapas places in the city . i just took my parents there for christmas eve dinner and they loved it ! this is what we got bacon wrap with dates - this is really really good ! has a hint of sweetness lamb meatballs - pretty good , the sauce just makes the lamb flavor pop brussels sprouts - this is a must get here mushroom risotto - it ' s okay , too bad they don ' t have seafood version shrimp crab avocado - this was my mom ' s favorite . so pretty and tastes amazing paella - this is also a must get grilled octopus salad - this was alright , i thought the octopus was a bit over cooked skirt steak - amazingly tender , love that sauce and the potato puree that come with it shrimp chorizo skewer - pretty good panna cotta - sooo good ! ! ! extremely smooth . . . love it ! creme broulee - these are very small , about the size of a quarter . it ' s alright . i prefer the normal size cream broulee , not these petites all in all , we had a great time here . the service was also really good . everyone was really nice . one thing to note is that they only take cash or amex . regardless , we love it ! will definitely come back ) 
i went to hearth for the first time this past weekend . everything was amazing ! the food , the wine , the service ! ! my group did the N course taster ' s menu , don ' t be afraid of the cost it was so worth it ! every course was amazing ! the service was great . they were polite and knowledgeable , and my water glass was never empty ! i never once had to ask for a refill . they are pricey so go there expecting to spend a little bit more , but i came away feeling it was worth every penny ! 
i just want to big up the brazilian people for blessing queens with churascarias . so far in my N years here this is the best buffet i ' ve been to in nyc . if you are ever in long island city astoria just shut up and go here for the restaurant flavor at buffet prices . the sides are pretty good like the bacalao , but really you just need to park yourself by the grill and grab a hot plate of the N meats they have to offer . the only challenge here is trying to order under N of food . 
i have been to mayfield several times now both for a bevvy and to have dinner . every time has been a hit for me . the food is fantastic but also , the bar guys know their stuff . i have asked for recommendations to match my food and they hit it on the head every time . the last time i went to mayfield i sat at the bar and got their burger . it was nothing short of phenomenal . i believe i said to the guy ' i ' m gonna yelp the shit outta this burger ' which he considered high praise indeed . 
i adore this place . i love that it ' s just a few blocks away from me . it feels like a secret- such a hidden gem , such oddball decor , so small intimate ! the food is great , although i feel like it keeps getting more more expensive ? so that ' s a little annoying , but it ' s so reliably good that i have to go back about once a month . if you live in the neighborhood , it ' s the perfect place to take friends company as a " unique to my area " kinda meal . not to mention , it ' s byob , which i always love . the thai cod curry ( although every time i ' ve been there lately , it ' s been tilapia- i guess cod ' s been out of season- which is still great , but a little more ) is amazing . people who say they want noodles or rice with it are out of their minds- and someone mentioned not liking the hidden scoop of mashed potato on the bottom of the bowl . that person is insane . get this dish , it ' s delicious . i agonize over what to get every time , because i ' ve tried pretty much everything , and it ' s all so good . the scallops dijonaise , the mustard-crusted salmon , the tuna burger , the salmon burger , the cioppino , the whole fish , the specials . . . ay yi yi , yum . i also love the appies fried oysters , tuna salmon carpaccio , mozzarella tomato salad , crab corn chowder- all winners . there ' s usually only one server working , so service can be a little slow when the restaurant is busy , but just chill out , man . drink your wine don ' t be a pushy jerk . also , some reviewers complain about having to sit up front- yeah , i suppose the back room is preferable more " romantic , " but i ' ve sat up front at least a couple of times , still had a great time . totally different ambiance , but still cool charming . in fact one of those times was with my boyfriend , and the back room was packed , and we were all alone in the front . completely romantic felt like our own private little french vacation ! one of the only bad things i can say is that about half of the times i ' ve been there , there ' s been a wait ( no big deal , it ' s tiny , so it ' s understandable ) we ' ve gone next door to the new wine bar , the flying lobster . the flying lobster is a great little place all , but i swear to god , four times we ' ve been there , and each time ( months apart ) , the bartender explained to us in the same words how they were having their soft opening would be open in two weeks . this happened for months ! ! and this bartender also talks talks talks talks talks talks . it ' s like , dude , at least pour my wine first before you launch into the prepared one-sided small talk that we ' ve heard so many times now ! ( i guess i should save this for my review of the flying lobster , but sometimes when you go to petite crevette , they are part of the same experience . ) 
good vietnamese food with out having to go to china town . i suggest getting the pork chop pho with the porkchop on the side . delish . 
this is my all time favorite place to eat . as soon as you walk in , you are immediately welcome with the sweet aroma of cuban food . the food is fantastic ( especially the plantains ) . the staff are so charming and polite . the restaurant is designed to mimic the feel of cuba and they did an outstanding job . especially when i ' m stumbling back to the car after a few sangrias ( not driving ) and realize that i ' m on bloomfield ave in montclair ) 
i ' ve been here for several times and the ramen here always amazes me ! ! i especially like the chicken shoyu and spicy tonkotsu . the taste of the chicken shoyu ( N ) is very unique . the broth contains the sweetness of chicken , and tastes very natural and flavorful . the noodle has good texture and goes well with the soft-boiled egg and seaweed ( nori ) that it comes with . spicy tonkotsu ( N ) is also my favorite ( actually i ' m addicted to it ) . the pork broth is creamy and goes so well with their home-made spicy sauce . the pork belly is marinated well and very decent . the server is very friendly and the decoration is very japanese . the best ramen place in philly for sure ! especially if you like spicy ! ! 
why is it so loud ? ! ! ? ! ? ! ? ! the place blasts club music like no other . . . at first i didn ' t mind , and thought it added to the atmosphere , but halfway through my meal it gave me a little bit of a headache . i suspect they do this to get customers in and out more quickly . if you don ' t want to deal with the music , and prefer a cozier environment , totto ramen ' s ramen is just as good . i came here at around Npm on a sunday , on a freezing winter day last week and the wait was only about N minutes . i love that customers are free to leave the restaurant , and they just text you when your table is ready . totto ramen can ' t compete in that regard . i had the hirata buns- you can ' t leave here until you try these ! the buns were so soft and perfect , the pork so tender , the sauce so flavorful . . . i could ' ve eaten N of these at once . . . the meal itself was as delicious as ramen gets . i had the akamaru modern with nitamago and bamboo shoots . i also ended up having the matcha brulee ( green tea flavored creme brulee topped with green tea gelato ) --if you like green tea flavor and you like creme brulee . . . . get it . 
the crust is perfect , it ' s thin but not crispy , and the cheese stretches when you take a bite . 
a delightful experience from beginning to end . courteous staff , a wonderful selection of wines , and an extensive menu contributed . our nonna rita prepared the most delicious pasta . while we waited for it to be prepared we were served complimentary appetizers . our main dishes arrived in a timely fashion and were amazing . my only regret is that had no room for dessert . next time ! 
during our recent trip to new york we dined here for sunday brunch . we had a variety of things from the chicken and red velvet waffles to the fque wings , mac and cheese , collard greens , an omelette and some other things as well but the overall table consensus was that the food was delish ! ! ! i nearly hurt myself trying to finish my collard greens . the wings were a bit spicy for my palette but i kept tring to eat them because the flavor was so good . complaints -i made open table reservations and it didnt mention that they close at N N for brunch ( our reservation was for N N ) it just would have made nice information . -by the time we were ready to order the waitress ( michelle-very cool ) informed us that several things on the menu were no longer available to choose from . N of which were things i was considering . . . total bummer ! 
i found this place the day before i was leaving new york city and it was my favorite thai restaurant ! the mojitos were fantastic , the apps were great , the pad thai was delicious ! yummmm i wish i was still living there so i could go again ! 
ducks eatery may be in soft opening mode , but this place is a phenomenal idea of creative food fusion that is going to be a great hit . fabulously made cocktails , great appetizers , and delicious shared plates . pickles and jerky are very tasty appetizers to try . chicken wings and ribs are both amazingly delicious . brisket night is phenomenal . menu continues to change vary depending on the week , with interesting and new creations specials every week to try . awesome vibe , music and decor in the restaurant , and outdoor seating on a gorgeous east village block - makes for a fun , relaxing and hip new york city dining experience . 
the food here was exquisite ! the attention to detail , and savory dishes make for an amazing dining experience . definitely check this place out ! 
absolutely amazing ! ! the homemade biscuits are to die for and the coffee served in the ole tin cups is well . . just stellar ! love you morning glory
best macarons i ' ve ever had ! seriously so good . i chose the box of N for N . N . you pick your own box , which is a little work of art to hold the delicious macaroons . i selected fleur de sal caramel coconut lemon verbena pistachio chocolate almond cherry the shop itself is adorable . the interior design is adorably classic parisian pastels , black and gold . the shop girls are quick and try to keep the line moving , so be prepared to be ushered through the process rather quickly . 
the only reason this did not get a N out of N is because the bartender was terrible . the waiter and food on the other hand were out of this world . we had a N minute wait for a table , and we were lucky enough to steal N seats at the bar for the wait . we proceeded to watch the bartender make drinks for the employees other tables until our table was called . it was literally N-N minutes that we were not approached . once that was out of the way - everything else was great . server was knowledgable , food was phenomenal . tables are not the roomiest , but it is a cozy environment . it will definitely be a spot i will go to again . 
i have been literally hundreds of times since they have been the last N yrs , the best solid good food in brooklyn heights . very consistent good food , the service used to be bad but has greatly improved and now is actually great . the owner is nice . the atmosphere is nice too , the music is perfect , not to loud . the only draw back if i had to pick one the deserts take to long and are to cake ' y . the ice cream is always creative though . 
i ' ve only been here once . when we first heard about this place , a friend and i were really jazzed to go check it out . we finally made it there early one rainy day for brunch . upon arrival we discovered there was quite a wait . apparently we were not alone in our ambition . fortunately , there is a waiting area with couches chairs and you can go to the counter and get coffee while you wait . we were given the option by the hostess to put our names in , but to also feel free to sit at the counter if space becomes available . we planned on holding out for a table , we waited a bit , a spot opened at the counter and we went for it . i ' m glad we did . ( it always makes me feel better poised for service when the employees are right in front of you ) . we ordered the kitchen sink , stuffed french toast , a side of chorizo grits . i love chorizo , so that was a great start . theirs was yummy . i had been dying to try the kitchen sink since i first read about it . it was good and all but i don ' t think i would get it again . kinda like a " been there , done that " thing . i would be eager to try something else from the menu on my next visit . overall , it was a good experience . good coffee , good food , clean cozy . i look forward to going back someday soon . i just discovered they opened a second location in nolibs . righteous . 
the atmosphere was fantastic , remember to try the sky bar ! cocktail selection was fun , food was good . my only compliant was the prices i feel the cocktails and portions were far too small for such premium prices . prepare to have fun . . . but at a cost . our server brian was fantastically friendly . 
worst pad thai ever ! ! no peanuts , no lime . just awful ! ! trust me i ' m not a picky person but this was the equivalent of ordering a cheeseburger and getting a pineapple . i called to complain and they said this is how they make it . well i guess you just lost a customer . take it off your menu unless you make it properly whats the point . i saw another thai food complaint on yelp , wish i read this first . 
i would like to start off by saying this was my first visit to egan ' s . as i enter the establishment i see a very pretty patio and i think to myself , wow this place must be nice should really come see it when its sunny and warm out . then i enter and i see a place that is large , very well lit and the decor was beautiful . . . and i think wow i ' m really feeling the ambiance . we sit at the bar and wait for the rest of our group to arrive . . . the week was long and we are all looking foward to letting our hair down and enjoy a few drinks and maybe a bite or too . the night starts off great . and then after several hours of us ordering a few rounds and some appetizers and meals ( approx . Nhrs ) things take a turn . upon returning from a N minute trip to the ladies room i return to my group to find one of my friends in a heated conversation witch i assumed to be with another patron . low and behold it was not a patron but a staff of the establishment ! and i ' m trying to figure out how could this happen in N minutes ? what could change my mild mannered friend from a happy patron to one so distraught ? my friend was asked to turn his hat around ( he was wearing it backwards ) . when asked why he was told it was a rule of the establishment . now this struck him as well as the rest of us , as very confusing . first of all we had been in the same spot for several hours and not one employee stated anything in regards to this policy as we ordered appetizers , meals and drinks ! ! as we question this we are told by another that the policy starts at Npm . . . again we question because at this point it was well past N . . . in fact pretty close to Npm . even now looking at this very website i see a picture of a patron with his hat on backwards . . . hmmm and it makes me think the patron in the photograph is white and my friend is not . . . i hate to think this but was there a different motive involved ? up until this incident we were all having a wonderful time . after spending considerable amounts of money this experience left us all on a sour note . so bad that we will not be returning . if this was truly a policy of the establishment you may want to consider a better way of making this " rule " known and if a more ugly reason is behind this . . . shame on you ! ! be all bleed the same color blood and the color of all our money is green ! ! ! ! 
went here to meet up with someone real quick for a beer , and ended up staying for more . this place is pretty cool inside and looks brand new . bunch of tv ' s around , friendly staff . and ufo on tap . this place , while a little far from home , will hold a place in my heart . they have ufo white and ufo raspberry ( wifey likes ) on tap . this is very rare . they also have a ton of other beers on tap . the prices aren ' t cheap , but the value seems good . they also have a back patio . more bonus points . i might not know where to park , but it looks like just street parking or risking it at the bank . will go again . 
whether for business or pleasure - always a great place . we ' ve tried most of the menu at some stage and loved almost every course . well worth a visit . 
too crowdy , very poor service . the food is not fresh . if you like to wait N minutes for some " authentic " margarita which is actually as good as wherever else then this place is for you . and - it ' s pricey . so make sure you have your cash ready . 
went here on N N N . . we arrived between N-N pm . . group of N . . celebrating a friends birthday . the wait for a table was N N hours at first . . only to be brought upstairs to wait another N N hour for a table . by the time we was seated it was about N pm . we ordered i ordered a cesar salad with grilled shrimp . . one friend didn ' t eat fish so she ordered fries ! ! everyone else ordered like a shrimp platter . . the food is overpriced n my shrimp were frozen and raw no seasoning one slice of lettuce n old looking croutons ! ! ! i sent it back ! ! and ordered more water ! ! the waitress never asked me was there anything else she could get me or nothing ! ! the shrimp thick with batter n rather large in size but they weren ' t cooked underneath no type of seasoning ! ! ! plain white once u take the breaking off of it ! ! ! one if my friends meal came after everyone else had already ate ! ! the place was very noisey not from the diners but from the staff ! ! less horseplay and more professionalism ! ! i gave a N star for location n view . . 
located at a questionable area . . . so stay safe the philly cheese steak with whiz . . . welp , honestly , i was disappointed . it was too chopped up and it didnt have enough cheese and toppings are additional - but it was cheap and it is definitely a ' locals ' thing . the hamburger was surprisingly the best thing that we ordered . . . and oh , the cheap beer also . thou shall not forget the beer ! ! ! the people inside were friendly also . they were talking smack with each other and that , well , that made me feel right at home ! haha . so , it ' s all good ) but in all honesty , is it really the best cheese steak ? nah , not really . we went out of our way to come here , and it really did not live up to the hype but all in all , not bad . 
amazing place , amazing pizza . 
one of my favorite places for thai food . i love the coconut rice and love the thai iced teas . always enjoy taking people to this place . i also like the neighborhood which has some neat authentic shops . . . like a thai grocery store nearby . 
pretty much perfect . honestly i was shocked we were able to get in at Npm with no reservation on a thurs . the best thing we had was the pappardelle ( sp ) . that said , everything was great . our server really went out of the way . he was great in general , but when we mentioned that we were from out of town he took the time to write out several recommendations for restaurants and bars for the rest of our visit . 
great wine , cool atmosphere , great bites , and great overal spot . 
incredible food , delicious drinks , and a great ambience . le barricou was definitely doing some business on sunday morning ( N N pm ) and the N minute wait to be seated reflected that . the meal was well worth that wait , though . the space is bustling and the walkways are tight , but there was a great vibe and some good tunes playing--all combining for an upbeat and warm atmosphere . the customers were a range of total hipsters , young families , and people who had just stumbled out of their caves to find some grub to fill them up while they re-hashed the previous evening ' s dance party . the bloody mary arrived in a mason jar , which was an auspicious start to our meal . the drink itself was fantastic--great consistency , lots of kick , and a nice balance of booze mixer . the eggs benedict that followed were some of the best i ' ve ever had . i chose bacon instead of ham and pomme frites instead of home fries , and the entire dish was an expert combination of flavors . the eggs were beautifully poached , with a runny yet velvety yolk . the bacon was fried to perfection , and the frites were full of flavor . the hollandaise sauce was killer . the small side of mixed greens was also a nice touch . the prices are totally reasonable , with most entrees costing N- N , though a bloody mary will run you about N . my only gripes are the teensie-tiny water glasses they give you and that it ' s a cash-only establishment . over all , though , i ' m a big fan . 
i love freddy and tony ' s on front and indiana . their food is always fresh and delicious . i ' ve eatten there many times and have never gotten sick . however , yesterday ( sunday ) , they were closed so we decided to order from the one on Nnd and allegheny . never again . several hours later i was sick to death . way over priced . we ordered a steak platter with two can sodas and two alcapurrias and were charged N . with N we could have gotten a large rice , steak , totones , two bottled sodas and two alcapurrias at front and indiana . my opinion . . . freddy and tony ' s front and indiana all day . freddy and tony ' s Nnd and allegheny not at all . . . 
great food , great ambiance . . . the staff definitely has a chip on their shoulder maybe , because of the quality of the restaurant , but if you can look past that it ' s a great experience . 
um , yes . yes . yes . yes . just . . . just go . things smarmy and i had here included scallops , which were tender and delightful and my personal fav the bacon wrapped dates with gorgonzola ( whoa mama . in some circles , these are known as devils on horseback . who would ever run from this devil ? ) pulled pork sliders , which were also super yummy , on tiny light fluffy brioches and at the rec of mr . smarmy , we had to get . . . the bacon doughnuts . save room for these sweet little things peppered with salty bacon . we split a bottle of tempranillo -- lots of very affordable options in the under N range -- and the waitress was spot on with a recommendation based on what we said we liked . the menu changes all the time , which is a sign of chevery at its best , always wanting to keep pace with new ingredients , what ' s fresh , what ' s best available . we ordered a few less than recommended by the waitress to share and it was a perfect fit . 
came here saturday night around N . the restaurant was packed both inside and out . we were seated near the front next to a large table of N . the first thing we both noticed was how loud it was . too loud . our server took our drink order shortly after we sat down and the chips salsa came after that . the chips are the best i ' ve had on the east coast , the green salsa is amazing and the red is delicious as well . the marg ' s were weak and the lime juice tasted off . we both ordered the tilapia taco special . they are loaded with yummy fillings . the chipolte sauce was perfect . i asked for mine spicy so they threw some jalepeno ' s on top . the order included N tacos , and it is a lot of food . i highly recommend , the tacos are by far , the best mecican food i ' ve had in pa . 
i am only giving N stars because of my most recent experience here , the first time we came for brunch in the summer , it was exceptional with seating outdoors . i had the red flannel hash and the bread and dip plate and all was great . . but last week , we went for lunch , the service and the food was underwhelming . . . the waiter took our order and forgot about us , people that came in after us were eating their meals . . we asked another waiter where our food was and he said there was a mix-up in the kitchen . . ok , that was fixed . . our bread and dip plate came and all i tasted was an overwhelming taste of curry . . . then i ordered my portobello sandwich , again " curry " . . i don ' t know what was going on . . . i really didn ' t like this whole meal . . the only good thing was that they gave us the appetizer for free because of the terrible service . . . 
good place in the city to get cheap korean food . the buffet can be pretty pricey so i do not recommend getting that . but i do love the lunch boxes and korean style desserts that they sell . 
went in for some coffee and pie . the coffee was decent . i ' d asked for the lemon meringue pie but sadly , they were all out . i thought it was weird because it was the middle of the day . they told me they had banana cream pie so i ordered that instead . it was just plain awful . it ' d tasted like whipped cream and banana pudding mixed together . there was more whipped cream than actual pie so that was a disappointment . and the banana cream tasted like it was about to expire . it was not creamy at all . just thick and rubbery like glue . my check came out to four dollars but i tipped my waitress a N because she looked like she was having an off day . 
went on a saturday afternoon . he had great service and an excellent meal . price was great . we were in no hurry and let the waiter know we were in no rush . he was great . went so far as to buy a beer glass to take home . i will be back . 
simple comfort food . cheap beer . perfect spot for catching up with old friends . don ' t expect a lot from the food . it is simple . it doesn ' t try to do anything extravagant . it is meatballs and sauce over pasta with some vegetables on the side . that ' s it . but it is all done well , and it just makes you feel happy inside . they don ' t serve any liquor so wash it all down with some cheap beer or , for you foofy types , a glass of wine . either is a perfect match for the simple fare they serve up . and don ' t forget dessert . the homemade ice cream sandwiches are great . altogether , you can walk out of there spending no more than N on food and maybe the same on drinks if you are really getting after it . a great experience for the money , if you ask me . i have easily been five times with large groups , comprised usually of a bunch of non-new yorkers . they don ' t take reservations so you would be wise to show up early . yet we ( ummm , i ) seem to make the same mistake every time we show up at Npm on a saturday night and i sheepishly ask the hostess , " how long for a party of N ? oh , shit , N and a half hours ! ? ( as if i am somehow surprised after getting the same answer the previous N times . . . . ) alright , fine , put my name down . " but the wait system is a thing of beauty . they text you a link that updates you with the remaining wait time and the hostess calls you a few minutes before the table is ready . and , just like that , the burden of hanging out on a sidewalk or crammed bar so you can hear your name is lifted ! it gives you an unfettered opportunity to bomb around les and drink shitty beer and play pin ball at motor city just around the corner . . . or toss back a few appetizers elsewhere during the long wait . upstairs at stanton social , no matter how old and played out that place is , usually does the trick . this is all part of the experience , though . getting to explore the neighborhood without worrying about missing your name being called is awesome . it is new york . 
don ' t believe the hype ! here ' s what to expect . . . . . . . . . . N . wait in line for N-N while the employees move slow to make the the line grow longer N . get charged four dollars for one slice ! N . thirsty ? N . N for a can soda N . get stomach ache from all the grease
for a long time we have overlooked non solo pasta because its in a very small strip mall in a primarily residential neighborhood . a friend recommended we try it , so we did . what a wonderful surprise . it ' s a lovely , intimate restaurant that ' s cozy and warmly decorated . the service was outstanding , really the best service we ' ve experienced in a while . the bread they bring to the table is freshly baked ( you can taste it and smell it ) . we had the calamari appetizer which was perfectly battered and the marinara sauce was superb . it was big enough to serve N people . i had the veal capri which was lightly breaded and the sauce was very tasty . my husband had the del golfo which consisted of clams , mussels , scallops and jumbo shrimp in red sauce over linguine . he absolutely loved it . we were literally stuffed but we were having such a nice time and we hated to just run off . so , even though our waiter had given us our check ( at our request ) we ordered dessert and coffee . he was not a bit annoyed and was happy to describe all the desserts . the presentation of the dessert was awesome . i had the ricotta cheesecake which was very light and fluffy . it was served on a large plate that was dusted with cocoa and confectioners sugar . i dragged every bite of the cheesecake though the cocoa and powdered sugar . my husband had the chocolate dipped cannoli . wow what a presentation ! it was also on a large plate with thank you written in chocolate syrup . even the people at the next table were impressed and took a picture of it . the price for one appetizer , N entrees , several iced teas and coffees and N desserts was N . not bad at all for the portions we were given and the quality of the food and service . we will definitely make this a once a month stop if not more often . non solo pasta is our new favorite restaurant . please note that on weekends they do not seat parties of N until N N . 
ambiance for outdoor seating on patio is hard to beat anywhere in philly . honestly , the place was better when alex ran it years ago . new owners are nice , but the food ( and brunch ) is not the same . i still stop by for cheese desserts to go . 
drinks are excellent , but would not recommend the food . we ordered the rock shrimp for an appetizer and the batter wasn ' t cooked inside . and for dinner , i ordered the prime rib sirloin with au-gratin potatoes . . the best thing on the plate was the spinach that came with it . the prime rib was very bland even after i added salt and the au-gratin potatoes concept needs to be worked on . my sister who was my dinner mate ordered the pressed chicken which was dry and tasted like thanksgiving turkey and stuffing . in all , this was not a good dining experience . i left feeling like they stole my money . the only way i would go back would be for the drinks ( great mojito ) or if someone treated . maybe we shouldn ' t have ordered from the entrees because when you looked around , no one else did . they learned their lesson , unlike us . eat at trumbull kitchen at your own risk ! ! ! ! 
best pizza in the area . it is difficult to find good eats in the suburbs but this is the place . try ' the works ' . 
i ' ve been here before for a sit down dinner and we ordered pizza . it was pretty good . we just ordered take out from there and it was terrible . so i ' m not sure if the pizza is worth the money . 
this may be the best mediterranean restaurant in the city for this price range ! this is a place for smaller groups and we ' ve typically shared several small plates . entrees look amazing too and the neighborhood is perfect for walking around before or after dinner . 
as a tourist , i was just walking in for a bite to eat but definitely got more than i can chew ! this place needs to open up in miami for sure ! ! ! ! the food is just a breathe of fresh air ! i ' ve been to nyc plenty times , had many different spanish plates but blend on the water blew me away ! the sea bass , the red snapper and even what would be the basic churrasco was tasteful beyond words ! and felicia is so cute and cheerful i just wanna pack her in my luggage ! please open a location down south ! this place is exactly what us floridians are screaming for ! thanks in advance . . . 
feels like going home , and i am not even venezuelan . this is small , intimate , and what chelsea used to be all about . if you have read or have heard from friends about all the great hangouts that are no longer in chelsea , then you need to visit el cocotero . this is venezuelan food , and i have no clue , nor do i care if its gluten free gluten loaded or organic or etc . . . . . . this is is excellent venezuelan latin food with a family atmosphere that no longer exists in today ' s chelsea . 
clean , great food , friendly service and price on the menu is very reasonable . i love this place . very happy to have this restaurant come here in my neighborhood . veg sandwich , veg summer roll with peanut sauce and vietnamese coffee are few of my favorites . 
this is like going to a restaurant and your building cirta N N foot ceilings wraparound wood rooms beautiful architecture marble tables menu is of european german style foods excellent
i took my daughter for her birthday . the food was amazing from appetizer to dessert . we had steak , chicken and seafood let me say no left overs ate it all ! the staff was very attentive we received everything we asked for without hesitation . the best italian food around . i would recommend going for a drink down stairs and dinner upstairs for a wonderful dinning experience . 
the food was good . the basket of bread came out nice an warm . they were accompanied with good olive oil . yumm . we started off with the sweet and spicy calamari appetizer ( N ) because it received a lot of good reviews . when we got it , we felt the breading was not refined enough for the price we paid . it was also a little too sweet for our taste . when it came to the main course , we ordered both of the house specialties . they were the rack of lamb ( N ) and the duck confit ( N ) . both were good , but for the price we paid , the food could have been prepared better . for example , my lamb came out medium well instead of medium rare as i requested . my boyfriends duck was very overcooked . on the bright side , there was some charring on the outside of the lamb and duck , so we thought that was a nice detail . then for dessert , we had the rainbow carrot cake ( N . N ) . there was nothing fantastic about the cake . the only " rainbow " resemblance was the green dyed pistachio ice-cream and several blueberries and one sliced strawberry . overall , we felt it was good , but definitely overpriced . for N ( tax and tip included ) , we could have gotten a fantastic meal somewhere else . 
i really like this place . they have a big menu so there is something for everyone , they offer discounts for " children ' s portions " and they have everything i have ordered there has been great . this isn ' t a " white glove " five star type of place , but they get five stars from me because for what they are , a family italian restaurant , i think they do it really well . the pasta dishes like the gnocchi primavera are delicious , the salads ( mandarin orange salad is my favorite ) are fresh and the margarita thin crust pizza is the best i ' ve had in the area outside of nyc . the have reasonable prices and they also do delivery well . by that i mean the food gets to you promptly and still hot , a concept lost on many other take out places . 
love this place for weekend brunch . it ' s often packed , so get there early ( like N when they open ) , but it ' s well worth the wait . love their parfait ! 
i almost enjoyed my dinner there very much . the salad was good , the fish sides were very nice , cooked to perfection . but as soon as i went to the restroom for a brief break , the waiter swooped in cleared away half of my dinner ! even if i had been finished , i would have wanted to take that kind of food home ! i was so mad , it ruined the rest of the evening for me . it also caused a rift between myself spouse , since i thought he should have protected my food . but he was distracted by our guests , it happened so fast , he missed his chance to protest . so if you want any amore with your date after eating here , bring a sign with you saying , " don ' t take my food ! " before daring to visit the toilet . or prepare to do battle with aggressive waiters looking to clear you out , or sell you desert . 
i ordered my food an hour and a half ago and its still not here ! i was told it was only going to take a half hour ! hire another delivery driver ! 
worst plate of food to ever be placed in front of me . very limited menu . over-seasoned , soggy home fries , rubbery clams and greasy , frozen fried fish . shameful ! will not return . 
i will wait in line in the pouring rain for this delicious food . halal cart is my go to staple every time i visit ny and the dish of choice is the combo ( lamb chicken ) rice plate . the white sauce is dangerously delicious and just a bit of the red sauce will have you reaching for your drink as your tongue lights on fire . the red sauce is like tabasco on steroids . that being said , i seem to be a sucker for the heat so end up adding more white sauce to balance out the hot sauce . the best part of this cart is that they serve food all night long , the time when you really need something to grease the belly before heading to bed . it should go without saying , but this is a cash only place so make sure to always carry N in your pocket for the food and don ' t forget grabbing a soda at the next food cart to wash it all down . 
i ' m a regular at cooperage and it ' s always outstanding . the food is amazing . i ' d suggest the scallops , crab cakes , or free range chicken with grits . they have a really great southern chopped salad as well . at lunchtime the ham sliders are to die for ! the wine selection is great and there ' s always a fun specialty cocktail being featured . the service is also excellent . everyone is very friendly and accommodating . dining at cooperage is a must ! 
i hate reducing a star only a week after my first visit , but my second time here wasn ' t as stellar . my second visit would probably be a N . N stars , which i think is still a pretty good rating . probably depends on what person you get to serve you . the second time around , it was so hard to flag down our waitress . she was courteous but brusque when she interacted with us . it also took forever to bring our banchan . she was conveniently always missing or busy when we wanted to ask for more . we also didn ' t get the rice soaked in tea . not sure if this only comes with the biji dishes . spicy stir-fried squid - not worth getting for the price . this is the smallest portion for N i have ever seen . there was hardly any squid , just mostly onions . that being said , the taste was great . i love their sweet and spicy gochujang sauces . kimchi jigae - their tofu is smoother and bouncier than bcd ' s . it has a somewhat strange texture , but all the jjigae and dubu dishes are always delicious and worth getting . and it ' s cheaper . this came with three bowls of rice . i think i enjoyed the kimchi biji more though . gungjung dduk jun gol - i am not sure if this is worth the N price tag for the small , but it really is a delicious dish . it is very warming and savory . perfect for a cold winter day . the dish consists of rice cakes , fish cakes , cabbage , a hard boiled egg , enoki mushrooms , scallions , onions , and a really tiny amount of fish . we added korean noodles for N . N . the korean noodles are my favorite qq kind . they cook it on a portable stove for you and then serve it for you . nice thing though is that they take reservations , unlike bcd tofu house . on sunday , i made a monday reservation for N people and they were accommodating . i would try to make a reservation though because this place is packed . you might have to share a table with some strangers , but they put up a screen for you if that is the case . 
saturday night we dined at this great cozy place . we really enjoyed our meal and the service was impecable
i ordered from here for the first time last night . i had the jerk chicken with rice and beans , shrimp rice , and chili wings . i am not a fan , the food wasn ' t bad per say . . . just lack luster at best . i ' m a huge fan of jerk chicken , and their ' s was on the bland side . the cabbage salad portion was super small ( one of my favorite parts of the meal ) which was a disappointment . the shrimp rice had a ' funk ' to it . . . like the rice was old . . not that it was cooked previous , just sitting around in grain form for a while . the chili wings had very little meat on them , and were drenched in sweet chili sauce . . . . again nothing special
the bread is good . i will give them that . i ordered a roast pork with sharp provolone . the meat was fatty . the bread soggy . i didn ' t finish the sandwich . i will give them another try for an italian hoagie . 
we gave prime N a N star review due to upcharging and a basic sense that no one cared . well - they do . we were called by the manager and our informing them of the issue led to them discovering an issue in their computer system - where the charges were correct but just not on the receipt - this is really what we wanted to have happen for prime N to fix the issue . we went back twice in N weeks in order to make sure that the changes were fixed and they were N ) my daughter loved her friends mozz and it was a little greasy and it was remade for her . N ) my burger was cooked perfect - yay - i can eat with my family ! ! N ) fried pickles - best ever ! ! ! ! N ) my eldest daughter is a wing fiend and so happy to have a place where she can get amazing toppings for dinner . our waitresses were awesome - attentive and very caring , making sure that we had what we needed and making sure that we were cared for . it felt like family . louis was very attentive and i loved his gregarious attitude , he was making sure that were taken care of and also explained how the chef prepared everything from scratch . we really felt like the whole staff wanted us to have a great time and this was not forced . prime N went from a - never going again to a when are we going back ? we love that we have a go to place that our whole family loves - thank you for caring ! 
a swanky place that serves decent tapas , amazing warm crusty bread , and wine ( one warning - the sangria is very sweet ) . the tapas are solid but not all amazing , so pick carefully ! barcelona recommends N-N tapas per person , which is a lot , so unless you ' re ravenous or have a lot of money , N-N is plenty , and be sure to save room for dessert . also , the vegetarian tapas come in larger portions than the meat ones , and that the bread is unlimited . tapas commentary my favorites are crispy calamari , papas bravas , herbed goat cheese and mushrooms , and warm cana de cabra with figs and apples . the roasted garlic bulbs are always a little under-salted but are fun to smear on the bread . don ' t bother with the empanadas . the lobster risotto is terrible , and the duck confit is too rich and fatty . the meatballs , however , are wonderfully ordinary . as for the dessert , definitely go for the flan catalan - even if you ' re not a flan person , which i ' m not , this flan will blow you away ! so smooth , rich , soft and creamy . . . mmm . . . 
coworkers clued me on this place an i am hooked ! ! ! the food is fresh , the service is fast , and the food is yummy . enough said ! oh , and the prices are reasonable . 
delicious stuffed artichoke ! both my sister and i really enjoyed them . i haven ' t had one like that in years and was happy to find a place that made them so well . i also had the chicken franchese which was good . it came with two pieces of chicken and i chose to get pasta with it instead of a salad . kinda wished the pasta had the same sauce instead of the red sauce , but only because i ' m picky like that . we then shared the tartufo , which was great as well . came with N pieces , we ended up eating two each . i also ordered a cappuccino , the glass was a little messy so i had to wipe my hands off , but it was good . overall , i definitely will be going back to try more . 
i had the grilled vegetable crepe and on a rating from N to N i would give it a N . i had never had crepes served in that style before so it was a new experience . if i visit again i would add a few extras in the crepe to layer more flavors . the coffee was fantastic . the ceramic container for the milk to pour into your coffee was a white porcelain cow and the milk poured from a tiny hole in his mouth . a fabulous item to have on the table as a conversation piece . my friends had the snails and they seemed pleased . they compared the texture to a mushroom , however they did not comment on the taste . i loved the interior decoration for its romantic style . it was a bit noisy so anyone who likes a quiet dinner would not be happy there . i went during the evening hours so maybe it would be a little less noisy during brunch . 
soco has been the best restaurant i have ever dined at . the waffles and chicken were superb . the waiter was really nice and was sure to give us all the options and he even addressed me and my date by our names . i would definitely eat here again . great experience and great food
unbelievable food at reasonable prices ! service is friendly and prompt . easily the best tandoori dishes in princeton- try the mixed grill which involves decoratively presented grilled meats , fish and shrimp on a sizzling platter . the malabari is also to die for and don ' t miss out on the garlic nan ! 
visited more for the trendy ambiance for the bklyn neighborhood , but don ' t be surprised that the food and drinks are a smashing good time . my fav is the cheese covered corn and mojitos . . . . . . . . . . . 
i like c p overall ! it is a fun place great for groups or two or even one . we ordered pizza the last time and i was actually surprised that it was so good . my husband was too . boys loved it . the crab legs were good , as well as the crab fries . who doesn ' t love them ? ! service was ok , not bad . i really would love to check it out on a game night , and i ' m sure their happy hours are great . 
i hate begging to pee . i find it distinctly demeaning . i also hate holding my pee . i find that it hurts my bladder . that brings me to why i no longer frequent claire ' s corner copia . as a paying client , the procedure for getting access to the public bathroom at claire ' s corner copia N . butt in front of a long line of other clients to ask the barrista for the key N . listen to the barrista scream to the kitchen that someone should unlock the bathroom N . stand about waiting for someone to come out of the kitchen with a bathroom key N . follow that person to the bathroom to be let in i find that procedure humiliating . and tonight , no one came out of the kitchen to open the bathroom for me . i stood about waiting and feeling embarrassed and having to pee until i eventually decided to sit down , write this angry letter and vow never to return to claire ' s . also , they serve their coffee lukewarm . 
i don ' t get to frequent the great wazu often , but when i do , i always end up getting the same sandwich - turkey sloppy joe ! it is one of my all time favorites that i can remember from being a kid . the staff is super friendly and they always recognzie their customers . there is usally a line , but it moves pretty quickly and convenient to get lunch on the go . 
airy and lively restaurant with large portions , delicious food , and reasonable prices . the restaurant is always crowded ( there was even a short wait for a table on monday evening at N pm ) , but is definitely worth the wait . we got N market sides - the fried plantains were delicious - sweet and not too oily , the garlic mashed potatoes were okay ( a bit bland ) , the zucchini with cheese was excellent , and the asian marinated tofu was pretty good but was a bit salty ( too much soy sauce ) . the veggie burger was amazing - probably one of the best i have had in the city - right mix of vegetables in the pattie and the right amount of flavor food came quickly and the waitress was great . 
being it my first time in times square in many many years . i was a bit overwhelmed by the task of finding somewhere to eat that was around my hotel ( the renaissance ) that would meet expectations in terms of overall dining experience . unfortunately , i picked somewhere that ultimately failed me . not a fan of " family style " or single items made to feed entire families , i was a bit at a loss when searching the menu for something that would meet the criteria of " relatively " healthy and also tasty . i ended up going with the only items on the menu that were made for one person , the hero . i went with the prosciutto , mozzarella and tomato hero that came with a caesar salad . the bread for the hero was tough and seemed to have been around at least for a couple days and the tomatoes were no where near ripe . the caesar salad was easily the best part of the dish and it also was mediocre . i think it had been the first time that i had experienced hunger due to consuming food of no flavor . i wouldn ' t suggest heading over here if you ' re at all health conscience and don ' t want to pay exorbitant prices for being in times square . 
best pepperoni pizza i ' ve ever had . pizza has a crisp crust and the pepperoni is to die for . a must try ! 
dear box N , please get high chairs ! all of the staff we met were friendly and it smelled good , but we ended up going elsewhere because there was no place for my son to sit . 
seriously underdogs . Npm ? why can ' t you be open all the time ? ? ? ? ? ? lol i want a buffalo gal ! ) 
i am so happy to find a go-to restaurant in hell ' s kitchen . . i kind of don ' t want word on nook to get out , but i also want them to stay open , so here i am . the tuna . my god , the tuna . bring wine ! 
two words hanger steak . i liked it so much i told the head chef in person . that man understands meat ! 
when hype for this meat haven began building , i became increasingly excited as the days went by and the menu was revealed . finally months later my girlfriend and i finally set aside a date to attend for dinner . if i were basing the review strictly on the food , they would receive N stars . however i think one thing hurting this otherwise great place is the lack of an official website . our understanding was based solely on info we found at menu-pages , and as such we discovered the actual offerings to be quite different . though the list on menu-pages named N or so pieces of offal we were disappointed to only find the veal heart on the menu the evening we were there . for a place that was built so much on the hype surrounding its offering of yummy guts and other bits , we were hoping for more . having said that , the food was all delicious . the disco fries with fresh ricotta were oozy and utterly superb . the deep fried pickles were spicy and super crisp , as were the killer cracklin ' s . one of the real stars of the evening was a bowl of fresh corn studded with guanciale . i found the hot dogs to be totally fabulous - i ordered one straight up and one with cheese sauce and crispy fried onions and peppers . the dog meat was perfectly juicy and dense ( in a good way ) . for dessert we ordered the fig tart , which was indeed a bit understated , but we enjoyed it nonetheless . i think it ' s great that they share a backyard with their neighborhood and compatriot establishment , the spuyten duyvil , especially while they get their liquor license up and running . in the meantime they do offer a variety of tasty sodas , including sprecher ' s root beer on tap , which is one of my faves . i ' m not sure why some people are complaining about the price . most of the items on the menu run around N . we were both completely satisfied and got out for around N including tip . it ' s totally worth noting that i would go back just for the atmosphere . i love the frontier-land style decor - the wood paneled walls and carved ceiling , the craggy wood bar , the rusty farm implements hanging on the wall . i found myself wishing it were the dead of winter and i had just come in from a cold walk . overall i do think they need to decide a bit more what their menu is about and execute it more consistently . but i will definitely be back . i want this place to succeed very badly . good luck ! 
jacob ' s lived up to expectations . i visited for brunch and loved the savory comfort food , obviously pickled and biscuit inspired . the blt bloody marys were delicious , complete with bacon and hard boiled egg . and the service was very attentive . the wait was so-so but goes with the territory , and it gets pretty loud inside . but the open air concept is great for brunch or happy hours . a few days later i visited again and enjoyed catfish tacos and homemade meatballs in fried green tomato sauce , which were worthwhile . good beer selection too . i hope to be back . 
terrible experience . we walked into N N full restaurant but were told we had to wait for a table . we milled around the bar for N minutes before being seated at a table that was empty when we first walked in . strike one . waited N minutes for our server to take our order . strike two . food arrived after N minutes , and it was ice cold . strikes three and four . will never go back . 
i must amend my original review about average service , etc . after leaving the review , the owner emailed and was extremely courteous and professional , and in this day and age , it is not often you find such a personal outreach to remedy a situation . pros patio dining bar is fair and it is a full bar parking out back family friendly owner attempted to remedy any issues cons a lot of college-age staff waiters the seating can be crowded and the place can be noisy at times stick with signature items for the bets experience
i ' m not gonna lie . i was a fan of the previous mundo and was damn disappointed ( like a lot of people ) when it closed down over a year ago . who couldn ' t help but love john willy , their eclecticly-tasty food , and the just as eclectic crowd they drew to their little place on Nnd street broadway here in astoria ? for my wife i , we had the distinct feeling that one gets when a dear friend moves many miles away . sure you ' re happy that they ' re moving on to new things , but you selfishly feel like they should nonetheless stay and continue to serve you your favorite red sonja oregano seasoned french fries no matter how much they might need a break . and so , about a month ago , with some apprehension much baited breath , my wife i stepped through the lobby of the new paper factory hotel and into the warmly familiar , but wholly new revitalized mundo . i was so happy and excited to see it . it is truly the next phase in what i think they ' ve always dreamed mundo could be . it ' s bigger , but still warm and inviting , and it contains all the turkish-argentine-world decor that i loved about their old spot . they even have a proper , well stocked bar now . but , most importantly , the food is as delicious and as fresh as ever . not only have willie jon lovingly poured their hearts into the look feel of the space , but they ' ve also reinvigorated the food . while red sonja still has that savory je ne sai quoi , the empanadas , salads the veggie wrap tasted as good as they ' ve ever tasted . and at the bar , they had these addictive pisco sours that i can tell are going to be the go-to cocktails for the new mundo bar . also , as i understand it , they ' re even going to have live music on the lower level of the space . mundo could very well be a new hub for art , music live performance in astoria . i now live in la and there is nothing like mundo here . hell , there ' s nothing like mundo anywhere else in the world from what i ' ve seen , a place that ' s part of the neighborhood , that ' s unique and inviting and otherworldly at the same time . and now that i ' m in la , i can ' t help but feel like i ' m going to be missing out on seeing mundo N . N continue to grow . i miss mundo , jon , willie , pinar and would move them here if i could , but i ' m heartened to know that they are back in astoria , better than ever , and that even more people will get to discover their charms , their warmth , and the unique mundo integrity they brought with them from the original mundo space . mundo que viva ! 
upon entering i used the bathroom and saw the cook use the urinal and leave without washing his hands . then i tried to get a table for two and told i could not be seated until my wife was with me . it was N pm . the place was empty . now the place will be less N more people . now don ' t be mislead i go there N times a month so they know me by sight . i will never return . this is not the first time this place has me mad . 
rojak was so good ! ! i miss hay-ko . just missing the eu-char-kueh ( chinese doughnuts ) . prawn noodle soup was quite good . kang kung belachan pretty good . hainanese chicken - it ' s better at new malaysia . 
compared to halal guys at Nth st , this guys really need to up their game a lot . however , for the price and effort , i suppose you guys can scrape N . N stars . rounded to N stars . meat is in chunks but not savoury like halal guys . 
there were four in our party . started off with drinks at the bar . they were quite simply amazing . they were the highlight of the evening . really expertly crafted flavors came together delightfully in the jefferson rozefort ( rum ) and the ian fleming ( gin ) . once seated , we had the tasting menu , N courses for N . we had a vegetarian in our party , and at first they said they couldn ' t accommodate us on the tasting menu without making us all have a veggie tasting , but then they said they could . as it turned out , most of the dishes were veggie anyway ( N of the N ) , not sure if that would have been the case without the veggie in our party . but i digress slightly . starting off with the wine . . . the server ' s knowledge was abominable . we let her select , but suggested we ' d like an old world , medium body , perhaps a rhone or chateauneuf . she consulted the sommelier , and came back with what she said was a " burgundy from rioja " . now , we are admittedly winos , but this characterization is just an oxymoron . we thought perhaps she ' d brought us a pinot noir from a non-designate area of spain close to rioja . . . or something like that . nope , it was a straight up rioja . when we asked her why she called it a burgundy . . . was she referring to the style ? . . . she had no idea what we were talking about . we started with the amuse bouche described elsewhere in reviews . . . a bean soup . nice , but not remarkable . we then had a starter salad of beets with frisee . it was very nice . we all enjoyed it . this was followed by a garbanzo dish done N ways - a puree , some whole garbanzos , and some fried garbanzo skins . not that interesting , and a lot of beans considering the amuse was beans as well . after the garbanzos , we had a cavatappi with sage . ok , nothing to write home about . this was followed by a cod steak done quite nicely , very flavorful , with a slight crisp on the skin . next was a sorbet palate cleanser that counted as a course , which seemed odd to us . our main course was a skirt steak , beef heart , beef tongue , marrow medley served in a beef broth . the marrow was savory and delicious . the skirt steak was nicely served . the tongue and heart were interesting , but again , not super flavorful or cleverly seasoned . the vegetarian in our party had a plate full of squash for her main . it didn ' t look very attractive , and she didn ' t enjoy it . the dessert was a total disappointment - a dry doughnut with a little apple and cream . just uninteresting . not worth the dessert calories . we ordered a second wine , again letting the server choose ( based on prior interaction , probably a mistake , but she said she would ask the sommelier again ) . she brought a lebanese wine , and when we asked her what grapes were in it and in what percentages , she looked like a deer in the headlights , and started fast talking , which made it clear she didn ' t know . why she didn ' t bring the sommelier over is beyond me . overall , we were just not very impressed given all the press the restaurant has gotten . i have a work colleague that raves about hearth , and he is a big time foodie , so we are left to surmise that our tasting experience may have simply been compromised with the vegetarian requirement . might try again , but won ' t hurry back . 
love the concept and the decor . very warm atmosphere and has a great tea menu . we had a rushed dinner here ( because of our schedule not the restaurant ) but enjoyed it and left happy . we shared the shredded beef in plantain cups appetizer ( more than enough for N ppl ) and i had the shrimp w coconut lime sauce . yum ! i would definitely go back . 
i was really disappointed with this restaurant . the reviews here were good and i looked forward to the visit but i found the following N . there ' s really no need for the place not to have a menu . i ' ll bet the toppings don ' t vary much from night to night and even if they did change a couple each night , they could put them on the board . this kind of " i ' ll tell you what ' s on the menu " premise just seems forced and pretentious . especially when they ' re rattled off ( see below ) . N . the waitstaff was inattentive and seemed uncomfortable with providing good service , filling water glasses , getting change , making eye contact . she ticked off the menu like she wanted to get out of there . there were approximately N waitresses for about N tables and we were having problems getting service . not acceptable , especially for a place that has N menu items . it ' s not like they have to juggle a lot of varied orders . N . the pizza crust was soggy , the cheese all flowed to the middle so that you had approximately N inches of plain crust on the outside . the crust is the star at these places but mine was slightly burnt . N . a N pie should be made with the best ingredients . part of the problem with having the kitchen in the area is that you can see what they ' re actually using . bertolli ' s olive oil ? you ' re charging me N more for a pizza than elsewhere and cheaping out on the olive oil ? maybe they run down to the met to buy it so it ' s convenient . N . the wait was less than they told us and they called us with time for us to get over there , so that part was great . it was a wednesday night . they seemed to handle this efficiently , even with their popularity . overall , i was surprised by the lack of follow through . at these prices , the focus should be on the food and service , but the pizza was far from artisanal and the service sub-par . it was really one of those moments where i walked out wondering why people were so sold on this place . the bar for pizza is pretty high in brooklyn . i walked out of here feeling like i wasted my money , especially with better , cheaper options nearby . 
yes , the food warrants more than N stars , however , the service was averaging at about N-N stars , so i ' m bringing down the overall ratings . we made a reservation for N at N N for a sunday night , and the restaurant was bursting , very vibrant and a lot was happening . not gona lie , combination of the crowd on a sunday night as well as the rave reviews raised my expectations . however , even though we made reservations , we couldnt be seated immediately , and on top of that , when we were seated , we were cramped into a booth that should seat N instead of N . come on people . really ? the seating made most of the meal uncomfortable , since we were constantly bumping into one another . our waiter was also not very helpful . when we expressed the desire to share all the food and asked about portion size he shrugged and claimed that they were " appetizer sizes " and looked extremely skeptical when we opted to order only N entrees , when we inquired as to whether itd be enough food , he shrugged again and told us " its only three entrees " . right . we can count . waters were also not being refilled , and overall an extreme lack of friendliness from our waiter . yes , the food was quite spectacular , the octopus app was amazing . soft , and tender , not a hint of chewiness that you so often get with octopus . the lamb shank was another standout of the night , but would i really want to sit through another N hours of bad and unwelcoming service . . . . . . . not really . 
the best of the best . great food and a nice family atmosphere . talking to the owners is always great - and the staff is wonderful too . ricotta gnocchi is my favorite , but i also love the caesar salad , calamari , fish and filet mignon dishes they have . and cynthia ' s desserts are amazing . 
im not sure if the people who eat at this establishment have low or no standards but if i could give his place zero stars i would . if i could give it negative stars itd be most ideal . the young incompetent ghetto youth working there are an absolute turn off . no smile no greeting no effort in their appearance . . . the " waitresses " walk around in dingy leggings and socks . . . if you can concentrate on your medeocre meal over their loud inappropriate conversations with their baby daddies and them your realize you made the wrong choice . cracked plates , freezer burned vegetables , just an over all terrible experience . the thing that really bothers me , and made me take the time to write this nightmare down is . . . i went to eat there while i was pregnant . . . they have no bathroom . i had to beg to use it . . once they allowed me to use the bathroom i had to walk through a disgusting kitchen , where no gloves were being used and the area food that was being served was not at all up to standards . . . i wonder what inspector they paid off to get this shanty opened . off to bbb because this experience was not an anomoly . i know several people who have gotten disrespect from this place . from the employees to the manager gary . i tried to rectify this but got cursed out . customers are never right at just fish . . . and it just sucks ! ! 
such an amazing experience ! the service was great , the food was so delicious , and the atmosphere was warm and comfortable ! definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone ! 
if i am traveling on business in the area , i try to make it a point to stop in for lunch here . great food with a good lunch selection , friendly service , and the homemade kettle cooked chips are tough to say no to . 
its definitely yummy . . . i love their roti canai . . . i got some tofu dish last time and it was delish ! only complaint is that some of their mexican workers kept looking and staring at us when we were eating . . . felt very awkward
great brunch . . dinner is ehhh . def worth going for brunch ! service is great and staff is very friendly . . . also very baby friendly ! 
always fun , always great energy and delicious food . perfect place to bring a visitor to nyc ! ! variety offers a taste for everyone ' s palate . rooftop beer garden nice addition . 
i had dinner here a few weeks ago at the bar . i have to say that i had an amazing time . the bartender tom , was so cool and funny . he made the experience a lot of fun . the food was delicious too say the least . i cant wait to go back . if i had one complaint it would be the other bartender , i think her name was kelly , or kelsey ? very strange girl and seemed flustered the whole time . but over all , loved ! ! ! 
went here for my girlfriend ' s birthday . had a late reservation but the restaurant was still busy . they gave us our choice of tables so we waited a little bit . the good was good especially the meatball sliders ! ! highly recommend getting those . they make it worth going back again ! 
if i could i would give this N stars . excellent pizza , excellent service , and great prices . we can feed our family of N for under N including drinks . even my N yr old who is a cheese pizza purist loves this pizza , she just wont eat the blackened charred crust edge . more for me . we have never had to wait more than N N an hour to be seated and food is delivered to the table really quickly . best pizza to try , recommended by a local , mozzarella and onion . we were told they soak their onions in olive oil till tender . so sweet and yummy . because of work we get to live in new places every N months . we tried to eat at the competitors sally ' s . we placed our order and never got the pizza there , they lost our order at sally ' s . 
walking around montclair looking for a place to have breakfast on a lazy saturday morning we stumbled on raymond ' s and we were not disappointed . delicious dishes , fast and friendly service and nice ambience were to be had here . although the prices were not cheap but in line for this neck of the woods in jersey . raymond ' s will be sure to please for a breakfast or lunch . . . 
i love it here ! my favorite dishes are the soslu patlican ( a stewed eggplant dish ) and the hummus . i ask for it served with cucumber and they always accommodate with a large dish , nicely sliced . 
my wife and i like thai food a lot . started eating in the early ' Ns when it broke in california . sri pra phai is pretty fair , but does not live up to the hype . food is good but on par with other good thai places around the city . service staff is uneven and the buzz probably puts too much load on them and causes the service issues . we were rushed to finish , and change was not returned until we asked for it . ( we left the change , but that should be our choice , not an assumption . ) food is fine but avoid busy nights and don ' t make a special trip . i could name two other restaurants in queens that are as good , and some in manhattan and brooklyn that are better - mostly for the service and atmosphere . 
N beers on tap . good hang out for upenn students . most of my classmate goes here after glass to blow off some steam . i ' m glad they have the games on the tv most of the time so i can ignore them if i need to . this place is a-ok in my books . 
great greek restaurant ! the tough part is trying to decide what menu entr es to order the service was very attentive and i agree maybe not the quickest service but that was nice we wanted to linger over this great meal . my husband and i split the greek salad and the three dip appetizer the three dip appetizer was baba gauhnous delicious red pepper and feta cheese which i eat all of and a sardine dip which he ate all of . we both ordered the grilled whole fish which was outstanding . it came wrapped in grape leaves and our waiter fileted at the table . it was perfectly seasoned and so delicious . unfortunately we had theater tickets so didn ' t have a chance to have dessert and coffee but i will definitely plan to do so when we return the next time . another plus it is byob and they have some tables outside for some nice dining al fresco . 
i have been to this place a few times . overall , the food is excellent and pasta is very fresh . i just had their pizza which i think was a good thin crust pizza . it great to see good italian food come to the sunnyside . the only reason i give it N stars is the menu is very small and i find the chairs to be very uncomfortable as they have almost no back . also , i find the service adequate but can be slightly problematic when its packed . 
smooth move , jerks you just lost yourselves several loyal customers . i called to make a reservation for mother ' s day breakfast almost two weeks in advance , and was told that they generally take reservations for up to N people , but since we would be coming in super early by N-Nam , it really shouldn ' t be a problem to seat our group of N . the lady telling me this took my name and number and told me she would call me back if there was an issue . so . . . i never got a call saying there was an issue . sunday rolls around and N of us show up ( bright and early , to a very slow cafe . . . which easily has the capability to seat two tables of N in the back , which is something that i ' ve seen done many times ) and are told that they refuse to seat us despite the reservation , won ' t even let us wait for however long for a table to open up , and that if we " really want to eat here , " we will have to be seated in groups of N and " probably not at tables near each other . " this was said with a smirk . totally unnecessary . screw these guys . despite the good food , i will not be returning , just on principle . i ' d rather patronize respectable businesses . . . ( like one shot , where we ended up eating a delicious brunch after this annoying cluster ) 
great pancakes and other great american traditional food served here . i ' m a long-time customer . 
service is really good , the food is fresh and the selection is vast . for N all you can eat , hot pot and bbq , really can ' t beat it
we went to north end grill for dinner on a saturday evening . the service was very friendly and when we asked for suggestions , they really knew their stuff . we started with the bucatini , bacon and heirloom tomato appetizer . the pasta was cook perfectly--true al dente . the bacon was smokey and the tomatoes ripe and flavorful . for entrees , i had the nova scotia halibut and my boyfriend had the beef tenderloin . both were also cooked to the desired level of doneness and were delicious . lastly , for dessert we had the huckleberry panna cotta it was also very delicious . there ' s also a great selection of scotch and wines--although some options are a bit pricey . great restaurant will come back again ! 
was excited after having tasted excellent pizzas in memphis , tn N years ago . disappointed ! ! . not very clean . staff did not know what was going on . we asked for veg pizza and the staff told us it would be at least N minutes before they could get one . they ran out of jalapeno pizzas . they kept running out of items ( breadsticks and pasta ) and took some time to replenish . if you have a lot of patience , give it a try . to be fair , when we ran out of patience ( after getting confusing answers from staff such as N hour wait ) , the manager was kind enough to refund the payment after we told him we are not going to eat . 
based on the many reviews here , i traveled to Nth street from flushing to try this place . it ' s in the space long occupied by arunee thai . yes , the remodel is modern and attractive , with comfortable faux barcelona chairs , and lots of mirrors . our waitress , i believe an owner or manager , was pleasantly attentive and ultimately apologetic . and yes , it is inexpensive for lunch at N . N . the cook who earned all the five star reviews was either having a bad day or had just left town . it was one of the most disappointing thai meals i ' ve ever had . why so bad ? the curry puff was not yet defrosted i sent it back and it was replaced with an identical , but colder version . when eventually warm , it was tasty . the next dish , essentially singapore mai fun , had the wrong meat in it not a big deal , but it was oddly insipid , as if several ingredients were missing . the pad see yew , a favorite standard , had a nasty , off after taste which was traceable to the mistreated shrimp and it too was otherwise flavorless and boring . pad ka prow with ground chicken was edible , but was far too sweet , as was the pad thai , which was drowned in sugar and tamarind syrup . i ordered dishes that are hard to screw up , but they were . i suspect the cook was hired from a chinese fast food place . . . although i heard the owner speaking in the kitchen in thai . i ' m very reluctant to send dishes back , but had to do so here three times . thai food can and should be delicious , even if not spicy or " authentic . " 
this restaurant swept us off our feet ! this is the best mexican food i have ever had . the food was very elevated and well-done . the ambiance up stairs was great . we were a group of N and the service was phenomenal ! 
this place is a bit too modern . it has an old fashioned looking brick oven but the decor is a bit sterile . they also have logo with a big m that doesn ' t look any thing like a classic new haven pizza place . we got a medium pie . . N N broccoli , sausage and cheese and N N just cheese . i am sorry to report that it was not particularly flavorful and the crust was soggy . the service was also slow . . we arrived at N p . m . in an attempt to beat the crowd . . . it was not very busy but it seemed to take forever to get our food . 
let ' s be serious here pommes frites serves up delicious food as is , but the real delight is in going here after a drinking jaunt in the east village . after all , nothing soaks up your three vodka tonics better than a heaping portion of greasy fries and a side of roasted garlic mayonnaise . oh , and how pommes frites soaks that alcohol up ! the fries are simply divine hot , crispy without being overly so , and served in an old world-style paper cone . and , of course , the dips would make any condiment connoisseur ' s mouth water . though i ' ve only ever tried the roasted garlic mayonnaise--as a european , i ' ve got a bit of an affinity for mayo--my friends have raved about everything from the parmesan peppercorn to the peanut satay . the service is quick , and the servers always seem jovially amused by something ( the people stumbling through the door , perhaps ? ) . seating is limited , so it ' s best to either go during midday to grab a seat or simply take your frites to go . bathroom grade n a . you want a bathroom with your fries ? go to mcdonald ' s . 
food was excellent . it ' s a pricey place and a tad precious for my tastes . portions are smallish especially the desserts . i understand what they are going for but it ' s a bit stiff and precious . the chef is truly talented . everything we had was great . this type of service is not what i look for in a restaurant experience . i hope they loosen up and warm up the decor . the food is the star here . the room needs some warmth as does the staff , they seem tense and on edge . my summary is unless you have oodles of money , someone is treating or want to have a quiet dinner - piora is for you . go try a dish or N , and have a glass of wine in the bar area . it ' s quiet and you can talk , that ' s a plus . 
we went to bassoN saturday night before the super bowl and were blown away by the service and the food . the manager made it seem like we were old friends that hadn ' t seen each other for a long time . when we were snowed in the day after the game , we didn ' t hesitate to return to this gem of a place . the manager saw me at the door and once again greeted us as old friends , giving me a huge hug , since my team had been trounced the day before . this is a place i will return to again and again when visiting the big apple ! 
i was very impressed with this restaurant ! sometimes finding authentic and delicious mexican food can be a challenge . at xochitl everything is fresh and exciting , from the food to the atmosphere . the staff was very friendly , and the layout and design of the restaurant stayed true to mexican style . the menu is loaded with tasty options . dishes range from the authentic guacamole , to tortilla soup , and the eclectic entr e choices . i decided to go with the camarones con caldo , which is a must ! seared shrimp , sweet plantain cake , chile broth topped with an avocado salad . also the drink menu is a must ! nothing pairs better with a meal than a good margarita or martini . and lets not forget the most important part , dessert . the donuts come out with fruit dipping sauces to try from which is the perfect way to end the meal . i definitely will be back soon ! 
we walked in and were greeted by a waitress saying " two ? " . we were seated at a tiny table for N when there were plenty of seats available . by the time out appetizers came out i asked to sit at a bigger table . the vegetable spring rolls were ok . the sauce it came with was amazing . my boyfriend loved the shrimp rolls ( i don ' t eat seafood ) . he ordered the sirloin steak . . . which turned out not to be sirloin nor the way he asked it to be cooked . it was a small portion for about N . i got the red basil singapore noddles for about N . delicious spicy ! ! ! ! the service was ok . sometimes i felt like i was ignored and bothering them . i will go there again . . . only for takeout of those noodles . 
how happy was i to discover this new indian restaurant that opened a few blocks away from my house . it is one of the first in our lefferts garden flatbush neighborhood . i have ordered from there nearly every weekend since it opened . the food is incredibly good and fresh and is filled with spices and herbs . the prices are reasonable . you can have your food delivered ( very fast ) or dine in . the staff is very friendly . i have ordered the shrimp tikka masala , chana aloo and the chana masala . my husband loves the lamb and chicken masala . they are all magnificent and the portions are large . the samosas and nans are also great . my husband and i usually eat the left overs for lunch the next day because there ' s so much food . they have lunch and dinner specials too . i would highly recommend this restaurant . let ' s help keep this restaurant in our neighborhood . 
beer selection is decent but it ' s hard to find variety between the other beer bars in new haven . atmosphere is great . food is all right , but expensive . my biggest qualm is the service . you can sit at a table or at the bar and wait N minutes before even being acknowledged . it always seems like they have a lot of staff there , but they are usually too busy talking to each other at the end of the bar . 
i agree with regina that the soda machine was really gross , the soda is also very weak like it tastes like soda diluted with seltzer . i like the hot dogs though , their all the way dogs with the chili , onions and mustard was my fav , although their chicago dog is pretty good too . they also have sweet potato fries which are crispy and sweet and served piping hot . also i think sundays their dogs are N . N which is pretty cheap , also that applies to wednesday , i think ? haven ' t tried anything else so can ' t really vouch for the rest of the menu . ) 
sweet afton really packs it all in . beer elitist ? grab something from the cask they rotate . hungry for some grub ? pickup some of their fried pickles ( or their delicious burger ) . looking for some cocktails ? well their sweet tea has a great blend of sweetness and alcohol . so yes , sweet afton really does it all . its not a dive bar so don ' t expect anything to be especially cheap ( but N for a great beer aint bad anyway ) . but a nice place for your one stop shop for your twilight adventures . 
the set up of penelope was very cute and trendy . i went there for breakfast and ordered their oatmeal . pros - the oatmeal portion size was huge ! it was nice and warm with nuts on top - servers were attentive and made sure we were enjoying the experience cons - towards the end of our meal i started feeling rushed , server gave us our check without being asked to - even when we were clearly still talking , server was still at the corner peering over to check to see if we had out our cards in to pay - needless to say , our server was a little too attentive and pushy for the check - table set up was too close ! i could hear the conversation going on next to us - the price for oatmeal ( N ) is a little ridiculous . . . it was delicious but it was also something that ' s not hard or expensive to make
we are absolutely in love with this place ! ! this is the ultimate post partying food or a good lunch place . be prepared for long lines . only negative is they don ' t take reservations . our favorite dish is the mac and cheese trio and the soup and sammie . 
swine is so unique because it brings a dive bar feel to a nice restaurant with fine wine ! it has N levels so if you are in the mood for a cozy meal , you can sit downstairs . if you are in the mood for a bar , you can sit upstairs ( and still enjoy all of the yummy food options ) ! please try the bone marrow burger . . . you will not be disappointed ! ! all of the staff are very friendly and welcoming . swine is my new favorite west village hang ! 
dishes have to be cleaner . at beginning the food were good and now they more like slacking of making them . in order to have more customers , they have to be more consistent . make sure you dump all of the left over like hot sour peppers etc . they will bring it out for the next customer . sometime there is hair in the food . 
run for your life ! the noise level is so bad in this restaurant , you will leave with a head ache ! nothing tastes this good to put up with this noise . fig season and my pizza had dried figs on it . salad was only ok . shame on you salute . you could do better ! 
the food is great ! but the staff is hard and cold . the first time i went to the place , the owner wasn ' t friendly . ok , we all have bad days . but when the staff is the same , you think twice . then i took my family , same attitude . never again ! i really feel sad for them , that they have to follow such a rude and unfriendly boss . i don ' t know why he is such unfriendly person . i work in the event biz and relations is everything . you can have great food , but bad attitude will kill . sorry brisket town ! good food , but poor , poor attitude
walked by this afternoon with my roomie today , popped in just check it out but decided to stay for " a drink , " which happened to be a " voodoo " bloody mary ( which is basically a meal fyi ) . the lunch happy hour looks promising for future afternoon wanderings . 
i ' ve yet to eat in--they ' re great at last minute almost closing time orders ( i ' ve yet to be turned away , and i ' m typically a late eater . . once ordered at N N when they closed at ten ) N . they ' re snappy ! coming from the airport area ( sounds farther than it is ) , it ' s always ready when i get there . always . N . to echo ettya ' s sentiments , their korean pancake is where its at ! so , so , good ! N . inexpensive and good quality . N . their bibimbap is so fresh . and filling . and . good . N . great portions--especially for a college budget ! definitely recommend checking them out--hard-ish to locate--just keep your eyes peeled--shares a parking-lot . they have ramune soda--a soft-spot for me . . and so sweet--talk about sugar-rush . . ! koreana has a dedicated fan for life otu of me ) ! 
reliable sushi place . fish is ok , decent size portions . used it several times both as take out and sit-down choice . N web coupon is useful . very good value for the money . but - nothing special . just not bad . service is consistently good , they are trying to please , language problem when ordering is usually surmountable ( their chinese is much better than their english ) not worth special drive , but if you are in the nabe , pay a visit . it is byo - there is a good wine store two doors down in the same strip mall . 
this was the first gluten-free restaurant i discovered after being diagnosed with celiac disease . it ' s my favorite partly for that reason , but my review isn ' t about sentimentality . the gluten-free food is very good . i ' ve been here a number of times , and have tried just about everything on the menu , including bowls of risotto , regular and sicilian pizza , and sandwiches . i love the gf breadsticks that come with each meal , and have taken dessert items to go , such as cookies . overall , there are good flavors and textures , and the bread-y items have a nice level of moisture without falling apart . that ' s important with gluten-free foods . risotteria also serves gluten-free beer . 
pretty good
first and foremost , i am a born-and-raised peruvian , so i am very familiar with our cuisine . this past saturday , my family and i went to this restaurant to celebrate my mother ' s birthday . the interior was pleasant and inviting , which is typical of a montclair restaurant . i could tell the restaurant caters to the somewhat upscale and trendy crowd , which is fine . this is where the compliment ends . for appetizer , my wife and i had papa a la huancaina- potatoes with cheese sauce . the sauce was bland and the potatoes were tiny . i guess they ' re were trying to be fancy . i then ordered a lomo saltado , which is pretty much a simple peruvian dish consisting of fries , onions , tomatoes , and beef strips- a tasty peruvian dish ! rice was a side order- never heard of that before ! ! ! but that was ok . the dish was salty . my wife ordered a churrasco a lo pobre- grilled ribeye , tacu-tacu ( mixed rice and beans ) , sweet plantains , and a fried egg . my wife ordered the ribeye median rare but it came mostly rare . for dessert , we shared a crema volteada ( peruvian flan ) , which is one of the most delicious peruvian desserts . it was too creamy , too hard . it was either prepared a day or N before or it had too many eggs . price was on the high side , but that ' s what you get in montclair . i would ' ve rather gone to more a tradicional and authentic peruvian cuisine restaurant , but that ' s where my mother wanted to go , which is fine . i , personally , would never return because the food was lacking in taste and it was expensive to boot . 
this place is great . it ' s actually quite large , but service is very attentive , the atmosphere is nice , and the food is excellent . despite the crowd , we were not hustled along and enjoyed a delicious and leisurely meal . 
the latest iteration of the oyster house is a little edgy , modern , inviting and just a little evocative of the seaside . owner sam is unassumingly welcoming at the door , and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the food , specifically , oysters . my friend and i sat at the bar and had pemaquid and skookum oysters , the former eastern and the latter northwestern . both were perfectly chilled , fresh , lively and different enough to provide a lovely contrast . the diverse crowd included an all-age , all-race demographic , add a great beer selection and decent music and the effect is welcoming , interesting and entertaining . i recommend this place without reservation . try it . 
this place is fantastic ! food and service are always on point . it ' s right in my neighborhood so i like to swing by sometimes and grab a hotdog from the truck in their courtyard . never disappoints . 
very good . pleasant decore . will be back . 
not a whole lot to say that hasn ' t been said already . . . freshly made tortilla shells , a variety of ingredients to choose from behind the counter , chips and salsa , fountain drinks , etc . for a visual , just think of " subway " but with limited mexican food selections in lieu of subs veggies , including the handoff of your meal between employees all the way down to the register . i ordered the burrito bowl and practically inhaled it after eating little throughout the day . it was good , but nothing to get overly excited about . the best part was setting my bowl on the ultra narrow trash recepticle hole before i left . i ' m not sure what that is all about , but sorry , i ' m not smashing anything when i ' m trying to throw it away . dumb . 
it ' s worth the visit to try the bash style burger . juicy and flavorful . i wouldn ' t say it ' s going to change your world but there is always room for a good burger . the lamb burger wasn ' t too gamey and just as flavorful as the bash style burger . the hush puppies were fried perfectly . . and not too heavy . 
i ' ve been there twice and the food has not struck me as wonderful either time . the dishes are reasonably creative , but the quality doesn ' t match up to some of the other area italian restaurants . my bigger issue is the service . the second ( and final ) time i was there we were at the table for over N hours due to extraordinarily long waits between courses ( and to get the menus at the beginning and to get the check at the end ) . i enjoy a leisurely meal , but it was somewhat ridiculous . on top of that , after expressing our displeasure at the delays we were informed that because there were N of us the gratuity was included . the N they added was over the top -- most restaurants in the area that do add a tip for larger parties ( and i ' m not sure N is that large ) are at N or N . the N is way above what we would have left given the lackluster service . very unimpressive and a great way to make sure that annoyed patrons become ex-patrons . 
i ' ve visited fernandes regularly whenever we have family celebration and this is our favorite restaurant . i love to spend my money in a place where i get good quality food , good service , great atmosphere and plenty of parkings . i get all of these qualities right here . a plus about them , is that you get plenty of food with a great taste and a reasonable price . if you ' re a good observer , you notice that the food is not frozen like many other restaurants . the meat that is fresh keeps it reddish colored and the vegetables are also fresh . there is plenty of valet parking and a security guard is at the entrance of the place which make me feel secure in the newark area . if you are a wine drinker , their wine selection is huge . i can ' t say enough about this place , let me also mentioned their rodizio if you are a meat love get a group of friends with a big appetite and don ' t let me forget to mention their tasteful sangria , omg ! ! ! . the location is not the best but it has its advantage because it ls located at the beginning of newark , close to the exit holland tunnel , parkway , or N N . great atmospheres and great service . my family favorite waiter is valentine . nice people and nice place ! ! 
ramen here was whatever ' s . cali has way better japanese ramen then this place . 
found this restaurant on yelp . the staff was very friendly and the food was excellent ! my son and i shared a sausage sampler and my wife enjoyed the austrian metballs . both of these dishes were ' sehr gut ! ' . in addition , i had the beet salad which was excellent . overall an excellent meal . my only complaint is that was only one employee that spoke german , and she didn ' t seem interested in doing so . probably not a big deal for most and it certainly didn ' t detract from the delicious meal . 
our friends moved into an apt . on Nth and wharton over the summer and rosario ' s has become a staple for take out in our group . rosario ' s will even deliver to our place in passyunk square east ! all their food is amazing - i personally love the taco pizza ( the best of both worlds if you ask me ) and their wings are solid too . delivery times have always been quick for us and the food is dropped off piping hot . one of our best experiences was on a football sunday and we ordered N worth of wings and pizza . it was enough to satisfy N of us ! 
wow what a surprise . authentic and spicy , i can ' t wait to go back .

fantastic pernil ( roast pork ) and friendly help -- plus they deliver ! 
lic market should consider expanding by buying out the lot next door cause i ' m tired of the long waits on the weekend ! i ' m such a fan of this place that i try to make it here at least once a month ! such good food for the price . yum yum yum ! 
N . N stars and for a michelin star restaurant , a mere disappointment again . maybe i ' m judging too harshly on these restaurants but when given the status accolade they supposedly deserve , i expect greater things . not realizing how tiny this venue was , i ' m glad they had bar jamon next door as my friend and i arrived an hour early and were kindly asked to go next door to have a drink or two . no problem w . that and the host was kind from the minute we entered to the minute he sat us down . there ' s a great selection of wines but pretty expensive . not sure if i saw N bottle of red white under N . we went w . the alta rioja tempranillo and to my liking , it was very dry . as for food , we ordered the below N . house-made pork charcuterie , spanish cheese , seasonal pickles N . fideos with chorizo and clams N . spanish mackerel with oysters escabeche and horseradish N . duck egg with mojama and black truffles N . foie gras with cinco cebollas N . oxtail stuffed piquillo peppers N . bone marrow with watercress and radishes N . crispy belly with sunchoke puree and confit artichokes N apps for N people was a nice light dinner . there were elements of each dish that were good but not one dish came together to my liking . i will start w . my favorites of the night because there wasn ' t that much to choose from . interesting pork charcuterie , perfectly cooked clams , crisp sear on the mackerel , velvety foie gras , and crispy pork belly were the highlights of the night . everything else was so so . i wish i had a better understanding of N as there were strange elements to that platter . chorizo was not prevalent in N . there was some acidic element w . N that overpowered the already lack in flavor of truffle . N was just plain and simple , nothing special . i was probably the most disappointed in N as the bone marrow was too gelatinous and def didn ' t melt in my mouth . overall , the food was ok at best for a regular restaurant , nonetheless a michelin star one . as for service , our waiter waitstaff was good but again , def not michelin caliber . he had a sourpuss face but thank god it didn ' t translate in the tone he was speaking w . never asking me if the meal was ok nor any of the floor mgrs maitre ' d was also surprising . instead , they were more in a rush to get us out to cater for the Npm table coming in . like i said , everything was just a-ok but nothing blew me away . . . . . . 
i ' m a big fan . this place does really live up to the yelp reviews . they were so great in waiting for the whole party to arrive for brunch . i have no idea how long we would have waited if the whole party was present , but they let us get seated after N mins while we waited for half the group . the smith ale really hit the spot while waiting and it being a hot summer day . bread basket comes with a strawberry cream cheese which i ' m convinced is philadelphia ' s brand . i got the jane burger which was really delicious - nice and juicy with the medium rare meat juices squeezing out everytime you take a big bite . loved it . friends got a variety of dishes - the steak and eggs was really good . meat was so tender . the benedict jane ( crab cake one ) wasn ' t good . if you are picky with crab cakes , do yourself a favor and don ' t order it here . the other benedict , i think the maple sausage one is better . the mac n cheese croquette is so crunchy i enjoyed it . but it ' s a pretty big piece so one is enough for a table to share . all in all , i would definitely go again with a group of friends . reservations and good food are sometimes tough to find for nyc brunch . 
an oyster bar with a setup similar to the old spaghetti factory . came here after a good day of shopping with a friend for christmas . loved the fact that nfl games were on at the bar area ! at close to N per oyster , this place has pretty conventional prices for oysters in new england . i ended up getting N N a dozen oysters . N gigamotos , N conduits , N delaware , and N new jersey . out of all of them , the gigamotos were the most tasty and the biggest ! i also ordered their new england clam chowder , which i have to say , is really authentic and has more clams than your average clam chowder ! we ended up sharing a guyere mac and cheese which was amazingly rich . it was the first time i had it and i really would like to try to make that from scratch ! for dessert , wed shared a maple whiskey bread cake , which was a great finish to this incredible meal ! overall a good experience and would come here again . 
awesome food . we stopped eating indian food at other places coz nothing else comes close to the tasty food prepared by these guys . my favorite is the crab masala and the mutton sukka . never have i eaten such perfect buttery nan ' s . chicken N is yet another fav in our family . very authentic flavors and the meat is always cooked to perfection . nothing comes close to the customer service that we have gotten from the folks who work there . my special thanks to allen and abhay who take customer service very seriously . place continue preparing such yummy food and thanks for great service ) 
foi grass ? lmgtfy anyway , ate at roberta ' s on a wednesday night around N N and found a seat at the bar ( inside ) right away . i was worried from reading other reviews here about the vibe from the staff , but quickly found it warm and helpful . had a salumi plate ( excellent ) , a sweetbread entree ( also excellent ) and the falco pie ( a take on traditional napels style salciccia i believe ) which was technically done well . to be fair , the only thing wrong with it was that i ' ve had the exact same pie in other restaurants and have been happier . nothing the pizziaolo can do about that , the pie was spot on crust-wise ( crispy , with a bit of char ) and a good ratio of sauce to toppings . with dinner i had planned on wine , but the bar had two of my favorite beers , so . . . hitachino white , and modelo especial . who doesn ' t like wine with dinner , but if you ' re really going to do pizza , in brooklyn , beer ' s the only way to go . the space is nice , just cozy enough without feeling too cramped , and i have to admit falling in love with the front . cash only here and an atm right out front ? pure nyc . that would never fly in sf , unless . . . plus the outside seating area is huge , about the square footage of the restaurant , and covered from the sun rain . overall , a great effort by a young-ish staff , and a wonderful addition to bushwick , and the rest of the borough . my only beef with this place , was that i had a great meal , and didn ' t bring anyone along to share it with . on my way out , i started thinking how my night would have been , had i walked in committed to the ideal that the whole scene was " too cool " . gad i let that go at the atm out front . 
simple , delicious food . really friendly waitstaff . it ' s a small place so might be a wait but it ' s worth it ! we had the cauliflower special ( our favorite ) , beef cubes and crab fried rice . all really good . 
must try chinese restaurant ! 
such a pleasure to have french food right here in bay ridge . kat , the chef , is trained in french cooking , and uses organic ingredients . she is a supporter of using local farms , and the result of all those fresh ingredients is a delightful meal . the staff was very nice , attentive but not overbearing knowledgeable but not haughty . definitely will go again ! 
i love almond ! i came on a busy friday night and at N N i didn ' t see a single table empty , glad i made a reservation . the mussels and blue fish appetizer were very good . loved how warm and friendly servers where too . delicious rack of lamb was the friday night special , cooked perfectly . the menu is huge ! lots to choose from , but it makes sense as the space is big . free billiards room with couches and warm lighting in the back ! what a great place ! 
i love brooklyn belly ' s food ! the jerk chicken and the bbq chicken are amazing . the chef makes it perfect you want it . the home-made sauce adds the perfect kick to it . best food to get full ! 
someone told me to come get dinner and i said great and then when i arrived realized this place wasn ' t the korean burrito place it used to be . now it had small plates and ham and some small entrees . this is all fine and i actually spent eight bucks on bread and butter ( it was great ) but eight bucks . . . after that i ordered pork buns those were really good , but like most people im not a nine dollar for two guy and then i had the beef tendon salad , which was light , good but nothing to write home about . i was just really surprised i guess , i ended up eating a table mates half a pork shoulder steak which was great but if i didnt have that it was because i was scared id spend too much and i never want that from a restaurant . seeing benton ' s country hams from tennessee on the menu was a plus though , that stuff is great , good to see david chang is ordering this kind of stuff for his restaurants . i don ' t know , maybe it will be better when i come with a fatter wallet . 
great food and service . deserts to die for . only negative was N gratuity added on even though there was seven in our party not the required eight
i came here a few weeks ago on a warm and sunny saturday for brunch . the restaurant has very spring feel to it , with long wide windows that allow in ample sunlight and on a day when there ' s a light wind outside , the atmosphere inside the restaurant is one of picnicing in the gardens . the service here is amazing as well . i ordered the ham crepe and my friend ordered the andouille sausage . both were very good , but they kind of skimped a bit on the toppings used . there was a lot more cheese than meat , and for what it costs , it would ' ve been nice if there was at least a bit more meat . it was the first time i ' d ever had a square crepe , so extra points for presentation and creativity . i really wish i had enough room for dessert because i have such a soft spot for strawberry and nutella crepes . but the crepes are pretty big and i was too full after brunch . i ' ll have to come back again sometime to try the sweet crepes . if the sweet crepes are as good as the savory ones , then i can ' t wait ! 
awesome ! so much history ! excellent food and spirits ! no better bar in the world . 
ate here once . food was good but my experience could have been better . 
want a good slice of pizza this is the place to get it ! 
i am so happy i found this little place , what a gem ! its a bright , cheery and very homey place that i unexpectedly discovered one day walking a different route than normal . great spot for coffee , lunch , delicious , quality food . i haven ' t tried dinner but i would like to . 
had the ramen here today . it wasn ' t horrible , but it definitely fell below average . sadly , there are so few options for ramen in the city , that i might come back if i was in the area . but that ' s highly unlikely . 
arrived without a reservation , they did not seem that happy to see us but after some confusion at the idea of giving us a table , they gave us a ok table , food is average , my bloody mary was watery , it ' s loud , hectic with not many itms on the menu that seemed healthy , the burgers my sister had was average , we most likely won ' t return . . . . this is no balthazars ! 
i ' ve been looking to try the gaslight for a while , after hearing favorable reviews from some friends . i came here with two friends before a show in center city and had a blast . we went around Npm , so it was pretty empty . i would imagine after Npm , the place is packed . we decided to go the ' share everything ' route . we started with tuna tartare , pork sauerkraut meatballs , the pickle board , bbq octopus salad , and the soft pretzel bites . all of them were great - my favorites being the pickle board and the soft pretzel bites . after much deliberation on our entrees , we decided on a pork short rib special and the chicken breast . we were going to try a different entree , but our waiter ( who was great ) described the chicken breast and raved about it . he really sold it , and it ended up being my favorite plate of the night . the skin gets insanely crispy , but the meat itself is still tender and moist . the short rib dish was also great , the addition of the creamy polenta and grilled pickled red onions made the dish deeply flavorful and rich . for drinks , i ordered the ' bebbo ' off of the cocktails menu , and boy was it good . my friends enjoyed their drinks as well . as i said earlier in my review , our waiter was phenomenal and the service in general was great ( the right amount of time in between dishes , etc . ) my only issue with my entire meal and experience was the environment . i think the restaurant is a little confused as to who it ' s audience is . the interior is this kind of dark , wooden , and mysterious ambience - which comes to a halt with the bar with N tvs all airing sports ( excited sports fans present . ) it just seems odd for the rest of the establishment to have more of a foodie upscale feeling , compared to the rowdier , sports crowd at the bar . can ' t wait to try brunch ! 
we have taken to agricola as our new local favorite restaurant . the food is excellent - the farm fresh vegetables could make for a meal themselves . and of course the entrees are brilliant . the service is very good and getting better , noticeably improved from the first few weeks . finally , the facilities are beautiful and create a great dining ambience . my favorite spaces to dine are adjacent to the kitchen or in the bar area on the tables by the window . i am pleased to recommend it to anyone , locals or visitors to princeton . enjoy . 
walk into a long bar area with a marble top . the vibe is friendly and upbeat . they have very good happy hour specials and dollar oyster nights . we enjoyed our drink at the bar and then moved to the dining area for dinner . we used a livingsocial deal and it worked out well . the food was good , nothing to rave about , but it was decent . the server was very attentive - almost too friendly . the bread was excellent . if i worked in the area and wanted to go for happy hour , i would go here . if i needed a place to take my parents and lived in the area , this would be a good option . but i wouldn ' t go out of my way to venture into univ city to go to dinner here considering how many amazing restaurants we have in the city . 
pad thai with pork boring . pad see ewe with mah mah noodles and chicken just ok . pad kee mao with mah mah noodles and chicken better than the previous two , but still nothing special . spicy here is not spicy at all , so dare ordering spicy ! very hot inside , no ac Nat least last tuesday , when i went ) . impersonal service . loud and dirty floors . 
way overpriced for burnt dry pizza and a skimpy ribeye- i don ' t understand this fascination at all
clarel is one of the best sales representatives that are out there . he is absolutely wonderful , very patient and knowledgeable about the products , which helps a great deal when buying several pieces of appliances . i could not ask for a better service , and the delivery is super quick , order today - deliver next day , thank you very much clarel for your kindness and professionalism ! ! ! 
excellent and interesting thai food in a comfortable space and easy location . 
the waitress said it was a tapas style . . . . . i went with my sister on a recent trip out east , we strolled in on a bustling friday night ( by recommendation of a " local " ) , got seated right away . service was quick the drinks were delish and the food was sooo yummy , big portions considering we were expecting small plates . the lobster mash potatoes was a enough for a meal alone . ate everything , the food is so yummy ! the ambience was great , love the design and layout . . . i will definitely be back . 
i like coming here when im in the area . i like the food -especially the roast beef , fries and their home fries . keep up the good work . 
hip , chic brunch spot on the border of greenwhich village and soho , the trendy decor and lounge music overhead won ' t distract you from the well made and tasty breakfast lunch food . the wait staff is friendly enough and the food is suprisingly filling ( despite the seemingly small portions ) . the meal for two ( N entrees , shared french toast , two coffees ) cost me N ( tax tip included ) a bit pricey for a two person brunch . although that ' s par for the course in an eatery of this ilk , in this day and age N can get you a lot more elsewhere . 
loved it ! a group of us split just about all of the appetizers , and they were all great . 
we were heading down from maine to dc today and needed a place to stop for lunch . there ' s a subway in the same shopping center but we decided to go with the local option . we were very impressed . loved their menu , the two people who attended to us were very friendly and personable , and both of the N sandwiches we ordered were exceptional . the lunch meat was high quality and high quantity . they also encouraged to try some of their samples and their chicken salad was delicious . we probably won ' t be able to go back there anytime soon but wanted to send them a good word . 
akamara modern with pork belly is to die for . the pork buns are tremendous as well . the only real knock on the place is the constant ( absurdly long at times ) wait . go at off hours to ensure reasonable seating . 
sud is amazing . my roommate and i have been there several times on many different nights of the week . . . whether it is busy or slow it is always a great experience . the staff is so friendly and personable . they are the classic example of " simple done right . " their menu may be modest , but that just means that everything they do is perfection . crostini is a must try and they always have an incredible special . in my opinion , the black truffle pasta is the best item on their menu . seriously , you can ' t go wrong here ! ! ! 
been here a few times . every time i go in the owner looks like he rather be eating cow shit than working in a pizzeria . the ambiance of the place feels like a cemetery . not very warm . not very friendly . i will admit that they have a decent slice for this area . i ' ve had better . anyway . i ' m done with this place . i ordered lunch for delivery for my wife and i . a wrap with fries . a chicken roll . and a N liter soda . for delivery . N minutes away . it takes them an hour to arrive . when the kid finally gets here . he ' s forgotten the fries , soda , and credit card reciept that i have to sign . i sign a piece of paper and write down N for his tip . i call this place and tell the guy about my fries , soda , and receipt . he tells me he ' s going to send the driver back out . driver comes back . with hour and half old french fries in a crumpled up bag . my warm soda . and a receipt that has more items on it than i ordered . i was charged N . N more than i should have . i didn ' t care about the N . i just agreed i wouldn ' t order here anymore . my wife wanted to call and complain . i thought maybe they had a delivery charge . that ' s why there was an extra item for N . i said leave it alone . after seeing free delivery on the menu . she of course had to call . when she told the guy about it he says oh those are old menus . we do have delivery charge . that ' s what pissed me off . this place is the typical new york jerk off who hates his job and life . i wouldn ' t recommend this place . especially with better places around the area . 
awesome ! great menu , food was top notch quality . presentation was unique and artistic , waitstaff was attentive . on my first visit i decided to come back . the specialty rolls were flavorful and fairly priced . the atmosphere is wonderful , clean , and warm . i highly recommend this place to any sushi lover
 ' eek ! methinks not ' - that ' s quite accurate , dear yelp . let me just tell you guys what my experience was at this place tonight it began with an immediate seating in a cool , relaxed environment . we ordered a few dishes , quickly prepared and served , each more delicious than the last . however , before we were finished with the last , a patron with a large live snake walked in and was seated immediately not far from me . yes , you read that right . a live snake . most of the customers were disturbed . we asked to moved , but the manager or owner ( i think ) talked us out of changing seats , further away from the gigantic live snake granted momo sushi shack is very small , so the furthest we could have been still too close for my taste . my boyfriend and i finished the rest of our meal very fast and we made our exit , thank god , relatively quickly . i find this laughable , disgusting , appalling and i just can ' t get the image of the snake out of my mind , slithering on the tables , yes , on the tables where we are supposed , as patrons , to enjoy our meal . i am writing this review to vent , because i cannot fathom the idea of what happened tonight , it is just not okey . tomorrow morning , at a more decent hour i am calling the health department and i am making a formal complaint . i have never felt so compelled to write a review about a bad restaurant experience as i do now i didn ' t even have a yelp profile before this . . . this is not my first time at this establishment the service is terrible . i apologize for my crude honesty , but i just had to get it out there . god bless . 
been coming here on and off for over a year . a friend of mine from portland turned me onto this place as we rode by one day and he freaked out when he saw the sign ( in a good way ) . long story short , i may not know much about coffee but i know good coffee when i see it , and bodhi has it . aside from the coffee the service is excellent , never had an off day anytime i ' ve stopped by . 
i debated whether or not to write a review of the marshal because i had such a great experience there and i selfishly don ' t want it to become so popular that i can ' t get a table , but alas here i am writing my very first yelp review . i had an unbelievably tasty meal at the marshal - from the delicious chicken to the flavorful bread salad to the amazing corn on the cob with butter and cheese . next time i ' m going to make sure i leave room for dessert because that , too , looks incredible . also , the people who run and work at the restaurant could not be nicer . 
i ordered swiss steak burger , cobb salad and banana milkshake . they are good if u don ' t care much about calories . i was told to wait for the seat for twenty minutes . luckily , they table ran so fast . i got a table within ten minutes . the food went so fast after we ordered like ten minutes . if you like the crowded place . this is good . 
to be honest the hot dog isn ' t that special , but i always come here when i ' m in philly . i ' ve only gotten the texas hold em which combines some of my favorite core food groups in hot dogs , bacon , cheese and bbq sauce for example . it ' s pretty good , that ' s about it . the fries are much better comparatively , and they are probably why i keep coming back for more . they are served in a cool funnel which makes it more interesting to eat for some reason . i also enjoy the numerous sauces that are available , most of which slip my mind at the moment . the joint is a fun place to eat right on south street and enjoy a good ole hot dog with some interesting toppings . it ' s not cheap , it ' s probably not gonna blow your mind , but i think you ' ll enjoy yourself . 
meh . kind of a nice atmosphere for brunch on sunday . sunny and open . my omelet was just okay , not real flavorful and somehow not real hot either . i was with three other people though , and they all liked their stuff , including the crazy fried israeli bread thing they serve ( i forget the name ) , which i tried and admit was really good . it had a fried , doughy feel vaguely reminiscent of a pupusa . service was kind of iffy , though not bad . i really like nonstop coffee during brunch , but here i had a to wait for refills a couple times . 
oh , yelp , let me give half stars , would ya ? solid N . N . i kinda hate that everyone loves this place because it would probably shoot up a star if it weren ' t so busy all the time - just not the kind of place that i want to wait for a table . i ' ve been told the food is good , but the chicken sandwich i had was pretty terrible i didn ' t even eat it . i decided to take it home just in case to be polite but even on my second attempt i couldn ' t do it . beer was good , nice selection . the waiter brought me the wrong beer at one point , but he wasn ' t immediately available and i decided i liked it well enough that i kept it . he did realize his mistake much later and came back to sort of creepily whisper in my ear " that ' s totally the wrong beer " - and i explained i knew , but it was fine . extra points for him bringing me the correct beer and not charging me for it . 
the two-star rating lists in brief summary " meh . i ' ve experienced better . " and " meh " is exactly how i feel after trekking down to obao for their ' michelin recommended ' pho bo . first off this is an asian fusion restaurant . it is not a vietnamese place , nor is it a pho joint . you will open your menu to review the pho options only to find the most remarkable thing a lack of options to choose between . there is " pho bo " it is good enough for obao , so it is good enough for you . welcome , neighbor . enjoy your beef , if you can . there are some minor additions that you can tack on for an extra fee , but there is absolutely no core variety . you want some tripe ? sorry . tendon ? not here . looking for pho dac biet ? elsewhere , sirs and madams , for this is not your place . you will not see condiments at the table . chili paste is absent . culantro , when provided with your pho , is of the tiniest possible sprig barely enough to season a few spoonfuls . dollops of sriracha and hoisin sauce are given because they presume that ' s what uneducated people think pho is all about . you will get bean sprouts . if you like bean sprouts , you will be well pleased bean sprouts are about to happen . but should they be the memorable part of your pho ? i think not at all . lime ? a quarter-share of an undersized specimen , and count yourself fortunate . let ' s move to the heart of the pho - the broth . without a solid broth , pho is nothing . my broth tonight was deeply unfulfilling . the broth ought to be rich , teeming with delicious fats and flavors extracted by simmering marrow-filled bones into well-rendered stock . what i actually got was a pale , tepid impersonation , flavorless to the point of being tap water , and if it saw a marrow-bone at all , it was only to have one dragged through for the need to honor the form of the thing . i have made richer soups from bouillon cubes . i have tasted better stock from a can . so disappointing , when i had my heart set on pho . next we discuss the meat . keep in mind that if you ' re used to thin slices of rare meat atop your pho , you ' re usually ordering " tai " with the rubbery meatballs , " bo vien " plain " pho bo " is just pho with beef ( unspecified ) involved in some way . if this sounds unappetizing , it is because it is so . the meat was overdone , having sat too long either in the broth or under lamps for temperature control the texture , rubbery the flavor , absent . certainly not dispersed through the broth , such as it was . last , the noodles . these were a thin vermicelli type of unremarkable origin . texture , flavor , and doneness were all fine . i have nothing clever to say about the noodles aside from openly wondering if they were boiled in water i was later served in lieu of proper broth . noodles happened . they were not enough to earn favor . tonight i am a sad man . i add a single star above the minimum purely because the thai iced tea was passable , even though by the taste i feel it sure came from a mix i know well from my local asian grocery . N a glass more like six packets for N , add water . but it ' s new york . we accept a near N food tax on our dinners . i will not let N tea dissuade me from enjoying the one bright flavor of my evening . 
amazing square pizza . best i ' ve ever had . tomato sauce is sooooo delicious . wish i lived closer so i could visit this place regularly . 
our favorite takeout in chelsea . favorites include the fish tacos and the bruised short rib tacos . 
was good when they first opened , but the food has really gone downhill . recent order of fried clams rubbery and inedible . other dishes mediocre . the raw bar is still good . 
crab pizza ? ? ? ? ? i came here with a friend in need of something quick to eat . they a good selection of pizza , including crab . i personally have never seen a crab pizza in my life , but i love crab so of course i ordered this . it was wonderful , in addition to the new york pizza being freaking delicious , they had to top it off with crab , which is also freaking delicious , making a doubly freaking delicious meal . i would love to come back here the next time i visit nyc . my only complaint would be the lack of places to sit because this eatery is very small , but most places in nyc are like this , so it ' s not a huge deal . anyway , i hope this crab pizza idea picks up and moseys its way over to california so i can get it again sooner ! ! ps . i hear the sicilian is really good . i think i ' ll get that next time ) 
love the environment , but let ' s be real - this place is heavy on the asian population . drinks are reasonably priced , it ' s not extremely crowded , but it ' s not completely empty either . the atmosphere is fun and bathroom lines aren ' t ridiculously long . the owner also seems really nice . funny incident though , outside , when a big group of what looked like N-year-old ( caucasian ) kids felt bored enough to ( for no reason ) run their bodies into random people on the street and try to start something . really ? you don ' t have anything better to do ? go home to your mothers . anyways , will be back ! 
i was born in poland and lived there for years before moving to the states permanently . for someone who has tried authentic polish food all around poland ( north , south , and in between ) and whose parents make homemade polish food i was slightly disappointed . my parents came to visit for the day so i wanted to give them a day off from cooking and brought them here ( it was highest rated on here , and one of the few polish places open on sundays ) . i was a little surprised to see an american kraft single melted on top of the veal i ordered , and the polish meatballs were too soft the potatoes sprinkled with dill were great , but i wish the beet salad ( buraczki ) didn ' t taste like they came straight out of a jar . overall , the size to price of meal ratio is great . i went with N other people and the bill came to around N and we all still had to ask for boxes . this place is also byob . i highly recommend walking right across the street to the deli that serves cold beer and buy some zywiec , tyskie , or okocim beer to compliment your experience here . to sum up my experience lomzynianka is a bit americanized to cater to the population . from what i hear pierogis are what to get . not a good place for groups wth more than N people . large quantity of food at a great price . friendly service . bring beer ! 
my husband says , " i give this place N thumbs up ! " my mom and dad knew of this place from work meetings and weddings but never tried their lobster buffet . you do have to dress up in a jacket though , which is pretty high class . the buffet was about N but it was well worth it . they had this never ending heating tray of lobsters . even though people were in their jackets , it was no joke when it came to the lobsters . people were piling like N-N half-lobsters on their plates ! ! we probably ate N-N lobsters each . their cold entrees included a lot of seafood , and loads of loads of oysters were staring you in the face when you walked into the buffet area . if you love seafood this is heaven . they had lots of other carving meats and entrees but this was damn good . just hit the lobsters and some of the seafood you got your money ' s worth . the drinks were very affordable . i got the strawberry champagne for N-N and very very affordable for a place with jackets . now everytime i come home my mom always asks me , do you want to go to the manor ? ? of course . . . problem is that everyone knows this place is so awesome that it ' s difficult to get a reservation especially on holidays . don ' t even get me started on the desserts . again if you died and went to heaven and love anything sweet , this is the dessert selection of your dreams ! ! ! again , N thumbs up ! we can ' t wait to take our relatives there . see . . . there is something good about nj . we ' re not all about the turnpike and full service cheap gas . 
the name is pretty nice for a colombian restaurant , however the food not so much . i wanted to try this place out for the first time since i live in town and i started with an empanada de carne ( beef ) i did a to go order , once i got home i sat down and when i opened the bag the empanada was so greasy the oil was literally pouring out of the empanada . . i honesty wouldn ' t recommend this place if the empanada has all the grease i can only imagine a chicharon ! ? . 
i have been going here or having takeout from here with my family since before i can remember . over N years later , and no longer living in morrisville , every time i get to come back is a real treat . this town has no shortage of great pizzerias but originals is , in my book , the best . the service is friendly , the prices are reasonable , and the food is excellent . i particularly like the sandwiches from here , such as the chicken parm or the pizza steak . there were years where i ' d eat pizza from here every friday and a sandwich every saturday . not the healthiest , i admit , but boy was it satisfying . now that i ' m grown and living out of the immediate area it can be a long while between visits . sure enough , when i go in to pick up my pizza , sal ( the owner ) remembers me and asks about my family . not much more to say than that definitely try this place if you get a chance . 
fabulous decor , prompt service , delicious food in reasonable portions . i ' ll come here again the next time i ' m in philly . 
hmm a N . N . pros no wait , your meal includes a juice mini cocktail , they give you a bread basket ( we got N ) with the signature pink butter . is pink butter something all brunch uws places give out ? because i like that ! ! i got the huevos rancheros and it was pretty good , but there were too many leaves . i finished the plate pretty quickly , as there wasn ' t enough food ( and i eat super slowly ! ) . my friend wasn ' t filled up with his omelet , either , and said it was too salty . pretty quick service , and you can dine inside or outside . 
i ' m in nyc on assignment from tokyo , where i ' ve lived for N years . if you shot me with a tranq dart , blindfolded me , flew me to nyc from tokyo , took me into sakagura , and then woke me up , i ' d have no idea we weren ' t still in japan . the only giveaways are the english signage ! sakagura is absolutely my favorite restaurant in nyc . 
we went with a group of N on a saturday night and had a superb meal with friendly and top notch service . several of our group had lived in london and hadn ' t had great indian food since moving back to the u . s . until eating here . the dosas were delectable , crisp , hot delicious with wonderful and creative chutneys and sauces . this is not your tired , out of the jar stuff . they are handmade with fresh and vibrant spices . everything we had was spiced as requested those who wanted hot got it just the way they wanted and the " less heat " versions did not mean bland . the complex spices were still present even without the heat . don ' t miss the goat curry , the table ' s favorite , but the okra curry , eggplant curry and the tandoori breads rocked it as well . i know , who orders dessert in an indian restaurant ? you should here . they served us a dessert sampler plate that blew us away . the service was awesome , our waiter double checked with the kitchen in every order to make sure our gluten free friend stayed gluten free while she ate . he helped us choose quantities which is hard with a large group and didn ' t let us order too much or too little . great place and not to be missed ! 
delicious , great food prepared by an incredibly kind and funny woman . best cart out there . 
we have never dined inside the restaurant so this review is based on delivery only and i have to say , royal palace is the worst restaurant for delivery . the are consistently late , this last time we waited an hour and half and another time we waited N hours , and the food is nothing to write home about because it is always cold . the person who answers the phone always says it will be N minutes , it never is , and then when you call back it is always the same excuse " we are busy " but then the driver will tell you he got lost . . . . they just don ' t care , never compensate and can sometimes be downright rude when you bring it their attention . we have given this restaurant too many chances to get better and this last time was the final straw . almost N hours late and then the order was wrong to boot . we give up . 
nice paneer masala dosa . . . it was not just paneer spread with dosa . it was a separate masala altogether . aloo tikki chat was good too . 
the food here is good . one of my favorite restaurants in the city is caracas , and as far as venezuelan food goes this place is almost as good . the food is decently priced , though some items are a bit expensive , and the food is tasty . the fried items are crispy and served hot . though i wish the arepas came out a bit crispier . the only complaints i have are that this place is almost too dark , so much so that i couldn ' t really read the menu . also , the food took forever to come out and when it did my dishes were served a good five minutes after everyone elses ( at this point we must have waited N-N for the food to come out . ) overall , a good place to grab a bite . 
i was so surprised this place wasn ' t packed ! my girlfriends and i came here saturday for brunch . my one gf who lives in philly recommended gaslight and i will definitely be coming back on my next trip ! the decor was neat and rustic but again kind of empty . our server was very nice and attentive so we were never waiting long for anything . we started off with a round of mimosas and the daily cheese plate . we were also served complimentary sticky bread . i ordered the waffamul which was ridiculously large but very tasty . one friend got the fried chicken biscuit and the other got the crab benny . everyone ' s portions were large and we all cleaned our plates ! the chipotle sauce on the breakfast potatoes was delicious . 
went in wanting pho on a cold afternoon . not bad , but not the greatest bowl of pho i ' ve ever had . but , since i live in a neighborhood without many asian options , it was still pretty good . 
decor - N . N stars , small and cute but very cosy food - N stars service - N stars , everyone pitched in and made our experience a friendly , family like one drinks - N . N stars , above average wine list las ramblas , i ' m sorry to have to do this to you but very dissappoing . expected more . . . . like what i might find on the streets of las ramblas . i feel bad if our earnest waitress reads this and i really liked her but the food does not lie . place is small but cosy and invitiing . the wine list is above average , prices are a tinge high for such a small place . service was excellent ! on to the food . . . . . . . . . . shrimp in garlic white wine - pretty good , probably the best thing we had that night . sauteed wild mushrooms - not what i was looking for and didn ' t have that fragrant mushroom taste , more oversauced than anything . spanish red peppers stuffed with saffron rice , morcilla manchengo cheese - this one sounds delicious right ? nope . the red peper skin was thin and soggy and not thick and crunchy like red bell peppers stuffed with things . the cheese in it was overwhelming and pretty much masked everything else in there . fried smelts - forgot what that tasted like but def not good . ensalada costa brava - dressing was tart and overwhelmed everything it was tossed in . serrano ham cheese - this was average . had some other dishes but these popped out at me . our tab ended up being over N with wine . truthfully , the wine probably constituted a large part of the bill . honestly , i haven ' t been disspointed by that many dishes in a long time . we kept waiting for more or a redeeming dish to understand why we ' d been recommended the place . sadly , none came . everything was average to not good . we went based on the recommendations of a friend but it really didn ' t come close to our expectations . 
huge fan ! finally cc has a fast , healthy alternative lunch spot . i ' ve been here N times since opening and each time it ' s gotten better ! those first one-star reviews must have been during the craziness of opening weekend - yes the lines waits were long and the staff was still learning , but that ' s what you have to expect on an opening week . now that things are starting to settle town these guys are refining their craft and learning to efficiently work through their proceeses . the food is fantastic , especially if you order what you want like i do each time . the touch screens allow you to pick and choose according to your tasting and the ingredients are just as fresh as advertised . if you want a great salad for lunch , this is the place to go and i ' ll be back frequently . 
never again , stopped here for beers before meeting some friends at tengda . i used to be a huge fan of this place until our last visit . we waited way too long just to get N beers , and the reason why , the wannabe jersey shore douche bartender was too busy taking shots with two trashy women . and management don ' t you worry , none of these shots were paid for . on top of this , we couldn ' t even get to the bar because there was a N year old sitting there with his mother ( illegal in ct . ) and the icing on the cake , this child got to watch the bartender take multiple shots as he was fortunate enough to be sitting next to the to trashy women . management needs to wake the hell up in this place . 
the place is great ! i have been coming here for years and have been very happy , it is the best place in chinatown . the food here is nothing like your average take out place . the dishes have tons of flavor . if you go you have to get the roti with the chicken peanut dipping sauce as an appetizer . it was so good i could have eaten that as an entree . for an entree i usually get the sizzling beef , it has a great sauce and fresh veggies , and the meat is tender . the only down side is the waitresses don ' t speak english very well and many times i have to go over my oder with them N-N times to ensure that it is correct , but other than that its great . 
came here for a first date back in april N . got suckered into ordering guacamole when the server suggested it . . . and got tagged N for it ! i got some unsatisfying tacos and my date got some ceviche dish . not worth it . 
my husband and i come here all the time . the service is always spot on and the specials never disappoint . they always have unusual things that i love to try and i never regret it and believe me , i am not a " special " kind of gal . ( i just prefer to order menu items , i don ' t know why ) . the garlic bread fondue is the bomb and their chicken pot pie ( special ) is fabulous . my favorite neighborhood restaurant . 
this was one of the longest , most unsatisfying meals i ' ve ever had . there were three of us last night . we started with trying to order water . apparently , there is something going on with the water in bloomfield , so we ordered bottled water . fine . it was only downhill from there . the service was awful . it took nearly half an hour following our order before the soup arrived ! and this was only after we asked for it . entrees followed one at a time , waitstaff disappeared , or refused to make eye contact . the special request we made for our dessert wasn ' t honored . then . . . the food . we are thai food aficionados , and were delighted to try a new ( to us ) thai restaurant . oh no . the soups , which were mediocre at best , were the best part of the meal . two of the three of us had entrees that simply weren ' t very good . a curry with tofu was hot ( though we had requested mild ) without having much flavor . the fried tilapia special may as well have been fish sticks in a bland brown sauce . ( to be fair , one of us had a chicken pad see yew that he enjoyed hence two stars above rather than one . ) they even managed to mess up my favorite dessert mango with sticky rice . we had asked for the coconut sauce on the side the dish arrived with coconut sauce on the rice . the mango seemed canned , if that is even possible . ( the sticky rice was pretty good , though . ) if the food were good , the service issues would matter a little less . unfortunately , this food was not worth the wait . and no apologies for the crappy service , either . just avoidance . really rude . we eat thai food all the time , and have plenty of options here . we will not be coming back to boonsong . 
i have been coming here for a little over a year . i first came here on a friends recommendation as i am a huge fan of ramen . almost every time we go , usually at night , there is about a N hour wait . the wait is no big deal since there are a few pubs and bars in the area so waiting goes by pretty fast . the place itself is quite small which is good in a way as you get to know the cooks a little better . they have seats at the bar and a few tables in the back . they have a pretty limited selection to just different types of ramen . i have tried all the different variations of ramen here and personally i prefer the regular miso ramen . the broth is amazing in all the different variations and they have options to select additional items to be put in the ramen . overall , i cant find another comparable place to this place , and the best part is its cheap ! ps if your friends are meeting up with you here , make sure they all show up before your name is called or else you most definitely get bumped from the list . ive gotten bumped a few times , but they put us back on the list . also there is a rack above the bar to put your belongings . 
went for a comedy show . what a great time ! food was great , beer was good ( even though i am not a big beer drinker ) the comics were great . they had us laughing the whole time ! once the show was over we tried to decide where to get next . after deciding on a bar down the road we headed up stairs took one look at the back room and stayed all night . we played fooseball , darts , pool and had a great time . i wish i could give N stars . see you soon ! ) 
never ! ! ! its a bad taco spot
holy cow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this sushi was wonderful . i arrived there sorta late i guess on a saturday night but my timing was perfect as i was able to get a table by the fountain . they of course had regular sushi but they also had some very interesting sushi sauce combinations . the tuna and avocado with yuzu butter sauce stands out in my mind . the tuna was arranged to look like a blooming rose in the middle of the plate and then the avocado was beautifully cut and arranged to look like the leaves surrounding the rose and then the sauce was perfectly poured around it . supremely delicious ! ! ! the other standout for me was the kumamoto oysters . being from florida i know a little something about oysters and these were amazing . they were so fresh , so crisp and the wasabi cocktail sauce they made and applied to the top was in the proper proportion . yes in the end it was a little pricier than some other places i could have gone to however the quality of the food and the service made every single penny worth it with no problem . 
excellent N-N happy hour with decent service once we figured out who our waitress was . the interior struck me as a bit odd and worn down ( with the weirdest music videos playing - solidly entertaining ) . we ordered a few happy hour offerings , N salad with ginger-avocado dressing , the " kfc " koji fried chicken , and the koji roll which should have been spicy tuna and crab on the inside , tuna and salmon on the outside . ( i got something covered with avocado and spicy mayo instead , hmm . ) overall , the dining experience was fairly good but nothing to absolutely rave about . the cocktails and sake-tinis looked particularly interesting but i ' ve given up alcohol for the month ( wahhhh ) so i ' ll have to try ' em again some other time . 
food was mediocre . i ' m not sure i was going back . 
always been a fan of prime N . have been frequenting the new haven location for years , and we were delighted when a suburban location opened ! had a terrific dinner there tonight , but was very disappointed when , after paying our bill with a gift card we received , our waitress returned to tell us they were unable to accept said gift card , as they were not yet set up for gift cards ! she brought the manager over , who apologized . . . made some excuses . . . and did nothing else to accommodate us ! i even asked him to call the gift card number in to the new haven location and have them process it ! he shook his head--no ! not quite sure why-- ( N ) they are so far behind in their gift card processing ( N ) the manager didn ' t even have the courtesy to say , " hey , we apologize for this huge inconvenience to you . . . come back next time for a complimentary beer " ! ( N ) with the same owner , they couldn ' t call in my gift card number to new haven location to process ! we had a lovely evening as a family , and won ' t let this ruin that ! we will continue to patronize prime N . however , we were extremely disappointed at how the manager handled the situation ! poor business ethic ! 
a nice place for a casual brunch . nice parmesan biscuits with sausage gravy and the french toast which i thought was delicious . unfortunately it was uncomfortably warm inside the place even though we were sitting away from the open kitchen . 
went there N Npm last thursday . waited about N mins . awesome yakitori . 
what happened ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! for years jimmies has been our long time favorite restaurant . as children growing up in bpt we started going to jimmmies before it was even a building-mostly a hot dog stand . after the restaurant was built we enjoyed dining in ( waitresses and customer service left a lot to be desired , though ) but mostly took food out and sat by the water and ate . we did this for years and years-and became known as " regulars " at the take out counter . however though we noticed that the quality of the food had started to go down . we always got the fried shrimp and either they tasted like wads of paper or like iodine ( research says that indicates they are not fresh ) long story short we moved south N years ago and on our trip back to ct . recently we gave jimmies one more try and it was the absolute worse . the fried shrimp were soggy and the fries were grease soaked and the salad greens were old and dry . we were disappointed but not surprised . . after asking friends and relatives here in ct if they still enjoyed going to jimmies the comments were all the same . . . . " . soggy shrimp " . . . . " jimmies has gone down " . and for our last visit there i would give it N N star . . . for the bottle of sprite . it was ice cold and help wash down the greasy soggy shrimp . 
ordered kale salad gnocchi scallops and meatballs . all wonderful flavors ! all delicious ! ! smaller portions with a price but totally worth it and great to share and try different things . everything on the menu looks great and will be back to try more ! 
this has to be one of my favorite places ! ! i was introduced in N and i haven ' t stopped going . everyone that i ' ve introduced to this place loves it too . the food is great and the price is great , especially for such great food ! i ' ve gone on intimate dates here , just for a good meal with my girlfriends , and staff party . the wait staff here are the best . if your looking for a nice cozy spot with good food and good drinks this is the spot for you . 
it is a diner in an airport , yet it has that diner feel , the food is not bad at all . service was efficient and to the point . decor is adorably " faux diner " we ordered a platter with eggs , hash browns , toast ( hold the bacon ) and they gave us fruit instead . it was substantial and well , tasted exactly like you would expect it to taste . price ? N something . i asked the server if coffee was included and she said no , and went on to talk about something else , i had wanted to order an iced tea instead if it was , because i don ' t drink american coffee . she came with coffee - i hadn ' t really ordered it and she never clarified but i figured i would drink it anyway . for black american coffee it was ok . i didn ' t appreciate however the N . N charge for it . . attention to detail when taking orders would be nice . we also had to ask if we could substitute bacon for something else and that is when she said we could , we weren ' t asked if we wanted to . these are the reasons it went from N to N stars . i know it is in a busy airport but it wasn ' t busy when we went . at all . all in all , pretty good ! 
outstanding sushi ! john is amazing . 
rounding up to N stars from N N N . . . mainly because it ' s like a freaking pizza ranch on the bar side - crowded picnic tables , difficult to navigate , toddlers running around , loud . that said , sometimes that ' s what you want and the bartenders are awesome ( always a good pour , always friendly and professional ) , so it probably balances out if you ' re in the right mood . the restaurant side is bustling too but it ' s way less chaotic . my favorite new haven pizza , hands down . i will never get the fuss over pepe ' s and sally ' s and modern . bar consistently serves up better pizza - better sauce , better and fresher toppings , better crust ( chewy with just the right amount of crisp ) . 
hands-down my favorite non-pizza restaurant in new haven . i freakin ' love this place , and i ' m a vegetarian , and they have hardly any vegetarian offerings . . . but still . you ' ll feel like you ' re in france . they have palm beer on draught . the wine list is superb . they have the greatest mac and cheese in the universe ! ! ! and i have dreams of their cup of chocolate . the staff amazing . the ambiance unlike anything in town . just go . you ' ll need a reservation , and if there are four of you , ask for the " cave . " 
they have the tastiest , most delicious spicy hot chocolate the world has ever known . it is thick and creamy and such a delectable kick . it ' s my ultimate guilty pleasure . frequented the place often when it was chocopologie , but now am pretty excited it ' s a bar ! very small space , really intimate and adorable . none of that crazy noise from N people in a huge bar . super cute . hand crafted chocolates delivered freshly made , so you gotta get there early before they run out because they go fast . no mass stocking of mass produced crap . i love this place for the spicy hot chocolate alone , but the rest makes it absolutely charming . a hidden treasure . 
seriously ? people like this place ? burnt coffee . bland eggs benedict w a muffin so tough that i could barely cut it w a knife . then paired w spicy-ish hash browns is a terrible combo . hubs had huevos ranchero w the tortilla oddly on top . then the salsa came out of the microwave ? ? ? boiling hot . who nukes salsa ! ! ! ! ! ! it was a bizarre experience to say the least . will never go back . i usually agree w fellow yelpers but not even remotely on this . yuck . 
there are few good places in new haven for breakfast so i ventured to georgie ' s in west haven and was pleasantly surprised . clean , good priced and solid , but somewhat plain , food with some unexpected things like organic eggs and wifi . great service . i definitely would recommend . 
the first time i came here was right after sandy and there was no line . . . so when my friend in town asked if i could pick up some macarons for his gf , i didn ' t think much about it . i went over around N Np on a saturday . the line was outside the store down the block toward Nth ( not yet around the corner ) . i think i finally got into the store around N Np and then ordered N macarons for her and N ( vanilla and pistachio ) for me and my plus one . the weather wasn ' t bad so the wait was bearable . i probably wouldn ' t have braved the line for myself . i never really got into macarons because my first experience trying them the macarons were stale ( i waited too long to open to box ) . this time , they were weren ' t stale ! so light--i really like the vanilla one . colored macarons kind of freak me out , i ' m not sure why . total came out to N for the N macarons . 
this place has such potential ! i want it to be better than it is . the wine selection is extensive , but limited to italian wines . i really haven ' t managed to work out the intricate wine laws , regions , grapes , and indications of quality in all of italy , so i was hoping i could rely on the staff . not so , my friends . not so . the waiter was undertrained and tried to bullshit his way though my fairly basic questions like , " are there any other primitivo ' s on the list ? " or " what is a super tuscan ? " i understand that we all look young , but ti would have been helpful if he had consulted , rather than making things up . i tried not to notice the homeworkless expression on his face , and agreed . yes , a super tuscan is probably not worse than a tuscan . just nod . the prices are also on the steep side . my friend ordered the tuna special , which rang in at N - about a N difference from the other entrees . we finished one bottle of primitivo , which was great , but our well intentioned waiter recommended a chianti classico for the second . when five pay for , but do not finish a N bottle of wine , it is the sign of a shitty wine . there are few really bad wines in the world , most are just boring , but this was oaked past drinkability . when we asked for a fruity , primitivo-like wine , this was the opposite of what we had in mind . it would be nice if they had something besides italian wine , or at least listed their wine menu on the internet . if it were public , i could research the wines beforehand and come up with a battle strategy . when restaurants don ' t do that , people tend to rely on the staff , which was evidently something bin N was not prepared for last friday . when i plan on spending over N on a wine , i want to know a little bit about it . wine is the most variable alcoholic drink on the planet , and it can be horrible ( apparrently ) or fantastic . i like to know where my money is going . also , parking is a bitch . hail a cab . at least we made reservations , so that wasn ' t an issue . in short , they need to train their staff or hire some somelliers , because i seriously doubt that one works there . 
had a really good time on saturday night . kitchen was opened late and the ginger wings were great . music was a mix of old school hip hop and top N ' s . lychee martini was good just a little too sweet . might come back during the week instead of the weekend to actually be able to sit and eat at a table . 
the place is great . staff is very attentive and knowledgable about drinks and food options . i just could not handle how spicy the food was . i guess i ' m a wuss about that stuff . otherwise , everything was fine . 
very promising new thai restaurant by the same owners behind the solid land . the noodles and small plates are wonderful and authentic . the decor is super cool . service is friendly and enthusiastic . 
best sandwiches ever ! without a doubt an authentic feeling when stepping in and the staff is extra friendly and attentive . their cold cuts are super fresh and never slimy and i always rave about how they have the best balsamic vinaigrette i ' ve ever had . my co-workers and i all agree that this is definitely at the top of our list for local delis . 
disappointing is an understatement ! ! i had been dying to go to amy ruth ' s , every time i passed by the line was crazy out the door . i thought that i was missing out on some amazing food ! ! ! maybe i should ' ve had the fried chicken . . . instead i went for the ribs . . . this was not ok , the bbq sauce tasted store bought like the one you get when you order chinese delivery . . . the corn bread was good , mashed potatoes ok and mac and cheese was my favorite . i have no intentions on going back , i felt cheated . the food wasn ' t good at all , we had a bunch of leftovers and didn ' t take them home bc we knew we weren ' t going to eat them . will not go back , and definitely won ' t recommend it . totalfail
 northern spy food co . has a local , seasonal , rustic , and hipster feel it reminds me a lot of the great casual but still very high quality neighborhood restaurants in portland , oregon northern spy food co . is a small neighborhood restaurant located in the east village . it has a real local and hipster feel--both in the menu , which features a lot of local and seasonal ingredients , as well as the decor , which features a small , intimate , rustic , and casual look . once you walk outside the restaurant , you are greeted with a small city-esque street of quaint residences and greenery . northern spy food co . definitely seems to fit with its neighborhood . for dinner , northern spy food co . features a lot of the shared small plates that are popular right now as well as reasonably priced entrees that showcase the ingredients of the season moment as well as proteins from very well respected farms ( like the pennsylvania based lamb farm elysian fields , which also supplies lamb to the french laundry ) . on sundays , a sunday supper menu is available--a N-course dinner at a reasonable price of N per person . i went for brunch , which showcases a small but nice sounding menu . there are housemade pastries as well as hash , waffles , quiches , and breakfast sandwiches . i opted for their b . l . e . t . , which was a breakfast take on a blt . the sandwich featured toasted and hearty rye bread as well as a baked egg , tomato , aioli , and bacon . the sandwich had similarities to the fried egg sandwich at santa monica ' s huckleberry . northern spy food co . tops that huckleberry breakfast sandwich with their bacon . the bacon had a great flavor , but there was less fat , which resulted in a meatier flavor . despite the less fat , it was still very flavorful and smoky and there was still a good crispiness to go with the meaty chewiness . all the other ingredients were good . i liked the flavor of the rye bread , but i think some might find it a little dominating or overwhelming . the huckleberry sandwich though features really leafy arugula and very good and stretchy gruyere so i would still give the edge to that west coast sandwich . northern spy food co . ' s b . l . e . t . also featured a fresh greens salad and home fries . i tried a little bit of their housemade blueberry scone and it was very good . i am not a fan of scones because they tend to be dry and a little lacking in flavor . the scone here was nearly perfect though . it had a very good fruity center that was also soft and not dry . it also maintained the nice crunch of a great scone . service was pleasant and quick . brunch prices were reasonable as almost all of their brunch entrees were below N and generous in portion size . dinner and sunday supper prices also seem reasonable . as mentioned , the decor has a very intimate and intentionally homey and slightly small look . it makes this restaurant feel like the perfect place to be a regular . northern spy food co . is a good spot for brunch . its casual but still high quality food is a nice contrast to a lot of the high-end and formal restaurants you will find in manhattan . it is definitely one to consider for brunch if you are staying with friends in this area of new york . if you are going to be in this area for a long time or live in this part of the city , i would say it is also probably worth a try for dinner and sunday supper . i am not sure what the parking situation is . i think you should be able to find free street parking . there is also a subway stop not too far from here . 
impersonal curt service - no charge tahini sauce - apparently they don ' t have any undercooked , greasy , side of falafel - N . N deplorable disgusting . 
my friends took me here for a special birthday dinner and we had a wonderful experience . please note , i highly recommend placing a reservation . our table was ready and waiting the moment we arrived . martinis are important in my world and they did not disappoint . i like mine dirty and appreciate when they have a hint instead of a slap in the face of olive brine . i ' d been told that they are known for their raw bar , so we all agreed to share the le grand . this tower of seafood bliss , turned heads and changed my feeling about oysters forever . before this experience , i ' d always shunned oysters . something about the texture . i decided to try again and discovered the beauty of what i ' d been missing out . i ' d never had razor clams either and tried those for the first time . wonderful ! for dinner , steak au poivre . perfect of course . the side of spinach and frites , equally as dreamy . my sister had the skate , which she let me sample . it was a perfect blend of crispy sear , buttery smoothness and flakey scallop-like finish . i wanted more ! however , we moved on to a perfect desert of warm chocolate cake . they even placed a candle in honor of my birthday , very sweet . the gesture , that is . the cake had wonderful restraint . it wasn ' t overly chocolate . everything about this meal was in balance . here ' s what i appreciated most about my time here . the service . they never rushed us . we were allowed to savor each course and enjoy some conversation between , during and after our meal . the water was always filled and even when one of the martini glasses had a chip in it , they quickly corrected it and gave us one on the house . this place is first class without making you feel uncomfortable . i would love to come back here someday . 
it used to be a great restaurant , but it has changed for worse . my last visit ( for sunday brunch ) was a complete fiasco . service was sloppy , and the food left much to be desired . we ordered our steaks cooked to medium and they were overcooked and dry . another friend and i ordered eggs and they looked as if they had been lying around for a long time after being cooked we both got sick that night . please avoid the place ! 
this place is exactly what you want from a diner . small town hospitality and cheap , amazing comfort food . . . all with an undeniable brooklyn edge . this was me and my husbands regular spot when we first started dating . you will fall in love too . 
date visited august Nth people myself my tab N went a week ago , and have actually gone N times since . always got the articoke slice , although the crab is tempting . can hardly call it pizza , its more like artichoke dip on top of bread . which is pretty awesome . worth the price , possibly not worth the N minute waits i ' ve heard about . go during the day if you can . scoring system N star won ' t be back . N stars would go back . N stars look forward to going back N stars someplace special . N stars near perfection
in the movie a bronx ' s tale , sonny tells c that in life you get three great loves . well , last saturday i met one of my three , and her name is bianca . bianca is an amazing , small italian restaurant in noho . as corny as this may sound , " where has bianca been all my life ? " i arrived at bianca last saturday with a party of N , most of us first timers . we were a pretty large party and it was a saturday night , so we arrived prepared for quite a long wait as bianca ' s doesn ' t take reservations . we had a couple of drinks at von , the bar next door , as we waited for our table . the host was great . even though we kept moving around to different areas in von , he kept coming by to update us on our table and just chat . after about an hour , our table was ready . upon entering the restaurant , i was surprised by the size of the restaurant - it ' s tiny - and the delicious smells that filled it . the tables are packed pretty closely together . get ready to become friendly with your neighbors . the menu and daily specials all sounded amazing . luckily , we have a good number of eaters in our party , so we ordered quite a variety appetizers fried puffy dough with stracchino cheese mussels with white wine and garlic fried artichokes with crispy parsley chicken liver with aged balsamic vinegar ( N orders ) tomatoes with red onions and anchovies tomatoes with fresh mozzarella main course tagliolini with seafood - frutti do mare gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese special tagliatelle with mushrooms and garlic and olive oil lasagna fennel sausage with cannellini beans dessert romagna style cake with cream cheese tartuffo - chocolate truffle ice cream tiramisu as you can see , we had a feast and it would take a N page essay to explain each dish with the respect it deserves . so , instead of saying everything was great , i will just describe the table favorites . we ordered three orders of the chicken liver . i am not a liver fan , but most of the table was and they loved this dish . my boyfriend said that liver was perfectly cooked and the balsamic based reduction was fantastic . there were fights for the last pieces of bread to wipe the plates clean . my boyfriend was so convinced by this dish that he asked to try the balsamic sauce with the bread , and he was right , i liked it . the gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese was absolutely divine . the cream based sauce was light and rich . the fennel sausage with cannellini beans was bianca ' s way of saying you have not had real italian food until eating here . this is a real local italian dish that was simple yet full of flavor . after nine appetizers , five main courses and three bottles of wine , we were stuffed , but we were determined to have some dessert . we ordered three desserts two were amazing and one disappointing . romagna style cake with cream cheese was a delicious and unusual dessert , unlike anything i ' ve ever had . it was a soft sponge cake with mascarpone cheese . the big winner was the tartuffo - chocolate truffle ice cream . my boyfriend literally licked the plate and said that was a perfect way to end the night . we had a perfect evening thanks to the food and great wine , and the prices at bianca ' s are incredibly reasonable . as i said in the beginning , bianca is my new italian love . 
awesome spot for vegetarians . personable , accommodating staff . fast service and one of the best dosas i ' ve had in the u . s . try it out ! 
first time here and don ' t remember too much but the food was pretty good but expensive . i still have to try the other dishes but we tried most of the best sellers and recommended by the staff . would definitely come back . 
love love love . this cafe is exactly what the walnut street community needed ! great food , amazing coffee , really sweet and attentive staff . in the summer , the outdoor seating area is like a secret garden- an oasis away from the walnut street bustle . 
oh hey , its a ssam bar but you can ' t really get the good ssam unless you preorder with a bunch of people . great . it ' s like an ihop that doesn ' t sell pancakes . and yes , i know they have a fish ssam but everyone knows fish is basically a vegetable . i ' ve been to several of david chang ' s establishments and i have to say i was sorely disappointed by this one . what we ate -- kimchi was good , unique -- i would never have thought to put apples into it . -- rice cake with pork sauce was good , delicious . but its a pretty basic and simple korean dish that ' s really difficult to do poorly . -- pork belly bun was good but really nothing all that special . when you ' re cooking with all that pork fat , it is damn hard to screw it up . a restaurant ( with a reputation like momofuku ' s ) really should do a little more than serve up a slab of pork fat and call it a day . it ' s a little lazy to be honest . -- seafood stew was terrible , awful , very bad , gross . i had a flavor i couldn ' t really put my finger on and i don ' t really care to try to . the only reason i think this restaurant has four stars is because most other non-japanese thai asian restaurants in manhatten are pretty terrible . 
we came here for a friend ' s daughter ' s birthday . i went for brunch . this is a very trendy place so bring your best hipster outfit and a hearty appetite . everyone had da who he ' s and real food but i had breakfast . N ' a simple girl ! the oatmeal was hearty and delicious and the bacon is crispy and tasty . the servers were accommodating for such a trendy place and very sweet . we did not even have to wait N minutes even though the places was crowded to the hilt . the calamari , mac and cheese and fries samples from friends were equally as delian . go for the style and the food . if you are low key then it ' s probably not for you but if you want some nyc trend , and food then head to chelsea ! 
tops for taste and tops for value . well worth the wait ! 
butcher bar is amazing it has the best food and best service in astoria anyone that is visiting nyc or lives there should definetly make it a point to try it ! everything is very fresh and tasty and the vibe is awesome ! ! 
mediocre , expensive , bad service . just a waste of time and money . 
i finally made it to teresa ' s . i went on a sunday night and there was no wait for a table of N . we started with the mixed salad and misto di fagioli e oliva , which is an olive tapenade and white bean plate , with olives . the mixed salad was standard , served with a sweet dressing which was good but which i couldn ' t place , and the olives were out of this world . ( i think i will attempt to recreate the tapenade this week . ) i got the zuccaa pizzette and my date got the linguine vongole . the pizza was great and had a generous portion of mushrooms ( which is why i selected this entree . ) i tried my boyfriend ' s pasta and it was delicious and really had quite a few clams . i will be happily eating leftovers for the next few days . almost ate the pizza cold for breakfast but used my better judgement to save it for lunch , when i ' m awake and can enjoy it . overall i think it ' s slightly pricey but you will also pay N for a burger in princeton , and it ' s a nice environment , so well worth it . 
i will be back here . . . soon . i wasn ' t so sure about african cuisine but my boyfriend and i have a policy that we ' ll try anything once . this is one of those things that we ' re going to be happy to try over and over again . the inside was small , cozy , and warm and everyone that we spoke to , including one of the chefs was a doll . our waiter had about N different special items memorized and when i asked for something that was actually on the lunch menu , they didn ' t give me any problem about making it for me . it was clear that everything on our plates was created fresh and homemade from the fries to the salmon burger , nothing had been previously frozen and everything tasted all the better for it . the seasonings all complimented each other in a unique but fantastic way . if you ' re sick of the same old food and you ' re looking for new spins on dishes that you ' re familiar with , this is the place to go ! they are very reasonably priced too . 
this place is spot-on meh . the ornate decor can be nice , and maybe at night -- we went for lunch -- the ambiance can imbue the food with a little more pizzaz . but as was , not the greatest mexican i ' ve ever had . the chips and salsa the chips were greasy and cold . not even a close comparison to el vez . the flautas were good , but run of the mill . and the tortillas were lacking in the same way pica de gallo ' s are anymore . huevos rancheros , you know , ok . it was so mediocre , we opted not to have dessert . that says a lot considering i learned to spell dessert as " it ' s the one with two ' t ' s because you always want more of it . " 
speedy service . very warm welcome from entire staff . very warm good bye from entire staff . pork buns were delectable . spicy ramen was great . 
the servers are french and are really nice and attentive . the munster tarte had the strong flavorful munster cheese and the kipik had jalape os which gave it spice which he liked . they were both awesome . i really enjoyed . the dessert one we got with apples and the flaming brandy was fun , but i vastly preferred the savory ones we got . their tartes are excellent and have the most amazingly paper-thin crusts . it was delicious . 
decent food . good margaritas . pretty poor service . nice atmosphere . 
in the N ' s i drove down from providence , ri to new haven to sell my N bmw N . i met the guy buying my car at either sally ' s or pepe ' s . it was so long ago , i really can ' t remember which one i had tried , only that the pizza was very good . so when i was in new haven this week , i asked the locals " sally ' s . pepe ' s or modern ? " modern and pepe ' s vied for the top of my totally unscientific survey . since i was with N high school students , i chose pepe ' s because it was walking distance from where we were staying and modern was too far in the cold . luckily it is the " slow " season , so at N N pm we only had to wait for about N minutes to get in . the waiting room is done by the honor system - who ' s next . . . . i ' m not sure that would work as well in brooklyn but it does in new haven so , my take . . . very very good pizza ! definitely up there with grimaldi ' s and the other top nyc pizzeria ' s . i had a small with sausage , onions and peppers ( good by low carb diet that night ! ) . the crust was the perfect combination of crunchy and flavor . the sauce and toppings were exceptional . but the one thing that blew me away was that they have diet white birch beer . . . something i had not tasted in years ! finally our server , charlotte , was very nice and obviously has learned not to be fazed by how busy the place can get ! was pepe ' s the best pizza i have ever eaten ? hard to say , but it is up there ! 
i ' ve been here about three times and definitely plan on going again eventullay . i ' m a creature of habit so i ' m pretty sure i ' ve ordered the same thing each time although i don ' t doubt that other options would also be good . perhaps i ' ll be bold and try something different next time . . . maybe . i usually have the chicken katsu entre and the cream croquette as an app . the chicken is crispy and flavorful- it ' s greasy , which is to be expected of fried chicken , but not insanely greasy so you feel like a slob and the cabbage on the side with the dressing you can choose to douse it with compliments the chicken perfectly . the croquette app is also very delicious- i always want more . their panacotta dessert is also delicious . yes , it is a tight space and there isn ' t much of a sense of privacy but the food is great and the service , at least the few times i ' ve been there , has been decent . i wouldn ' t recommend this place if you ' re looking to have an intimate dinner , which is fine because there are so many options out there that could easily satisfy that need . i have also found it be to a good value for the quality of the food . this is a good little place for what it is it ' s worth the visit . 
meh . . . . waited about N hours for a ramen house . . . okay ppl say its good so i ' ll give it a try not that many seating inside . . cash only----- already a meh to me they only have about N different kind of ramen . . . lame i ' m not sure why these ppl r so into this place . . . maybe bc i ' m asian and i have high expectations for a ramen house overall . . . not worth the wait for a bowl of average ramen to me
pretty good sushi , but not the best in town . they really don ' t do anything special but nothing is bad either . personally , i prefer dai kichi or nouveau sushi . both are better but more expensive . nori isn ' t a bad choice though especially if cost is a consideration . 
i love this place so much i ' ve decided to start writing yelp reviews . i walk a half mile from my place in bed stuy and i am always happy when i get here . the decor is beautiful and comfortable and somehow spacious and intimate at the same time . there is one waiter , middle aged tall friendly guy who is amazing . there is a young girl waitress who is just fine , a little blas , but whatever she ' s still a capable server . the drinks are nice , the brunch is delicious , lots of sandwich salad classic midday dishes . the dinner is my favorite though . things run out quite often but i feel like that is par for the course when you are doing local seasonal . you can ' t really go wrong with any of the dishes . . . the trout , the chicken , the cowboy fries , all of the appetizers . . . all great . my mom loved eating here . my husband loves eating here . my out-of-town friend loved eating here . the place def has a family sort of crowd , but its perfectly romantic for couples and legit for a group of friends as well . it sort of all-emcompasses the neighborhood place that you can always fall back on . 
best pizza in the northeast ! a must try if you ' ve never been . if you don ' t agree then you don ' t know good pizza . 
we must have gone on an " off " night , because it was not a good experience . i ordered the beet salad , and my husband ordered the mussels in a curry sauce . the beets arrived as if they had dumped a whole can on a plate . the presentation was very unappealing . the mussels had the wrong sauce , ( mustard ) , which my spouse hates ! i took two beets , and the small amount of salad that was underneath , and then couldn ' t fathom eating anymore . the waitress took the mussels to be replaced by the correct order . fifteen minutes later , with little attention from the waitress , i decided to cut my losses and leave . we told the hostess that " it was not working " , and that we were taking our unfinished bottle of wine and leaving . the truth was revealed , that the waitress had mixed-up the mussel orders , and the other table had gotten the curry sauce . yet no apologies were ever made , it was if they just wanted the whole mess to disappear . it was our last evening in ny and to say the least , a downer ! 
N . N stars . to venture out away from the usual brunch staples ( eggs , coffee and what not ) , i decided to bring my mom to a specialty restaurant to add some ' spices ' to our weekend . katsu-hama claims itself to be the only authentic japanese katsu restaurant in nyc and i wouldn ' t doubt that . sure , there are other places that serve fried pork chops , but it ' s not in the true japanese style . interestingly , my mom chose the berkshire pork tenderloin set instead of the fried version and she actually regretted it as she overheard her neighbors creating crunching sounds next to her . however , she did enjoy her ' up notch ' pig . the savoriness was definitely there , actually a bit salty for her . there was a lot of sauce on the dish , that ' s also cooked with eggs , so it called for a copious amount of rice to balance out the umami flavor . the pork was sliced thinly and very moist . no chewiness present . the side salad was just shredded cabbage with a few sliced cucumbers and a teasing amount of wakame . i had the tofu salad , which shouldn ' t be called a ' salad ' there it was basically a plate of cubed store bought soft tofu rested on a romaine leaf , decorated with a few tomatoes . wished carrot dressing was available , but would that be an americanized japanese salad dressing that ' s banned from an ' authentic ' japanese restaurant ? i have to applaud for the filtered ventilation . there was no sense of greasiness in the air , as i was apprehensive about in a ' fried ' joint . staff service was decent . needed to ask for tea a couple of times . i would suggest to come during the weekdays for the lunch special ( if you ' re dining in ) because only the dinner menu is offered on the weekend . still not overtly expensive as the oyako don was under N . in the store front , there is an bento area for lunch take out during the weekdays . if you do decide to come , i recommend trying out the katsu , i mean , this is their specialty . 
four words frozen blood orange margaritas el vez is my favorite place to take friends family who are visiting philadelphia because it ' s just so damn good ! you can expect a level of service typical of starr restaurants that i ' ve come to really appreciate . the wait staff is always courteous , attentive , and best of all they know the menu ! of course , per line N , i can ' t say enough about the frozen blood orange margaritas . they ' re massive and totally delish . they make their guac fresh to order so you can ' t not guac itsaguaclife . also , the crispy mahi mahi tacos here are actually to die for - take it from someone who actually hates fish and seafood . when i get cravings , it ' s for those tacos - and don ' t forget to squeeze the lime from your plate into your tacos . . . it makes all of the difference ! 
started going here about N years ago and is always my first choice for polish food in greenpoint . better quality and preparion and less kitschy than king ' s feast or karzma . atmosphere is eclectic and cozy and instills an all-in-the-family feeling . the vegetable soup and blintzes are mind-blowing golumki just like my babcia used to make . since it ' s a smaller place and usually only N-N front-room people performing different jobs , service can get a bit slow if it ' s crowded . 
you get a lot of food for a good price , but their pho is only decent . it ' s a bit bland . i ' ve also had the raw beef with lime which was diviiiine . i haven ' t tried their other dishes , but from looking at my friends ' , they look legit . i like their avocado milkshake , too . seating is a little weird , but i think they do what they can with their small space . we sat at a table for four that was about an inch away from a table for two . the couple looked kind of peeved ( sorry ! ) . the service isn ' t particularly bad , but they could be a little more attentive . overall , pho xe lua is a pretty average place . brownie points for having both a name and nickname that ' s fun to say . 
good food for a good price . solid breakfast , and the same for lunch . the problem is that they are in bella vista , and not far from south street-- and even closer to south philly-- where they are equally incredible places for a good value . dependable , good food , good value . 
do yourself a favor and keep driving . this place doesn ' t listen to a word you say , they never have the type of bagel you want , and the woman at the front is beyond rude . and calling there to speak a manager is impossible considering the unenglish speaking person answering the phone didn ' t understand the word manager . they will never see my hard earned money again . if you ' re the owner and you ' re reading this , do little falls and yourself a favor and pick up your game and try having your staff listen to your customers if you wish to continue living off an income from your bagel store . good day
my friends and i usually enjoy a good take out dinner from mama rosa ' s . their dinner meals are really great portions for anyone . i love italian food and pizza since my childhood . the penne vodka is a very tasty disk with a lot of sauce . just the way i like my pasta to be covered . regarding the pizza , it is not the best pizza in bayonne but they do use fresh ingredients and they have a lot of gourmet pizza to choose from . their garlic bread is full of garlic and olive oil . in my point of view , their is not wrong with things being full of garlic . - ) 
i have eaten here many times , but will never return after my last visit and would recommend others avoid this place too . if you have not had a negative experience here yet , please read through the rest of these reviews for an idea of what you might expect . first , the positives . they make good gourmet pizzas with creative toppings , albeit a little pricey . the waitstaff has always been very friendly and courteous , even when they have no choice but to deliver inhospitable or disrespectful messages from their boss . now let me describe my last visit . it was a hot summer day , close to N degrees outside with high humidity . i brought my family here , a group of N that included my sister who was N months pregnant . there was a wait for indoor seating , but every outdoor table was empty . we sat down at one of the outdoor tables to wait , and were told we had to wait elsewhere . my pregnant sister could not stand for long periods of time , especially on such a hot day , so she stayed seated while we stood nearby . again the owner sent one of his staff out to insist that we moved to a park bench down the street . even after explaining her situation and reminding them that we were waiting for a table at their restaurant , the owner was very insistent that she could not sit there . as a side note , they also would not serve any beverages to our party while we waited , which would have both made them extra money , as well as helped us deal with the heat . we unanimously decided to eat somewhere else a short block away , where there was no wait , and we were treated with respect . my family ' s dignity and safety is worth more than some overpriced pizza . 
the food and service weren ' t bad but not as good as we ' ve had elsewhere in nyc and not as good as i would have expected based on its reputation . it was morning so didn ' t try the legendary cheesecake . the place itself looks great though ! i heard they are moving location as the site is to be developed , so maybe that is having an impact on things . 
these guys make the best buffalo chicken pizza i ' ve ever had . i can ' t even eat buffalo chicken pizza anywhere else anymore because it will inevitably be a disappointment . we get it every time my wife and i come down to visit my in-laws . the tragedy is that my in-laws are moving , so chances are i ' ll never eat at joe ' s again . curse you joe ' s ! you ' ve ruined me for buffalo chicken pizza forever ! 
the best burrito i ' ve ever had . you don ' t get to pick the fillings , this isn ' t chipotle . also , excellent breakfast , vt coffee roasters , and the paninis are real good ( not as much food as a burrito , but similar price ) . the owner is in the kitchen most weekdays and he ' s pretty cool . the hot sauce is ridiculously flavorful ( and not super hot ) . 
i have read some of the current reviews and i would like to give mine . i am also a " somewhat regular " at this restaurant . i also have to mention that i am korean but consider myself korean american since i came to the u . s . when i was N . my family and i have been dining at ichiban for about N years . some comments N ) the waitstaff is very friendly but can at times be very slow . N ) inconsistency with preparation of meals - sometimes a few of the main dishes will come out and then maybe N minutes later the rest of the meals . all meals should be delivered at the same time if they are all ordered at the same time . N ) more korean food than japanese since the owners and cooks are korean . N ) with regard to one of the reviews stating that the korean food is not that good - it is good . take it from a korean . everyone makes their dishes differently . i make kalbi at home and mine is totally different from theirs . N ) the complaints on the bibimbap - are you ordering the stone pot because their stone pot is good . i have brought several friends who are american to this restaurant and all of them rave about the food . they look forward to the next visit . again , i am a somewhat regular and even though there are some inconsistencies i will always go back and will continue to bring new friends to this restaurant . 
great alternative to froo froo uws joints . of course there are long lines as with any brunch spot , but here you can actually get some dishes with a unique taste and texture . millet pancakes that melt in your mouth ( in a good way ) compared to seemingly dry chicken sausage that is better than it looks . labana cheese that is delicious yet somehow closer in consistency to hummus or sour cream . i wish they gave you more pita with it , but the sourdough with fresh jam is a steal and goes just as well alongside the labana . dare i forget my own main course -- poached eggs and salmon over potato pancakes and a little green salad . amazing it ' s only N . i will be back . 
honestly , i went here a second time because someone loved and raved about this place and it was horrendous . the food was incredibly cheesy ( hello , the flavor does not come from cheese alone ) . the prices were high given the type of food given here . and no credit card accepted . wtf . bottomline this place parades as a hip , cantina-style restaurant and because it ' s in princeton , they charge exorbitant prices . drive the extra distance to jose tejas in woodbridge nj . 
i loved this restaurant . it ' s a very nice location ( ask to sit by the window when it ' s nice out ! ) and the food is unique and delicious . i agree with the anna s about the drinks being a bit pricey . however , i will disagree about the portion sizes - they are definitely reasonable for any human being that eats a normal amount of calories in a day ( i . e . not for people that are only " full " after N breadsticks , N towering plates of salad , appetizer and full plate of fettucine alfredo at the olive garden ) . definitely recommend , but more so as a date or friend excursion than a family outing . 
came here with N co-workers , we work nearby . we each had a different pizza- and wow . . . this is not your local greasy bready pizza parlor pizza , this is artisan work done in a real stone terra cotta oven . cant wait to go back , this is the real thing ! 
take your business elsewhere . if you call for a pick up order , they say N min then when you get there after Nmin they will only at that point begin to make your order and say they are busy with only one customer present in the restaurant . they have attitude and over charged us for a pizza that we pay N . N for every week . we have been loyal customers but will now be taking our business elsewhere . when i called and spoke with the " owner " about this matter , he didn ' t care and then the staff very immaturely called me about N times in a row after which they left a message telling me that we were in the wrong and didn ' t want our business . real mature and business like . not ! 
this place should be illegal--it ' s crazy good ! ! ! my absolutely favorite place in nyc fresh seafood--it ' s leaping--great staff , oh how i love you ! ! ! try the oyster clam shrimp appy ! ! ! and the crab legs . . . . and the fried clams . . . and the lobsta roll . . . and . . . . 
was ordered pizza with several toppings , arrived with toppings only on half of it . call to pizzeria , handed phone to delivery guy to confirm faulty pizza pie . rude manager told that pie was good when he packed it , and i have an option to pay full price or stay hungry . i ' m not going to be back there after such experience . 
amazing place to get the best fish you can . i would never go anywhere else ! 
i thought N N pm would be an early dinner . apparently not at jose tejas . people were already waiting for their buzzer to go off , the parking lot was full , and there was a long line of people . wow . and i thought waiting for brunch in manhattan was crazy . jose tejas is crazy ! ! ! it ' s also loud but i supposed that ' s the margaritas talkin ' . large and in charge those margaritas will get you twisted . alcohol not your thing ? soda at jose tejas is served big gulp size . woo wee how i love my coke . an ice cold one tastes like the summertime . such a treat . chips and salsa are complimentary but not as good as chevys . i think next time i will try the chili con queso . i think the thick chips would be good for soaking up the cheese . our meal consisted of two entrees a mixture of beef and chicken fajitas and chicken bandera . i knew it would be plenty . the fajitas came sizzling on cast iron with a whole lot of spices , all the fixins ' , and saut ed onions . the beef was definitely better than the chicken but really it ' s preference . they are both good , tender , and spicy ! the chicken bandera was mesquite grilled and came with this chipotle lime glaze sauce . there was so much sauce we ended up dipping the fries in them ! the fries were great on their own , very crispy , and did not need ketchup or seasoning at all . i loved that they were cut very thin . perhaps my favorite part of this dish besides the chicken and fries was the half grilled avocado with mango salsa . i have never seen that done before a straight avocado grilled and served in its skin . i hear the chimichurri steak is the dish to get at jose tejas . i will be back . i want to try everything . and hey the tex mex cajun thing actually works . the jambalaya is quite jammin ' . now i want some blackened catfish to go along with that . 
Ng great , great , great and great
great great great . good food , not expensive and the staff is great . really cozy decorated place . you just have to try it . the steak i had was perfectly cooked . 
personally , i don ' t see what all the hype is about . voted best pizza in the entire city ? who were the judges . . . the owners of the place ? ? the pizza is fine . not bad , not great . our classic cheese pizza arrived after a long wait , and was kind of sparse and , gasp , pretty dry . i really wanted to embrace my nyer pride and love this place , as its kind of an institution , but after three attempts at eating here and not getting my socks charmed off , i won ' t be back . do yourself a favor and head a few blocks away to lil frankie ' s on first ave for real italian style flatbread pizzas , or pop in to the decidedly unglamorous but amazing rosario ' s on orchard street for a chewy , cheesy ny slice . 
bacon , egg , and hot sauce muffin- oh my ! N and darkly baked and bleeping amazin ' . now sold at the brooklyn flea right up front near the door . rustic , gorgeous and creative loaves , rolls , muffins and cheaply priced for the bleepin ' great quality . 
some friend drag me there for a pizza driven by all this good reviews decor is the typical shabby cliche new york place not italian feeling but it works here . pizza ? ? ? i was quite exited and had great expectations , the place was busy and we wait quite long for our pizza , finally here it comes the crust was thick crispy and chewy not a good sign , the real pizza should be thin , crispy or soft not chewy , it also was quite small in diameter maybe that explain why it was thick ! mozzarella left much to be desired . it was waxy , gummy , test and felt chip mozzarella from curd and not really a milky fior di latte that should go on a " real italian " pizza , quality of that cheese was at the same level of an average pizza by the slice place . i ' m really don ' t understand how this place is rated so hi and had so many reweaves , or maybe i do but i want say it . service was ok in line with a pizzeria trattoria . unfortunately it was not a good experience . 
my sole purpose in coming here was to get my girlfriend ( in town visiting from austin ) a good boozy brunch experience as she ' s never experienced an aycd-type brunch , so this review is strictly about our brunch experience . we started off with the guacamole and chips , which the guacamole was pretty tasty ! slightly bit on a on the tangy side , but still good nonetheless . they serve it in the big stone mortar , so that gave it a nice presentation . there was a bit of a slow start as we were still waiting for one more person in our group to show up . so i suppose i can ' t really fault the service being slow during that time . the boozy brunch is N for an entree and your choice of frozen hibiscus margs , bloody mary ' s , classic margs , mimosas and select beers for N . N hours . drinks we tried -hibiscus margaritas - holy stiffness , these frozen houdinis are strong ! they ' re good , not too sweet but i couldn ' t drink these the entire brunch as they ' re basically frozen slushies . -bloody mary - don ' t do it . they taste really odd , not the savory wholesome bloody mary you would imagine . just don ' t . -classic marg - it is what it ' s called , classic . you can ' t really go wrong these , and they were good here food food was meh , as with any aycd brunch places i ordered the huevos divorciados , which i actually enjoyed . the other girls thought their dishes were just ok . one ordered the breakfast burrito ( chorizo is not the crumbly chorizo you ' re thinking of ) which my friend was disappointed about . the other ordered the chilaquiles rojos with skirt steak . i tried it and it was okay , nothing to write home about . service service was pretty consistent . drinks were replaced pretty quickly and by the end of it , we were all pretty drunk success . atmosphere it was a fun ! lively but loud , and it progressively got louder . i basically felt like i was screaming while talking to my girlfriends at the table . so there ' s your fair warning . i ' d def come back for another boozy brunch here , but the food was just ok . 
come here for the ambience and the drinks . very cool inside , with a deer head over the fireplace , dim lighting , detailed carvings in the wooden furniture , oriental rug , etc . nice selection of beers featuring some from microbreweries . also enjoyed the cocktail menu . bartender was excellent . menu is limited but features the famous grilled cheese from caseus . i am giving N stars because my grilled cheese took N minutes , late at night on a monday when the restaurant was not crowded . . . really ? ? its grilled cheese . they kept forgetting to place my order even after several reminders , so by the time i got mine , everyone had already eaten . regardless , i will be coming back here again . 
delicious and quick service
they all taste the same but in a great way . i think the secret sauce is basically mayo , but again , in a great way . current location -- selling sandwiches out of the front half of lime -- is hilarious . makes me want them to never get permanent digs . 
i live downtown and there aren ' t any vietnamese places in close proximity , so i love this place . the prices are reasonable and whether i order take out , dine in , or grab drinks i ' m always satisfied . must try - the wings ! they have a great sweet and tangy flavor , perfect crunch and are very fresh . they come with a side of creamy avocado dipping sauce . - bahn mi sandwich with pork , although they run out of the pork a lot . something i wish they would work on . - pho soup . i ' m constantly craving pho , and yes i ' ve had much better elsewhere , but the broth is amazing and the portion of beef is substantial . i think they should change the noodles they use , they seem cheap and too thin and get mushy very fast . either way , it still gives me that " drunk on pho " feeling that makes me want to take a nap ! ( which is a good thing ) i look forward to trying more of their entrees next time . the service is always pleasant and attentive . is a nice place to go right after work with a friend or by yourself . 
if you ' re tired of the standard brunches and want to try something you have never tasted before , this pop-up joint will give your mouth an experience equivalent to the first rockin ' party you ' ve ever gone to in nyc . . . it ' s pretty rad . i will be following them wherever they go ! 
my jewish boyfriend and i believed in jesus christ the day we ate lombardi ' s pizza as recommended by the mensch on our tourbus . . . can i even explain to you how it feels to have cheese , that is already melted , coat and caress and slide down the back of your tongue and the crisp yet chewy crust and not-too-overdone sauce cover the roof of your mouth ? a part of me died knowing i was leaving nyc to come back to my papa john ' s in california the next day . 
willing to try
quaint place with a great selection of beer . i ' ve had dinner here once it was filling delicious . the sausage stood out the most i love the hot , fresh pretzel . i ' d say come here if you ' re in the neighborhood but not sure if it ' s worth a trek . 
i will have to agree with some that the service can be very slow at times and i find that the bigger your party , the slower the service . that aside , their food is ah-may-zinnng . i ' ve had their wings , their pizza , and their lobster bisque . ( interesting array of choices i must say . ) there are no free refills which is kind of upsetting since they have a full bar . whatever . they changed the menu a bit . i used to love this pizza called " kevin ' s pie " it had pretty much everything on it and was pretty spicy . i don ' t think they have anything like it anymore but i still enjoy their other choices . i now go for the " garbage " one ( garbage truck ? ) . . . can ' t think of the exact name but it has pretty much all the toppings you can get . ( i am seeing a trend with my choices . . . ) suprisingly i like their pizza a lot even though it ' s not the crispy , cracker thin , crust that i am used to . it ' s not too thick and not to thin , and it doesn ' t fall apart under the weight of the asinine amount of toppings i order . so , in a sense , it ' s perfect . the wings are also delish . nice and spicy . and i was kind of addicted to their lobster bisque . very hearty , perfect for a cold winter day . price wise it is not " cheap " . . . but not overly expensive . i have nothing to say regarding the bar because i have only ever came to sit at a table . i will return and i would ( and i did ) recommend it to friends . 
a truly special restaurant ! with a menu that changes regularly but that is always delicious ! my only complaint is the acoustics . the restaurant can get very loud when crowded , however , the tasty food overshadows the noise . note i highly recommend the lasagna . its delicious . 
zutto has been redone ! great new atmosphere and new menu . delicious sushi and edemame - great wine too - try " fiano di avellino " N from italy . can ' t wait to go back and try more . 
i will say the food is great . the pizza slices can be a lot less greasy and the crust can be a lot thinner . on the other hand , the boss can be very rude , not very welcoming always with a grump face on . not only that but i ' ve over heard him speaking to his employees in a not so respectful way . he talks down to them in a degrading manner . i , myself have witnessed his rude ways by having a conversation with the boss , joe . he gives off such a nasty ora in the restaurant . as well as coming off as an ignorant a hole . excuse my choice of words , but he really makes others feel uncomfortable acting as if he is better than them . owning a buisness , as well as running it , should require a great and welcoming atmosphere whereas customers should want to come back again and again . such a grumpy attitude is no way to run a successful buisness . as a loyal customer , i ' d appriciate a welcoming atmosphere along with a positive and friendly attitude from at least the boss . sorry sir , but it ' s very disturbing to give you buisness and get such negative vibes from a man who runs the place . i hope you learn to give respect to those who help make your restaurant successful . . and you will maybe get the respect from customers and employees . with a great attitude , a great workplace will follow . leave the nastiness and grumpiness at home , it is no way to gain a clientele . but only to lose one . a concerned customer
in the mood for something sweet one night i decided to try this place . i have been back on a number of occasions . i love this place . i have both dined in and taken out and every experience has been a pleasant one . the sweet crepes are a delicious treat when you want a dessert that ' s something a little different . by far my favorite dessert has become their banana and nutella crepe , and it comes with ice cream ! the savory crepes are just as delightful . i have tried a few options off their menu but so far my two favorites have been the crepe du nord and the prosciutto di parma . both have a lot of flavor and are a nice meal that fills you up without being too heavy . 
this was my last stop on my weekend trip eating philly cheese steaks . this was the best on south street . the meat was better and more . plus there was a bottle of hot sauce next to the ketcup . 
i absolutely love the food the crustinis are amazing and the entrees are great . every time i go there the service is good , the wine and food are great and i always can ' t wait to go back . i think everyone should try uva . best , chris
best onion rings ! i went in with a bunch of friends , and we got such good treatment from josh and blair , the owners . the brunch servings were huge , and hearty . and the donuts are divine . definitely going back ! 
we ordered chicken kebab platter , it came with salad , rice , pita humus and N souses . waiting for food takes a bit of time but it worth waiting . the cost of the lunch will surprise you , it ' s only N , N for this much food . everything is very tasty , u can literally just point on something in the menu and won ' t regret you ' r choice . stuff is also really nice and friendly . place is never get ' s crazy busy , so there is no waiting in the line to seat . has a tv to watch some sport . coming back every morning . 
took a chance and stopped-by because of excellent reviews . what an amazing experience ! didn ' t expect the sushi and service quality - absolutely first rate ! several dishes were on the house and the waitress was friendly and courteous . cost was considerably less than expected . will definitely be back . . . 
i truly wish we could give over N stars . we were on a philadelphia cheese steak tour and stopped by here . the line was long , but it was well worth the wait . the server was nice , and the steak itself was a bite of heaven . there was plenty of meat and great bread , the hot peppers were chopped and grilled perfectly , and the atmosphere was wonderful . i came here after reading gq ' s top ten steaks article , and i ' m glad i did . they were right . this place is absolutely amazing . stop by right now . 
N stars fried avocado and jalapeno taco , the margaritas ( go with the N oz . , which is only N more than the N oz . ) N star the tortillas ( an inflexible corn-flour mix ? i couldn ' t figure them out ) , the roasted vegetable taco , and the lack of seating
i really thought the third time would be the charm with this place . . . we went for brunch . if you want to pay N . N for a single pancake , then this is your joint . the menu listed " chocolate chip pancakes " ( emphasis on the " s " ) for N . N . the waiter told us there were at least two pancakes in the order . but we got one pancake and were still charged N . N . when i raised the issue with the waiter , management came out and made some lame excuse about how the meal only includes one pancake that is " larger " than in most places . the pancake was the same size as in any other brunch place . and if you ' re only going to give one pancake , don ' t print up a menu ( and a bill ) that refers to multiple pancakes in the meal . they ultimately took it off of our bill , but acted like they were doing us a favor -- even though we offered to pay the price for a single pancake . there were also little issues like waiting N minutes for coffee despite being some of the only people in the dining room , and having our waiter spill milk all over our table . save your money . frankly , you can get better ( and more ) brunch food for a better price at ihop . 
the frys are great , but the burgers need some more meat . i ' ve never seen burgers so thin . i mean as thin as a peace of deli meat thin . 
years ago this was a N-star restaurant . my gf and i went on a friday night , as we have done multiple times , yet to our dismay we were not seated . keep in mind there were several seats available . we , along with another couple were told that they couldn ' t seat N , as they were saving the available seats for the " possibility " that N patrons could come in and want to eat . so , instead of splitting one of the available tables so both parties of N could eat , they told us we couldn ' t be seated . we asked for a manager and usually this can turn in your favor . in this instance though , it only got worse . we mentioned we had been going here for years and at times a few times per month . . . yet he didn ' t seem to care . he was quite rude to us , which we then congratulated him on losing customers and that we wouldn ' t be coming back or mention it to friends any longer . it ' s amazing how quickly a place can go from being quite good to being out of the dinner rotation due to very poor service . if you ' re going out on a date with your significant other , i ' d recommend you go elsewhere as you won ' t be seated unless you have two more friends to go with you . such a shame ! ! ! ! 
we ordered delivery tonight for our first time trying puerto viejo . we had pollo fongo , churrasco , yucca , sweet plantains and chicharrones de pollo . everything was amazing . everything was flavored perfectly . it really blew away my expectations . delivery was quick and the gentleman was friendly . 
use to go to the one in nutley for over N years , never a bad experience . when i heard it was opening by my house , i was elated . i went there early in N with a few friends bragging about it thinking it was going to be like nutley and it was horrible . cold apps , greasy entrees and cold coffee . wtf ! ? the manager wanted to give us drinks on the house . well we don ' t drink . went back about N months ago and it was amazing ! i couldn ' t believe it . super hot tasty food all the way around . went back last night , never ever again ! the food took forever to come out , were never asked how we were doing , apps were super super greasy , dinner was not tasty at all and of course greasy and i never wanted to run out of a restaurant so bad . we were such loyal customers and i have to say , i was never so disappointed like i was last night . never ever going back again , 
a friend who had an italian boyfriend recommend this place to us and we tried it once and we have been hooked since . this is a traditional italian restaurant , in the middle of newark , nj but dont let that discourage you . they have parking lot so your car will be safe . the food is always fresh and authentic . you may have to wait little but keep in mind that everything is prepared at that moment . you will not be disappointed . have the calamari as a starters , its always amazing . 
maybe my expectations were too high , but i always felt incredibly cramped next to people when i ate here . otherwise the food was relatively good , and the drinks were strong . i just wish we lived back in the neighborhood to make this a regular spot and give it another chance . i ' ll update this review if we come back . 
what a disappointment the americana has become . i used to eat there at least weekly several years ago , and now i seldom the place . i hate going to a place and feeling ripped off when i leave . that didn ' t used to be the case . N for a mediocre burger and a dozen fries in a small cup just doesn ' t cut it . i ' m sure i ' m not the only one . there used to be a wait at the door . . . . haven ' t seen that in a while . 
two words family jewels . the family jewels pizza is one of the better pizzas i ' ve had in my life , fresh with a thin , chewy crust . the hipster atmosphere is fun but not overwhelming or pretentious , and i would definitely repeat order the romaine salad . a lot of people complain that the wait is long , but on a wednesday night at N N , i had no problem getting in and getting a pizza slapped down in front of me in under half an hour . highly recommended 
i stumbled across villalobos and decided to give it a try . awesome tacos , great music and pretty fast service . try the al pastor taco it was awesome . 
i love this place ! ! family friendly , great food and a favorite place of ours ! ! breakfast , lunch or dinner . . . it ' s always great food ! ! ! 
i was dragged here because someone i was with noted that jigga man was spotted here a few weeks ago so it must be good . . i was very pleasantly surprised because it actually was delicious . only reason it gets N instad of N stars is because i had to wait N minutes
my wife and i went here for our wedding anniversary dinner after a ct whale hockey game . the decor is very nice and the food and drinks were very tasty . our server was amy , and she went out of her way to check on us , make us feel welcome , and shoot the breeze with us for a couple minutes at one point . one of the managers , connor , also was really cool too . would definitely go back here in the future ! ) 
do you really need a review about a mobile truck that serves gourmet grilled cheese ? come on . . . the only reason i didn ' t give it N stars was that it takes me N minutes to get to new haven , then another N- N minutes to find the truck . 
let me start off by saying that i am very skeptical of ' mexican ' food in new york city . previous experiences have been so bad that i pretty much swore to myself that i would never get any form of it ever again in my trips back up to new york . this all changed after my experience this week at dos toros . although i swore to myself i would never succumb to that burrito craving ( you know what i ' m talking about ! ) again here in the city , i got off the union square subway train and was starving . about N N pm this place caught my attention with its long line stretching out the door . if there ' s one thing i ' ve learned in my experiences here in ny , it ' s that lines are usually a pretty good thing ! the enthusiastic vibe coupled with the sight of a packed house munching on what looked to be huge , delicious burritos told me that it might be worth it to suck it up and brave the line . i waited for about N minutes and decided to order a mixed carnitas and carne asada burrito . my goal was to try as many meats as i could and figured they would go well together . well let ' s just say that dos toros didn ' t let me down ! ! ! i got everything on my burrito including both hot sauces . the burrito was so well made and not soggy that i didn ' t even need but like N napkin as it kept its integrity throughout the crush ! here were the highlights for me N . carnitas--these are so tasty and have that crisp to them which make you keep coming back for another bite . N . guacamole--this was really solid . creamy and flavorful with little chunks that gave it a nice texture . you really have to get this on the burrito it ' s essential . N . green hot sauce--not really sure what ' s in it but has a great smokey flavor which adds a lot . steak was really good too--well spiced and marinated and it ' s cool they let you get a combo of meats even though it ' s not on the menu . the red hot sauce is indeed spicy but i don ' t think has as much true flavor as the green . however , if you really like spicy , definitely throw it on there ! needless to say , i plan on going to dos toros once more before i leave saturday . 
thank you ofrenda for making my N year anniversary so special . i took my girlfriend to ofrenda for our anniversary . every year i like to try new places and after reading great reviews i picked ofrenda and i was not disappointed ! i don ' t usually write reviews but i ' ve been so impressed with the service that if i don ' t , i ' m afraid no one will believe in great service anymore . to start off , when i made the reservation i made a point to explain the special occasion and asked for a bigger table if possible . when i arrived we had to wait N minutes for a table , but it was all worth it when i sat down and was immediately greeted by the manager on duty , he congratulated us on our anniversary and sent over two glasses of champagne , one with a rose in it . she was so happy , she assumed i was up to it the entire time , so tip of the hat to the manager for making me look good ! on to the dinner plates . i ' m a big guy so the portions were the portions weren ' t the biggest but the flavor made up for the size . i had the chicken with mole , and my girlfriend had the fish tacos and she did not share , which could only mean she loved it and we shared a guac . we drank sangria and margaritas , i had the jalape o , a must try ! when my girlfriend went to the restroom , the manager came over and asked what her favorite desert was , to which i replied tres leches , its really mine but its both of our day right ? ! when she returned we ordered another round of drinks and before she could ask for desert the server approached us with a tres leches decorated beautifully for the occasion . the manager made a point to make me look good and took none of the glory . our server was a delight , not overbearing and although by the end of it he seemed to be running around and made us wait for our check for about N minutes but by then we were so happy with everything we didn ' t mind the ambience . by the time we left the manager was near the exit and very courteously said his thank you ' s and even opened the door for us . maybe next year i don ' t have to look for a new restaurant , and maybe i ' ll make this our anniversary spot ! the only problem is that i ' m not sure my girlfriend wants to wait a whole year to go back ! thank you ofrenda ! 
ended up at whitman bloom when a nearby restaurant had a super long wait . one friend in my party had been here for brunch and had a good experience , so we decided to give it a go for dinner . definitely surpassed my expectations ! w b is a neat hybrid of sports bar high quality restaurant . there ' s a decent amount of bar seating up front with several tvs , and a more cozy dining room in the back . the decor atmosphere has slightly more of a bar vibe imo , which is probably why i wasn ' t expecting much from the food . plenty of specials on a sat night , including N . N oysters ( west coast and east coast ) . loved ' em ! tuna tacos were money . so was the pumpkin gnocchi . scallops , herb crusted cod and salmon dishes were all devoured . prices are avg to slightly above avg . oh and for drinks , try the old fashioned cuppa or honey trap , which isn ' t too sweet . great spot in the neighborhood for a higher quality meal than most nearby options ! 
as many have said before , the food is great but the service is really awful . went for dinner tonight - our Nth time there - the waiter was far more interested in interacting with his coworkers than with us . it was rather early so there was not a lot of competition for attention from the waiter . still i had to holler at him to get refills on wine several times . then we ordered desert and coffee from a young woman who seemed a lot more attentive . but we waited . . . and we waited . . . and we waited . . . after about N minutes during which our waiter never even looked in our direction , she came by and said there was a mix up in the kitchen and the desert we ordered was no longer available . . . at about N N pm . how can you be out of a desert that ' s on the menu at N N pm ? ? ? so we ordered a different desert and she said it would be on the house . the desert was great as was the dinner . after i had to run down the waiter to get the check , we discovered that the desert was not comped but instead one glass of wine was . we were not interested in getting into an argument so we just paid the check with a low ball tip and left . whoever manages this place , if there even is a manager , ought to take a long hard look at the waitstaff and make some decisions . are they there to entertain themselves or to provide a pleasant experience to the paying customers . 
the best
sorry , but i don ' t care if the food is good . . . the setup of this restaurant and service are enough to drive me away for good . cozy seating ? more like elbow to elbow with everyone around you ( so much for romantic ) . they should really re-think the seating arrangement , as not everyone enjoys being packed into the place like sardines . friendly wait staff ? laughable ! they were so rude , and inattentive i seriously thought i was on candid camera . prompt service ? we probably spent a good hour between each course waiting on food ( N minutes to appetizer , N minutes to dinner ) , and then decided to skip dessert because we were tired of sitting there . it ' s cash only . i ' m not sure if they had a sign hanging , but i sure didn ' t see it . that ' s nitpicking on my part , but yet another inconvenience . tip if you come here in the winter , make sure you ' re wearing a very thin shirt . no sweaters or anything as thick , because they keep the heat unbearably high . we stepped outside between our courses just to get some fresh air . in conclusion if you can overlook everything above , then go for it . the food is good and worth a try . personally , i would be embarrassed to subject anyone to the aforementioned problems . stay away ! 
zutto - what has happened to you ? ? ? today i came and the ladies sitting at the table next to me were waiting so long for their ramen to arrive that they had to leave and get back to work ! one of them never got her miso soup while the other one had finished hers . then when i went to order , your very confused waiter who honestly looked like he was high on something , was just an airhead - i asked him what sushi was in the sushi special , and he said " i don ' t know , do you really need me to check though ? " i stared at him and said - of course i do . he did come back though and apologize for his rudeness , but he spoke so softly i could barely here him . at our table , you brought over one soup , but not the salad for my other friend . then the kobe beef and fries came , but not the entrees for everyone else - get your timing right ! then , you left an empty bowl for me so that when my seafood ramen arrived , i could put my shells in there . . . but then one of your waiters came over to ask me if i was done with the bowl - how embarrassing for him when i said - um . . well , no , because my food hasn ' t arrived yet . it seems as though you have overstaffed your restaurant , your leading hostess who was always in charge is not there - and it is just plain mess . you are going to lose all your lunch customers who are watching the clock to get back to work if you don ' t get back into shape ! ! 
a friend of mine brought me here for dinner after a class last month and the meal was really yummy ! ! i found the service to be attentive and thorough and , although small , i really liked the ambiance . i enjoyed it so much that i ended up having a party there for N people utilizing the hour glass ' s lovely Nrd floor space ! i love the music instruments on the wall on the Nrd floor and the whole ambiance was intimate and fun ! the food was fantastic and very well orchestrated so that there was always a wave of something new arriving for the buffet at reasonable intervals . and did i mention the food was absolutely yummy ? ? o ) we had a pretty diverse menu and i found the owners very accommodating to help cover all the dietary needs of all our guests . the young girl who bartended for us was absolutely charming and helped make the atmostphere all that more fun ! the second floor bar was also available for those of us who wanted to continue chatting after our time upstairs was complete . we had the room for N hours and i think the price was really , really reasonable for the space , the amount of food and the great service ! give it a shot , you ' ll be happy you did ! i just wish they had more space downstairs on the first floor , but then again , that would take away some of what makes this place so cute ! 
i can only speak to the donuts and coffee . they are so unbelievably good treats . real , made fresh . i would always say no thank you to the usual donuts . these are a big yes ! 
i could give you many , many anecdotes that would illuminate how bad this place is , but i ' ll just talk about the last time i was there . i walked in saturday night and was told that i couldn ' t order because " our printer is down . " when i asked if they ' d ever heard of pencil and paper , the girl at the counter gave me a blank look . food that varies from sublime to ridiculously bad . that ' s the only " positive " thing i have to say about this location . service ranges from indifferent to bad to surly to monumentally incompetent . i really rooted for this place , but it ' s so horrible that i wish it would just go out of business and let an actual restaurant come in and take its place . my only regret is that i can ' t give this place zero stars . 
i absolutely love coming here . my favorite go to is the chicken quesdillas . the sweet plantains incorporated adds the right touch . their drinks are also pretty good and they have great happy hour specials . 
my experience at amada was a mixture of good and bad . we arrived a little early for our reservation so we grabbed a drink at the bar , but i was thrown off by the hostess - she seemed really pissed off and annoyed , not at all warm friendly . the bartender was cool - we told him we were from nyc and visiting philly for the weekend and he gave us some cool spots in chinatown to check out , but when the hostess came by to seat us , she seemed impatient as we tried to get the names of the places from the bartender again , and he told us , " i ' ll write it down for you , don ' t worry . " so we went on to our table and meal , fully expecting to get a list of places we had talked about . wrong ! the bartender must have forgot or something , and as we left , the other bartender told us he had left for the night - fail . i was also a little surprised that a restaurant of this stature and size didn ' t have a coat room - come prepared to lug your coat around with you - not cool . i will say , the tinto sangria was heavenly - the cinnamon really goes well with the sweetness of the sangria . aside from the rude sub par service , we enjoyed the ambiance and most of the tasting menu ( N per person ) . the charcuterie and manchego with truffle lavender honey was to die for ( and the honey is on sale for N a jar on your way out ) ! ! but the artichoke empanadas were just gross . it tasted like pizza toppings thrown in some cardboard . awful . one of the dishes was lamb chops - they were cooked well , but didn ' t seem to have much going on aside from the actual lamb chop . no side , no sauce , no spices , nothing . that was a little weird - we wondered if it was delivered to our table without prepping it ? anyway , the other dish that threw me off was some kind of white fish and N measly little clams . again , it was just cooked and put on a plate - nothing special , no sauce or spices , just what tasted like cod and a few steamed clams . meh . the other stuff was pretty good though , overall i wouldn ' t complain about the food , but the service left a bit to be desired for the hefty price tag . that ' s the thing with trendy popular places - is it really worth all the pretentiousness and rudeness for a decent dinner ? while it ' s not terrible , i probably wouldn ' t recommend this place - we like amis on Nth st much much better . 
the chorizo and potato soft tacos weren ' t anything to write home about . and don ' t order a burger you wont get it for at least a half hour . 
this place lives up to the hype . the food is great and the place runs like a well-oiled machine . i live really close by , so i ' ve tried just about everything on the menu at this point . burgers , hotdogs , fries , corndogs , shakes and concretes are all amazing . worth checking out if you ' re in the mood for some fast food ! 
one of my favorites in philly . the setting , service , and food are all top notch . never had an ok experience . i ' d come here for the bread alone . if possible get an outside table . 
i don ' t live in west hartford , but i do work in the area ( have been for a couple years now ) and spent many lunch breaks looking for that perfect place that offers good food and fast ( without being fast food ) and one place that never disappoints is harrys bishops corner ! ! my day may drag a little more when i know that ' s where i ' m headed for lunch , but the anticipation is worth it ! they have a number of incredible slices available if you ' re looking for a quick " in and out " , or if you ' re lucky enough to have time to sit and eat they have an even more incredible menu to choose from . i ' ve heard a lot about their " tb " ( tomato basil pie ) , and i finally got the chance recently to try it , and let me tell you . . . one of , if not the best slice of pizza i have ever had ! looking forward to the day i have the time to dine-in without having to rush back to work ! ! ! ! ! 
everyone seems to be clamoring for everything in downtown jersey city . as a person who was around before the revitalization of downtown , i ' m all for things that give me a little bit of the charm of the old jersey city . this place definitely gives that vibe . you go in , you see all locals . how do i know they ' re locals ? trust me , i know the difference . and i can see why they go here . the food is awesome , and all homemade . we had the clams casino , stuffed mushrooms , manicotti , and ravioli special . all were homemade and absolutely delicious ! and they serve you fresh italian cookies at the end of your meal ! i always used to pass this place but never go in . now , i ' ll be sure to go in a lot more instead of just passing by . 
delicious food in a convivial atmosphere . the arepas are terrific , and there are enough vegetarian options to keep it interesting . choose a few different arepas and share with your tablemates ! i just wish they were planning to stay byob forever . five stars as long as they ' re byob , four stars thereafter . 
sooo delicious ! ate at Nam best pizza ever ! best place for late night snack if your in the area . i love ny pizza ! ! ! great artichoke pizza and crab pizza ! ! ! i love margarita ! ! ! 
the service at this place was terrible . i read great reviews about this place and decided to try it out . i went with a few girlfriends . the food was good . it seem very athentic and had a lot of choices ! over ten pages in the menu . the restaurant ambiance was great too and it seemed like a happening place to be . however , the service was awful ! ! ! we had to call someone over to get our order after ten minutes of sitting there with no service and we had to ask for utensils . the wait staff would just throw our stuff down on the table and walk away . no one checked to see how anything was and when we did ask for something , like water , they made it seem like we were bothering them . the second time we asked for water refill they rudely plopped a water pitcher down at our table . this was suppose to be a fun and free night this experience was just awful . we will never return to this restaurant . hopefully they were just having an off night . 
love the beer ! but the menu is just ok . there fries are unsatifying . i ' ve a couple good burgers but the portabella sandwhich is a waste and the ' in the grass ' option is kind of ridiculous in how it is served . fried green beans are a must order . 
i really enjoyed this place but i was skeptical of the mixed reviews . my family and i went anyways and were pleasantly surprised . to begin with it ' s a rather cozy establishment with some very interesting things to look at along their walls . it is a bit dark and the table we were assigned had no leg room under it ( for some reason ? ) the service was stellar and we were taken care of by two waitresses , both very responsive and quick . our food took quite a while to make it to the table although it was worth the wait . we all ended up trying one another ' s plates to compare , it was a fun experience , and the meals are delish . 
good italian cuisine no complaints . the selection was pretty standard fare , nothing new . however , the cuisine was good , fresh , no grievances here , check it out with a date or a pal or the famiglia ! 
i ' ve only been here for drinks , but the service is incredibly friendly and the setting is beautiful - a great place to spend a friday night with friends , especially those from out of town . catfish is on relatively quiet street area , so it feels tucked away and intimate . my husband goes at least once a week for the shrimp and grits . 
best falafel ! i never knew about this place . 
sampan is a great place , period . if you are alone , or out with just one other person , i highly recommend their fantastic happy hour . it is reasonably priced and includes a wide variety of drinks and small bites ( and in a place where portions are made for sharing this is important when you are alone or with only one other person ) , ranging from N- N . some of my favorites are the edamame dumplings , the brussel sprouts and broccoli , and really all of their satays . truly delicious . i also recommend sampan for large groups , as the environment is beautiful , the family style feel is relaxed ( think tapas meet hot pots ) , and it is truly a place where you can spend hours ( though the bill can rack up too , so be careful ) . 
excellent service amazing food nice drinks . . . . a little bit overpriced wines but deffinetly it deserves them . . . deffinetly we ll be back
i live next door , so i see it all . hearth is as close to a grand-slam as you could reasonably expect to find amazingly human friendly helpful service , fantastic wines ( try their wine bar three doors down , terroir ) , and homemade italian food that makes your toes curl . chef marco ' s wintery comfort food , ribolita , is sometimes all i crave for weeks on end a hearty bread-and-bean soup stew thing that ' s beyond amazing . one criticism , to prove i ' m not being paid to glow the busboys get really bitchy sometimes , and i ' ve noticed the serving staff fighting with them numerous times just to get someone ' s table ( once it was mine ) cleared off quickly enough . dirty plates become unappetizing quickly , so smarten up , you awesome people ! 
may N , N mr . julian gaxholli blue restaurant N richmond terrace new york , ny N dear julian i am writing to thank you for a wonderful dining experience at your restaurant on saturday , may Nth for my mother ' s birthday . from the minute we arrived at the front door , we were assisted by a young man who helped us with my dad ' s wheelchair as we entered the restaurant . those who were in the bar area greeted us pleasantly and lee made it a point to help us to our table . we were so pleased to note that our table was ready for us with a place for my dad ' s wheelchair and we were seated comfortably at a great table right next to the window . it was especially nice of you to come to our table and introduce yourself to us . it was a pleasure to finally meet you . your graciousness and hospitality was genuine and your attempts to make us feel welcome were greatly appreciated . needless to say , the service and the meal itself were excellent . we all enjoyed your culinary talents immensely . your soft shell crab was the best my mother and i have ever tasted - and both she and i are great fans of soft shell crab . from beginning to end , the meal was outstanding . last , but not least , i would also like to thank you for treating both my parents to dinner . it was very unexpected and generous of you to make that gesture . all in all you and your entire staff made the evening a great success . i would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for allowing my agency to print the menus of all three of your restaurants in braille . your attempts to make your restaurants accessible to those with disabilities are very much appreciated by me and the disabled community . thank you again , julian . please be assured that i will be recommending blue to everyone i know . sincerely , lorraine de santis , executive director staten island center for independent living
so this is where the inspiration for family style chains like maggiano ' s little italy comes from ? the service was friendly and attentive but damn those portions are huge . don ' t come here with less than a large family or you ' ll be taking home leftovers . the fried zucchini is a large haystack of fries , and the pasta is pretty average and nothing special . i think you can boil your own pasta and get your own sauce and it would be the same thing . overall i prefer tony di napoli in the times square area . 
from the first time you walk in your on vacation . it is the best the food is fun and always something new to try , john is the man of the house you are always welcome . good times . . . . . . . . . . . . . . yes
my friend and i accidentally walked into hearth while looking for terrior . we sat down at the bar and took a look at the enormous libations list and were quite impressed . the wines are quite pricey ( cheapest glass of wine is N . . average was probably between N- N ) but are obviously amazing wines . there were two people sitting next to us at the bar and they seemed as if they were doing a wine pairing with their food - everything looked fantastic and i really wanted to reach over with a fork and try some of their food . the drink menu was cute - a thick binder but with little bouts of humor sprinkled throughout the book . . i don ' t want to give it away , so you will only find out if you go there and check it out ! the ambiance is great for a date here and i will be back ( with a man of course ) hopefully in the not so distant future . 
simple perfection , made with love , great service . . . . had brunch , came back later to eat again . always a nice crowd , people laughing , having a great time . sit at the bar if chris is bartending , teresa is also a great server . . . just good people with great hearts , an eye for detail , and amazing charisma . all around an excellent experience . try the dutch baby pancakes . . . . the burger . . . and work through the drink menu . . . all of it . 
best dumplings in the city . the pork is very clean tasting and not off putting like other dumpling places . it is a bit over taken with hipsters but that is a sign of quality if anything . 
it is the first time i ' ve been to zento since they moved location . the last time was several years ago ( maybe N or more ) and i splurged on an omakase for myself , i would have rated it at least a N . N then . unlike my original visit however , i was now armed with restaurant . com gift certificates and decided to make some choice selections off their menu . namely , the volcano roll , square tuna sushi , peking duck hand roll , chilean sea bass main and banana spring roll dessert . total cost N before tax , tip and discount . this was an early N Npm reservation on a wednesday night , so there was almost no one present at the time , making for a very quiet meal . some of the first things i noticed was the substantially upgraded decor , replacement of the sushi bar with a real bar and the addition of tvs . at the time , ' enter the dragon ' was running but unfortunately without sound or subtitles . the meal itself was great but not fantastic . the sushi presentation was top notch and the flavors satisfying . the volcano roll had the right amounts of rice and duck meat , the perfectly cooked sea bass and its accompanying salad were delicious as was the volcano roll and square sushi . i did have problems with a few things . the square sushi was very difficult to handle and made me believe these were built with style over function since it kept falling apart or it ' s layers separating when picked up . the sea bass main , although delicious lacked any presentation flair given to the sushi . and the banana spring roll ( banana fritters ) was just that and nothing more . there was also the issue with my being not full . . . i prepared to order their N omakase until i asked what it contained . the answer was a mix of sushi , sashimi and special rolls enough to feed N or N people . so it wasn ' t a tasting menu after all . oh well . i departed feeling torn between an expectation that based on what i paid , i should be bloated but also pleased that i could walk home with ease . zento is a good restaurant for food , but it didn ' t give me a compelling reason to go back , not alone anyway . but i will return since i have so many gift certificates , maybe for drinks ! kristina is a fantastic host by the way , and the rest of the staff are very helpful and friendly . edit why does singapore ' s zento seem so much more impressive ? any chance it can be applied in philly ? 
it was worth the N min wait ! just fab food and their fish tank was the most beautiful we ' ve ever seen . we miss new york so much and will eat here for sure when we come back this fall . it may be out first food stop ! 
i ' m pretty impressed by the food here . being a vegan in new orleans pretty much sucks , save for french fry po-boys . at the khyber we got the vegan buttered popcorn , vegan gumbo , vegan pulled pork sandwich , vegan fried chicken po-boy , sweet potato fries , and collard greens . everything was really great except for the pulled pork sandwich , which was just good , i ' d say--a little too vinegar-y . great atmosphere , great food , great beer selection . definitely go ! a serious gem in the heart of slimy old city . 
hangover heaven . i was so blah one day and wanted disgusting messy halal food in my mouth . this place did the trick . the line is sooooo huge all the time , the meat is tender and i didn ' t have to reject any of the chicken . i would come here every day but i think i ' d become a fat ass . this is the best street meat ever . these guys should get a prize . 
terrible reservation and waiting system . we ended up leaving after waiting for nearly an hour after being told the wait was going to be N minutes . asked the host how much longer the wait was going to be and was told that there were reservations for N pm ( it was N N ) and we would have to wait for them to be seated and those tables to finish their meals . i had also noticed many people with reservations actually ended up waiting for about N-N minutes before being seated . based on there seating system , i would not return to this establishment . i am sure the food is pretty good but i will not be the one to find out . 
i ' m writing this review after about N or so visits to pok pok ( i live in the neighborhood ) . the first several times i was floored by the flavors and how interesting and authentic the dishes were . and the atmosphere was fun , service good . waiting never an issue , as i would put in my name and then wait at my place for a call . the last few times i have come to rethink my affection for this place , especially when i get the check . the restaurant is starting to seem more and more like a processing plant . you get shepherded to the most ridiculously undersized , cramped tables , elbow-to-elbow with annoying hipsters wearing tank tops so their underarm hair is in your face while you eat . the expeditors ( hosts ? ) wear doofy little headsets like they ' re coordinating the moon landing or something . at first the service is really good , but then you realize it ' s because they want you to order , eat , and get the hell out so they can fill the table again . i get it , you ' re a business trying to generate revenue , but when i ' m paying N for dinner i don ' t want to feel like i ' m at some deli or fast food place . the last time i went on a saturday at N , which was a huge mistake because like nyc cabs , these guys do a shift change , and the service vanishes . and really do the prices really need to be so sky-high for everything ? you can ' t even get a draft beer for less than N , which for this neighborhood is too high . if the service improved and the prices were reduced ( ha , yeah right ) , this would be an easy N stars . 
fare is a refreshing dining experience set on fairmount near the art museum . the service was impeccable and the menu was loaded with interesting options like the clam and bacon topped flatbread , tuna tartare and zucchini chips dusted with powdered vinegar . if you want to try something special , you need to check out this friendly neighborhood spot . 
i went to this store and i had a tuna wrap with small fries for N . N and a free fountain drink . i also had european ketchup . the fries were nice and thick it was crispy on the outer core and smooth on the inner core . the wrap bread was so special and they put great organic greens with tomatoes and tuna with celery . it was very tasty and whenever i ' m in old city i ' d have to remember to go to this store to , european republic
such a wonderful dining experience ! the service was so very attentive and polite . i was not wowed by the bread , but everything else made up for it . we ordered the duck terrine onion and pistachio marmalade . very tasty ! i would have this again . for the entrees , we each ordered different plates so i got to try several . sea scallops baby beets and bacon - sooo good . the scallops had this delicious grilled taste , and the beets had a little yogurt . yum ! stuffed meatball parsnip puree , onions and red wine - this was good , the meat was tasty , but i would try something new before ordering this again . smoked kielbasa , fingerling potatoes , sauerkraut and grain mustard - this dish wasn ' t as good as i expected it to be . the sausage was memorable , if a bit lean . it was good , just not wow good . chicken , butternut squash , carrots and crosnes - this was surprisingly good . i thought it would be boring . i don ' t know what spices they used , but it was delicious ! i ' d definitely have this again . so if i had to rank them , i ' d say N . chicken N . scallops N . kielbasa and N . meatball . in general , they were all delicious and satisfying ) for dessert , we had their ginger , cinnamon sour cream and milk chocolate coconut ice creams . they were paired with some little cookies . the milk chocolate coconut was my favorite . i ' d order this again ! thank you gramercy tavern for being a restaurant that really cares ) we appreciate your down-to-earth treatment and look forward to returning again and again ! 
i ' ve been to underdogs a few times and the most recent was after a year hiatus . have things gone downhill at this joint , or is it just me ? ! first , one improvement - they now take cards ! for someone who relies on her debit card for all purchases , this is major . i ordered a few dogs to go and was super excited to bite into my manhattan-style dog , but was semi-disappointed when i did . it was flavorless and didn ' t remind me of the manhattan i used to get at underdogs a few years ago . maybe i just got a bad dog though . 
crazy anal chick waiter with braids and sweater needs to take a fuckin chill pill . was yelling at us all night when we just dropped over three grand at their joint in one night . would have been a pleasant experience without the ' tude . 
after searching high and low for something inexpensive to serve at my bday party , came across lao bei fang ' s reviews and read them carefully . convinced by the majority of the reviewers ' comments who were of chinese heritage or who had traveled to china , this place won . so , i called to place an order for N x N dumplings . ( uh . . math anyone ? ) they take only cash , so they couldn ' t place a credit card deposit , and i was on my bicycle all day . so i bicycled all the way from downtown brooklyn to elmhurst . a N mile ride . needless to say , when i got there , i was hungry . i placed an order for N fried pork and leek dumplings , N pork and cabbage steamed , N steamed veggie , N veggie buns , and N scallion and meat pancakes . and a bowl of hand-pulled noodle soup with beef to eat right there . the price , a bit more than the other N-N star rated places , reflected the better quality . it still was less than N to feed N people including my soup . lucy handled my order ( see seemed like the manager or the owner ) . she was all about business , took care of my appetite , and treated me like a vip . the soup rocked . and i don ' t usually like chinese food . the next day , i drove a zipcar to pick up my order and lucy had N guys help load the car , parked in front of a fire hydrant right outside the door . i wanted to tip them , but the one guy refused . about N people enjoyed the food at a local watering hole ( N jay street bar in brooklyn ) . i ate a scallion-meat pancake and some dumplings . the meat in the pancake was a little too sweet for my taste , but still yummy . other people who ate the pancakes loved them . the fried pork and leek dumplings went first . definitely the crowd ' s favorite . afraid there would be leftovers , i had brought some small take out containers to the bar . unnecessary . everyone asked where the food came from . unfortunately , i had to keep looking the name up , but it ' s worth remembering lao bei fang . i think i ' ll type it one more time for memory lao bei fang . worth the N mile bike ride and the return car trip . 
had an early dinner here before the movies . i thought the food was really good , especially for a neighborhood severely lacking in anything other than bad pizza . the backyard is really pretty and the servers were friendly . the pork puns were the shining star , obviously , but the drunken noodles and short rib curry were also delicious and while a bit on the pricey side for the small portions , the quality of the ingredients was certainly noticeable and worth the cost . the only inexcusable part was that they charge N for a N ounce bottle of tsingtao - that is insane , guys . 
in response to kristine s . , who simply cant believe that me , being an individual with my own opinions , can actually like something that she apparently does not , let me simply state a few things . i ' m sorry to disappoint you , but i have no affiliation with green eggs other than the fact that ive been there about N times already because i think the food is delicious , the servers are extremely friendly , and the one owner ive spoken with on occasion is extremely congenial every time i arrive . i assume that readers of the review i posted will see a genuine appreciation for the business , including their affordable prices , clean , bright interior , and eco-consciousness that i havent found in the same levels at many other places in the city . its always easier to criticize something from afar why not talk to a manager and tell him of the problems you had , instead of getting upset at someone you dont even know who had a different experience ? 
excellent service . . . way to go tramell jason ! we enjoyed two delicious pizzas and a couple hard ciders before walking the brooklyn bridge . definitely a must stop for the perfect coal fired pizza . my advice . . . . . go ahead and get the large pizza or you ' ll wish you had ! -tc gb
the billy burger was good , but a bit small . the sweet potato fries were what you would expect . they tasted like frozen sweet potato fries that were cooked . the service was mediocre . it was good to try , but not worth going back . 
great beer selection . the house brew is amazing . had the mussels they were great and cheap N for Nlb
delicious , though always crowded . easy to order and pay ( all with touch screens ) . love this place , it ' s my top place to grab lunch ! 
you gotta love peruvian chicken ! mmmmmm . no wait , crowded place where all the tables are really close to one another . i split a whole chicken and yuca frites with my boo . loved the yuca frites , as usual ! you also have the green sauce to add onto the flavor . for this dinner that left us stuffed , the total bill only came out to N . not bad ! afterwards before , you can shop around the little town center with michael ' s , sephora , whole foods , etc . 
got the lunch special tomato tofu with veg fried rice . it was tasty ! the down-side is it was N rice and N tofu dish . since it was only N . N , i guess i ' m fine with that breakdown of rice tofu . but i thought i should mention it since it is chinatown and comparable places will give me alot more of the dish and much less of the rice . . . credit card min of N . 
the only thing better than the prosciutto pizza is the cute brunette waitress . nicest staff we ' ve had in a while
great when you ' re in a jam , like at Nam . don ' t expect much except decent service and mexican soul food . don ' t hold back , order greasy . 
the best experience i had my whole vacation . everyone from the hostess , bartender , manager , to the waiter was simply a dream . they were just amazing . the food was breathtaking , as was the service . i will tell everyone i know to make sure to visit when they are in town . 
burger extraordinary ( juicy ) . fries weird hard to eat . N hour wait at Npm , called our cell . didn ' t need to show our party . 
my fiance and i are looking for a venue for our wedding and came across this place . it was beautiful but when they told us about the pricing it was great deal for us but as he showed us the rooms , they were cramped and small . its an old place but they should make the rooms bigger for larger parties . 
this place is incredible . . forget about the wait because all good things come to those who wait . . . plus i live around the corner , so i put my name down and come back in a half hour--- if not , i enjoy some sake at their over packed bar but this is new york . the pork and chicken buns are incredible the ramen is delicious , samari rib amazing . . . love the atmosphere ! 
i was wandering new york a little while ago trying to find a restaurant that turns out had closed in the past year or so . bummed by this discovery i started to wander the streets in search of food . i ended up yelp-ing this place , and they had a check in deal of a fresh sake with the meal . the food was great . the desert was delicious , although red bean pastries are something that may have to grow on you if you ' ve never had them before . overall i recommend the place . i won ' t go any deeper because it was a while ago , and i would rather keep mum rather than misinform . cheers . 
new yorkers are so lucky to have dumpling house . it reminds me of the best of a street food stall - hole in the wall , super cheap , and extremely tasty . you can walk up to the front window and place your order or go inside and find a seat among the boxes . it ' s a tight squeeze . this place is very small . my husband agrees with other people about not liking how thick the dumpling skins are , but i think there are different styles of dumplings . the skins are thinner down south but i ' m guessing this place specializes in northern cuisine ( the sesame pancake is an indication of this - i ' ve seen it at chinese islamic restaurants ) . the pancakes are amazing and so are the sandwiches they make with wedges of pancake . . . the best part is the hot , fresh soy milk ! ! ! ! 
best japanese food i ' ve had in brooklyn . we love it so much we ' re there once or twice a week . recommendations -their sashimi are very fresh they sometimes have a scallop special topped with uni ! must try . also try their rolls or taco style sushi . - i would also recommend the garlic fried chicken and of course the pork belly udon . very friendly staff and cosy place . enjoy ! 
amazing food ! the gnocchi lasagna was really tasty - i ' ll definitely be getting that again . i also tried a quattro formaggi flatbread which was delicious . the owner matt took some time to explain the menu and its offerings . very nice guy , and from what i ' ve tasted so far he ' s got a hit on his hands . i can ' t wait to try some of the build-your-own pasta combinations . highly recommended ! 
place is always packed but food is great and place is very inexpensive . worth the wait . 
we were in town for the uvm graduation . guild came with high reviews . the lower dining section was somewhat charming . the upper section , where we were seated , lacked ambience . the waitstaff was top notch . the appetizers were very good . however , the dinner was the big problem . the steaks ran N for N oz filet , N for a N oz sirloin . very expensive in my book . there were N in my part . the mahi mahi was undercooked and " strange " in texture and taste and was sent back . we had N salmon dinners very undercooked and sent back . they appeared to have taken the fish off the plate and quick cooked it and put it back on the same plate . the accompaniments were now cold . i never mind spending money on a good dinner . guild just missed the mark on too many grades . 
wow , impressed . loved rubirosa ! would def come back even though there is a bit of a wait . def try to make a reservation . our waitress was a complete doll , so nice and helpful . here ' s what we got arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette -we both agreed this salad was delicious ! the serving size was healthy and it was so delicious . i happen to specifically like lemon flavored food stuff , but my friend i was with is pretty impartial and she loved it too . yum . chicken parmigiano - this was so good . i ' ve never ordered chicken parm at a restaurant before but as recommended by our friend who loves chicken parm , this is the best . so so so good and humongous . def big enough for N-N people to share ( or expect leftovers ! ) loved rubirosa , can ' t wait to go back . ) 
great deal for the money . . or any amount of money for that matter -- it ' s delicious ! ! the blueberry donuts and chocolate glazed donuts are unmatched . haven ' t tried the rest , but i ' m sure it ' s no different . 
i ' ve been to this wonderful little italy restaurant several times and it is consistently good every time . don ' t come here if you ' re looking for italian-american spaghetti and meatballs , chicken parm etc . this is italian cuisine and they do it well . i had veal with artichokes and mushrooms in a wine sauce . deliciously tender and moist with good flavor . the service is very attentive without being annoying . can ' t wait to go back ! 
if you work in midtown and are screwed for lunch options , try their hot buffet . the bbq is amazing . 
i ' m not a huge tapas fan , but i came here with friends last week and was pleasantly suprised . the food was good , the service was friendly and prices were very reasonable . i will be back . 
john ' s roast pork tommy dinic ' s are the two reasons why i refuse to eat roast pork and cheesesteaks anywhere else but in philadelphia . i would classify john ' s roast pork as a hole in the wall . a glorious hole in the wall . a grade a hole . a wall of gold . sure , nothing about it is pretty . but the lines don ' t lie . especially if those lines are filled with predominantly locals . i ordered the bacon cheesesteak i figured why not marry two of the greatest things in life . the result was better than additive it was synergistic , a word rarely applied to cheesesteaks . easily the best cheesesteak i ' ve had . ever . period . ( you know it ' s the real deal when us yelpers write . like . this . ) until proven otherwise , i plan on stopping here every time i pass through philadelphia . i will , however , avoid the temptation of wearing my mariano rivera jersey while doing so . 
best burrito join in east village . 
cheap and great dumplings ! N for a buck ! a pint of fresh soy bean milk for N . please note this is a hole in the wall place in nyc . please don ' t complain about the surrounding as not clean and potential rodent problems in the area . . . after all it ' s nyc . the place got rated an a by the health department and the folks at prosperity know what they ' re doing . 
after several failed attempts , finally , my first batali experience and i gotta say , i came away with mixed feelings . some dishes blew my mind away , others were like , how much did i just pay for that ? ? so the best dishes were by far the appetizers , definitely get the spread of deli meats ! it was the best dish i had there , reminded me of being in the market in florence all over again . the brussel sprouts were also out of this world , yes i know that sounds weird , especially for a non-vegetable eater like me . for the main dishes we got the veal with prosciutto on top and the gnocchi , and i didn ' t think either were really memorable , though my date loved the veal . dessert was a hit as well with the tartufo and panna cotta . so to sum up , i ' d put the appetizers we had at N , the main dishes at N , and the dessert at N . now considering the price tag after the N bottle of wine was just over N , i ' d say it was a steal for a batali restaurant ( except for the wine ) . 
olivier , the owner of this establishment is a friend of the family so recently while visiting my brother in nj we wanted to show our support and drove the hour ( without traffic ) to have dinner at olivier bistro . i am a culinary trained cook with a huge passion for well prepared , fresh and delicious cuisine . ok , i know what you are thinking , we ' re friends . . . i would not write a review if in any way this fell short of our expectations and can easily say we would be regulars if we didn ' t live N hours away . absolutely loved the authentic casual french bistro experience from the warm ambience , the friendly , attentive service to the well thought out and perfectly executed menu . . . loved everything ! you must go ! ! ! 
lots of stars among us ! ok so for atmopshere definitely a N star . i love the look of it inside . i like that you can bring kids there and they blend right in to the noise ! ! for food , N stars . i personally think for a chain seafood it is better the rl . my " beef " is that if your a crab lovers , like our family is , there really isn ' t an option that offers alot of crabs . how about an all you can eat promo ? or a dish that has a large buckets of crabs , maybe a couple of lbs ? our apps were good , had several . was disappointed that they didn ' t have a coconut shrimp app but we went ahead and just ordered a coconut shrimp meal for all to share . our main dishes were good . for service , well all around us had these bibs on and i was so excited to have a bid , maybe just to be comical but we were the only table without bibs . we had to ask for refills on our drinks . . . a definite no no ! ! well that ' s my experience and i am sticking to it ! 
me and my wife went to the malaysian cuisine a few times and i really love the coconut curry rice . also don ' t forget to try the iced coffee as well ! this is our new spot we will be back . 
after reading the reviews for grammercy tavern i see there is nothing left to say . this is our third time to gt and amazing doesn ' t even describe the experience . they define the true meaning of hospitality . i can ' t wait to go again . 
i ' ve walked by this place quite a few times since it opened and finally made it in here on saturday . very cool vibe and feel to the place . they have an extensive beer list with a diverse selection . service was friendly and very attentive . our party of N got the burger , the asian pulled pork sandwich , and the el toro salad . all of us were very happy with our selections and the very reasonable selection . i ' ll agree with some of the other reviewers that the tables chair are very close , but it didn ' t detract from the experience . looking forward to stopping by again in the near future . 
great lunch , duck sandwich was wonderful . will be going back again for dinner with my wife . the only reason for the last star being left out is because of the dated decor , which i understand will be renovated soon . i hope so ! 
delicious . best eggplant parm sub ever . very friendly service , high quality ingredients . very quick delivery . 
pan con bistec is not good . the beef was not that great . i enjoyed the plaintains and dip they put on the table for us . i tasted a friends arroz con pollo and it was just okay - lots of fat left on the chicken . service was slow . i don ' t think i will be returned . 
excellent food , great pricing and a very friendly staff , my favorite place to eat dinner at now and love the fact its only a mile down the street from me . 
wow ! i really owe one to my work colleague that told me about this place . great dinner -- amazing ricotta , handmade pastas , grilled octopus and interesting desserts . very friendly service . extensive wine list . nice contemporary decor . and all reasonably priced . . . am i really in nyc ? ! ! ! pinch me i must be dreaming . i actually am dreaming about my next return to l ' artusi . 
wow ! ! ! top chef harold dieterle has totally outdone himself ! i am an avid diner and this was one of my best dining experience to date ! ! ! the decor is simple and cofortable with great lighting , inviting colors , and cozy , clean restrooms . the service was outstanding , with incredibly knowledgable , helpful , friendly staff and even an insightful bar staff with a great knowledge of their wines and other products . but the real shining star in this restaurant is the food . great diverse menu selections and my group of five shared everything ( with no qualms by the staff - they were very helpful dividing portions and what-not ) , so i got to sample many items off of the menu . the duck , cod , lamb , and skirt steak were amazing , with delicious accompaniments , and i can honestly say that every morsel of everything i tasted was superb . never have i witnessed this in a restaurant before . hats off to harold and his new location . do not miss this one ! ! ! ! 
i hear the food is great . i go for the ambience , the great selection of wine and the great people i meet at the bar . stanton , the bartender , is a major plus for the place . he remembers your name and is ready with a superb wine that suits your mood . i love the music they play in the background . loungey funky cool . 
had the sicilian and it was a great slice - as good as i ' ve ever had . unfortunately the chicken francaise slice had a hair baked into it which was gross . staff were very friendly and professional . immediately took the charge off the bill . i ' d go back , but not in a rush . 
it was good , then when i order pepperoni grinder , all i get was bread stuffed with a little bit of pizza pepperoni in it . not worth the N . N
steak , steak , steak . . mmmm . if ur a guy just skip the salad bar ( which is rly good ) n go all out on the meats , which r basically seasoned wit only salt . u will never move , u just sit n the meat comes to u . i recommend eating the meat only wit the some fried banana , which are pretty good . prepare like for any buffet cuz u need to get ur moneys worth . if ur in the mood for meat , this is the spot . its a chain but it keeps the quality control pretty well as far as ive seen . 
hibachi dinners are hugely expensive . after you ' ve seen it and eaten it a few times try the regular restaurant and menu . while still pricey you have many more choices and can still get the hibachi items cooked in the kitchen . pretty decent place overall but be prepared to spend N-N per person before drinks and tip . 
i ' m a pj ' s first timer in west windsor and i enjoyed the experience . although i haven ' t been to the princeton pj ' s , i don ' t mind it because there is plenty of parking space in the west windsor one . the inside was decent - it was small but not too small you ' d feel cramped next to people . the booths are pretty wide . on estimate , i ' d say inside the place can hold around N families . i noticed they had a long table by the windows so families with many kids could benefit from that . they have a counter area if you want to eat there and there are flat screens to keep you entertained . service was prompt and food came out hot . i did read prior to coming here that pancakes weren ' t great . i loved mine as they were fluffy and huge . i do believe that this pj ' s will work out the kinks in the future . the servers look young and somewhat unsure and shy , but i didn ' t mind this . service was quick and the quality of the food was better than expected - and i stress better than expected . i fully expect this place to get crowded once people start catching on . i recommend this place to anyone ! 
came here this week with great expectations but left sorely disappointed . the tagliolini was way overcooked - pasta soft , squid hardened , mussels dry . one shrimp was fine but the rest of the dish was hardly enjoyable edible . not sure if this was an off-night - if this is the pasta everyone ' s raving about . . . something ' s not right . we also ordered the lamb chop special that i was not blown away with and the spinaci was a tad too sour for our liking - some balance in that dish would have been appreciated . all in all , the only dish we enjoyed was the chicken liver appetizer and what a great price for a very hearty dish . overall , have to admit that bianca offers great prices for their dishes , but when quality standards are not on par , i ' m not sure i ' d be swayed to come here again simply based on price . 
one of my faves ! this is the go to spot for breakfast or lunch for my bf and i . great coffee ! they have a small menu but offer great , different choices . always great service . the book store is also amazing so take a moment to peruse after you ' ve refueled at the cafe . 
my husband and i went to little fish for dinner friday night and we both agreed that we wanted to go again soon . the dishes are really well-balanced , with flavors and acidity . we loved the hamachi and thought the octopus was really interesting and super delicious . i didn ' t love my main dish , the monkfish , because i thought the flavors were kind of boring , but my husband really liked it . the dessert selection was not extensive ( apple pie or panna cotta ) . we got the pie and it was average . it ' s such a small place , i understand that they don ' t have a special pastry chef . the ambiance was okay , i thought it was a little awkward when people came into the restaurant and waited to be seated , there is no foyer , so they are standing awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant . staff was pleasant and service was good . overall , it was a great place and good experience . 
i remember when you got N slices and a coke for N . N at di fara . this was expensive back in the N ' s . my friends and i would shop around back then and get N slices and a coke for N . N . back then there was a great pizza shop every other N blocks . all the old time italians used to make great pizza . too bad you guys never had armondo ' s on kings highway and east Nth street . best pizza in the city back then . well di fara is the type of pizza you used to get all the time in brooklyn . but thoses days are over . enjoy it now . he ' s an old man . when he retires there will be no one left who makes pizza this good . his pizza is N stars . i give him N because N years ago he chased me and my friends out of the shop with a long butcher knife . thank god we were faster . he still gives me dirty looks . - ) 
i tried the famous ippudo with my friend last night . but unfortunately i felt too much msg in the soup , in my ordered " shiromau ramen " . it was all the fats pork soup , so i couldn ' t taste it but later on my foot become red and swollen ( i will be not returning . . . 
how i love thee , black n brew . how very much indeed . why no N-star review ? i ' ll get that out of the way . . . no blue packets . big pain in my rear . and i would really prefer it if you were open a little later . i would kill to have your tofu scramble for dinner . why can ' t you do this , damnit ? ok - now i will yelp poetic all up on you . coffee so good . menu makes me insane with glee . the space induces a strange relaxation response . regular customers are folk that make me happy - everyone from hipsters to gymgoing muscleboys . i have been making morning pilgrimages here with a friend almost weekly - and we are kept happy with coffee , soy shakes , and brunch fare . so , that being said . . . can you get some equal over there at the condiment counter ? cause that would really be great . 
this location meets the standard of cheesecake factory . the inside interior and ambiance are the same as other cheesecake factory locations . foods are great and portion size is big . i ordered the fetucinni pasta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend ordered a rib-eye steak . i liked the pasta more than the steak it was creamy , warm , and sweet from the sundried tomatoes . the steak seemed very typical , nothing special and it was ok . this place is packed . you should expect to wait for a long time to get seated and high noise level . it ' s not an upscale , high end restaurant but still you can have a good time with our friend . 
they got rid of the croissant french toast in favor of that brioche nonsense , ugh ! ! food otherwise is really good ! 
we loved chop shop . we arrived after N N , didn ' t have reservations , and were seated within N mins . the place was packed . the food was insanely good and we ordered most of the special menu . my favorite dish was the fried black bass with cilantro and lime , seriously well done . the waitress was super friendly and we are coming again . thank you chop shop ! 
were there this past sunday . restaurant looks good food looked good too . there was four of us for brunch we got a table fast . . . . ) but waited more than Nhr and no food , so we walked out . people after us got their food much faster ! ! ! ! no one came to say what is going on . . . . . when we asked to see a the manager no one came , so we left . ran into the manger in Nst and told him what happened no reaction not even come back and i charge you N N off . . . . . . . . nothing . so bad . . . ( 
pros - food is great and reasonably priced . chicken pio is tasty and not dry at all . the ceviche is perfect . my husband ordered the seafood on wheat and he loved it as well . he said the squid , shellfish , shrimp and scallops are cooked perfectly . the avocado salad is fresh . - wait staff is friendly and professional ( i think his name is abel ) . i didn ' t have to ask for water . . . the guy was there all the time checking what i need without being overbearing . cons - seems like the receptionist is clueless about the hospitality business . my husband and i went there at N N on saturday and i know that they are busy on weekends . . . . but at N N , the place was empty . she wanted to sit us on a table for two but since my husband and i tend to order N or N entrees so we can take leftovers home , we requested a four-tops . she gave us four-tops but told us that we need to get out of there before N N pm . we left at N N and the place is still empty . if the place was full , it would have been okay for us to sit wherever they want to sit us . . . but it was empty and i don ' t think our request was unreasonable . i thought it was rude of her to do that . we wanted to stay for dessert because i heard they have great pianono , but we decided to leave because the receptionist said we " have to get out of there before Npm . " 
holy grail . i visited new york for the weekend , and stayed in a loft that was directly across the street from roberta ' s . holy shit . pizza paradise ? i think so . from the outside it doesn ' t look like much , so my expectations weren ' t too high , but the very second we stepped inside i knew we ' d be in for a treat . the atmosphere is very casual and hipster-y , the crowd was young and stylish , and they were playing tlc . uh , yes please . we approached the hostess and she told us the wait for a table would be about N-N minutes . i normally never wait that long for a table , but we were so set on having lunch here that we didn ' t even care . we told them that we would gladly wait and they directed us to the bar area while we waited for an available table . after a couple of drinks , our table finally became available and we both ordered pizzas . incredible . my friend ordered the margherita ( and added jalapenos ) and i had the rosso . so damn good , it should be criminal . normally , when i ' m on vacation , i don ' t really like visiting the same place twice ( i like to experience as many places as i possibly can ) but we actually came back a second time right before our flight to grab a few more drinks and to socialize with the locals . good times . i love this place . i ' ll definitely be coming back whenever i ' m in town again . xx mj
very nice , not so much a gastropub but a great bar with great food . the place gets ten out of ten for the lighting , design and atmosphere . best blood and sand ! cocktails are really good too . cute bartenders with even cuter accents . service not so quick and is really hard to find but overall really well done space and nice fit for Nth street . great for drink parties . 
good food , ok prices , not authentic colombian , but good tasting , i am colombian and we have other variety and that is not on the menu . 
hands down , this is the best falafel i ' ve had . i ' m not a huge falafal fan in the first place but i think the falafel from this place has converted me into a fan . i particularly like how the falafel itself isn ' t as fried as most places , the vegetables are seasoned and they give you free pickles as a topping ! the sandwich doesn ' t seem to be a lot but its actually quite filling . i would definitely travel to specifically get this ! 
we came to the caf last night and had maggie as our server- she was perfection . our family is full of self proclaimed wine snobs- she recommended two separate bottles to us that were both absolutely incredible . she was charming , funny , and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu in its entirety ( food , wine , dessert , etc ) . the food was wonderful , but even if it wasn ' t i would come back solely for the astounding service that maggie offered us- she is an absolute gift . well done , white dog caf ! 
what an amazing meal and experience we had there ! ambiance is great--hard to explain but you do walk by the open kitchen on your way in which is innovative and cool , and such a small kitchen that still produces such incredible food ! made a reservation and the table was all ready--lovely , bright yellow , very welcoming decor and right away you know you ' re in for a special evening . we had the entire staff of four assisting us throughout the evening , which is so good to keep everything moving . brought our own bottle of wine , which the first waiter opened as he told us the evening ' s specials , and we were off ! we had a veal dish which was fantastic , their gnocchi in an asiago and thyme cream sauce , also wonderful , some kind of shredded duck and pasta which again , was innovative and delicious and some of their own homemade pasta in an eggplant tomato sauce . . . all delectable . dessert was a combo of canolis and caramel gelato and when someone leaked the news that it was our wedding anniversary celebration , they added a candle and beautifully written " happy anniversary " on the plate in caramel creme ! prices were very reasonable , service excellent , a little long between appetizers and entrees , but they had a very large party ahead of us but it didn ' t matter--you don ' t want to rush though dinner there--it ' s very relaxing and puts you and keeps you in a good mood the whole time . . . can you tell that we really enjoyed it ! worth a trip down broad street---you will not be disappointed ! 
got takeout there for the first time last night . lobster roll had decent amount of meat and the roll was nice and buttery . my companion liked the cuban but thought it needed something . added mustard and then was in love . both were served with side salad and fries . good deal for what you get . plus the woman at the counter tossed in a bonus muffin ! 
horray for in riva bringing some life to east falls ! ! great food , great drinks , great atmosphere , great service , score . do not miss out on the caprese salad or tuna ( whachamacallit ) . i look forward to taking a stroll down kelly drive and hanging on the outdoor patio come spring , and trying everything else on the menu . 
i had higher expectations for catfish , but i left unsatisfied . it ' s not often that i leave brunch complete unhappy with my food , but that ' s what happened last sunday . i ordered to eggs over medium ( they were over-cooked ) with home fries and greens . i would have preferred steam greens , but was served salad with way too much vinegar . the home fries looked exciting but were lackluster . not seasoned well nor were they fully cooked . my boyfriend ordered the pain perdu , or french toast . it was delicious ! decadent , tasty and served with berries soaked in port . yum ! we also enjoyed an order or andouille sausage , also tasty . my bloody mary was the best part of my brunch . perfectly made with a delicious rim . that goodness for that drink ! my initial order left me wanting , so i ordered some biscuits and honey butter for my boyfriend and i to share . the biscuit was very dense and quite disappointing , perhaps not enough butter in the batter ? the honey butter was okay and helped a little , but as my wordsmith boyfriend said " it ' s like putting honey butter on a piece of cardboard . " well said . the butter kept sliding of instead of being absorbed into the flaky type of biscuit that we know love . as for service , the waitress was flustered as though the restaurant was packed and she was by herself . the spot was not half full , nor was she alone . on a brighter note , the layout is inviting with great light . i will likely be back to check out the bar and maybe dinner , as catfish is close to my apartment . 
i ' ve been to witherspoon grill several times . the biggest issue is the very high prices however , their lunch menu is much more affordable . i absolutely love their lobster risotto , probably one of my favorite dishes ever . the service is always very good and welcoming . 
read my lips . . . just tasty palatable . . . 
a great place for shopping for italian foods and for eating lunch or dinner . there are several eating areas inside the store , specific for pasta , seafood , meat and vegetables . fresh baked beads snd . pasta . also hss a small accessary section and cooking classes . will definitely visit again . 
i never give bad reviews but i ' m so irritated . i called and asked if they delivered and was told yes and there was no minimum delivery . i call back ten minutes later , give my entire order and credit card number , say it ' s delivery and am then told they can ' t deliver at this time after being put on hold so she can check with the manager . it was the same person i had just spoke with ten minutes ago . extremely frustrating ! ! ! 
N for the breakfast sandwich
i had the lobster bisque again recently and it was wayyy too salty . salty enough for me to never want to try it again ( although it was good enough the previous time for me to want to have it again . 
like this place . . . . . good food . . . good people
amazing steak sandwich . 
the chocolate mousse cheesecake was good but the price for a slice was well pricey N . N . 
had their roti canai . . yuck . . it didn ' t come close to what panang has . don ' t understand the name healthy food when the roti was deep fried with some disgusting tasting oil . we squeezed the roti and got about half a cup oil out of it . never going back . 
why do i try to come here again ever ! ? ! ? ? ! ! get this- so they have no prices on the beer menu , but they also don ' t give sample pours ! ! ! ! ! ! so just go ahead and get a beer you don ' t know is N and not even be able to sample it . suck it , local N ! ! ! ! 
food is good . only thing need to take care is sometime chef makes vey spicy dishes . so inform them about your preferred spice level or taste
the thing that most carries this place is the vibe . it ' s a lot of fun . plus the margaritas have an effervescence or a slight bubbly quality that makes them memorable . the food is great too . 
best pizza ever . give me a tray now ! ! ! ! ! 
long wait . . . ridiculously small dining area given the hype buckwheat waffles w bourbon maple syrup were amazing , but not worth the one-hour wait unless i had time to kill
love love love this place ! although the venue is on the smaller side and so are the portions it ' s perfect for lunch with one of your girlfriends or a romantic evening with your man ! 
i had this posted the other day , but somehow they removed it . . . . . . . . . . . . went back today after i swore it off N yrs ago . food is still very slow coming out , but food was warm this time ( shocker ) we sat down at a sticky table realized everything around us was dirty . then noticed the whole time there , none of the tables were being wiped down prior to people sitting . they just rearrange table top wipe off any debris . very gross won ' t ever go back . better off going to a diner . 
still the chicest place to get brunch in the city . it ' s been there for years and will continue to be there because the food is excellent . the bread is great , and they know how to poach an egg . it ' s very relaxed with just a touch of glamour . great people watching . 
on a summer evening the continental ' s rooftop deck has some charm . you can smoke out there , that ' s for one . the baby trees smattered around the patio give the space a less concrete-boxed in feel ( it is , in actuality , pretty boxed-in ) . i can ' t speak to the food , since none of it looked all that original or impressive . we each ordered a martini . i asked for mine with three olives and the waiter gave me the option of whether i wanted the lemon rind stuffed olives or the traditional . i asked for two lemon and one regular and he didn ' t blink twice . the lemon stuffed olives ended up being quite a nice mash up of flavors and textures . all three of us were rather disappointed by the plastic glasses in which our martinis were served . while it wasn ' t the most expensive drink i ' ve ever bought , at N we expected the satisfying clink of glass on glass when we cheersed . drink was decent , nice and dirty . this is not as ' special ' a place as it sells itself , but isn ' t completely without its charms . 
i go to bar on tuesday nights . there is a N cover but well worth it . if you go to the back bar the drinks from N to N are N for all well drinks and domestic beers . the service is good and the pizza is very good . not as good as pepe ' s but who is . tuesdays is alternative night and there is a good mix of people . 
my husband and i visit peppinos once a week and always enjoy the food . i just wanted to let everyone know what type of people they are . i know a neighborhood girl that married and moved to breezy point to raise her N children and has recently been displaced because of hurricane sandy . when i mentioned it to one of the owners of peppinos they immediately invited the intire family for dinner on them . these are real family , neighborhood people ! god bless them for doing such a good thing ! 
a casual , seafood shack with a friendly staff . just what the neighborhood needs . so far at lolo ' s we ' ve tried the soft shell crab sandwich , the ribs and the gruyere and callilou crab dip--all winners ! i ' m getting hungry as i type . i can see a lot of meals on their back patio come the spring . i ' d love a few more sandwich choices like a spicy dolphin or grouper sandwich but not on the menu ( yet ) hey they just opened . other restaurants in the area , this is what the people want . take notes affordable meals , fast , friendly service in a chill atmosphere . no uptight fa ades here . 
my husband and i go here a lot ! i think if you are coming to nyc and don ' t try halal guys you definitely will be missing out . it ' d definitely a go-to ! 
brunch at sanford is a safe , solid outing for friends , family , and the date you met online who you do not recognize due to inconsistencies with her profile . for N dollars you get a hearty meal with N cold and N hot drink . the drinks come with N refill . the bloody mary tastes exactly like tomato juice , which i couldn ' t stand . my alcoholic friends happily chugged it with no complaints . the hot cocoa ( its actually hot chocolate . huge difference ) is my fav hot drink with chocolates bits still hugging the side of the cup and the bottom of the spoon . na ' mean ? everything is supersized diner style . see menu sanfordsnyc . com sanf br the steak skillet is a super heavy platter of steak mixed with cheese and potatoes . a few spoon of these and you ' re guaranteed to hate yourself . the eggs benedicts , waffles , and croque madame are equally filling and self-loathe afflicting . large yes , but the meals are also consistently good and a bang for the buck . for those who play it safe can go for the N eggs sausage home fries routine . yes - that sausage got girth a big drawback is the ridiculous wait which can go up to N mins on sundays . it ' s also not an ideal place for slow and quiet chat , as the sure packed place will assuredly be boisterous . the long lines following you will also peer pressure you to gtfo . the service is quick . the plates were immediately taken away once we finished and the check readied . the staff is definitely working in overdrive mode to get everyone in and out as quickly as possible . if you stubbornly stay around , nobody is going to come bother you . ( except if i was on the line and saw you i will probably beat you with a baguette ) . we were not asked about refills . the hostess looks like mila kunis . dead serious . not related to any personal anecdotes . i promise . do i have to use that word ? yes . 
not like the original . i mean not only did you get my order wrong . you told me i had to tell you to chop the meat ! to think i drove from dc here for the dole purpose of showing my wife a great cheesesteak and left with a poor facsimile of an original great . i ' ll go to jim ' s next time or back to the original . 
ok , i am a kid , i know i am not supposed to write reviews on the best restaurant in the world . let me just say i had the best cheeseburger in the world at the little owl . perfectly cooked classic burger bun N or N slices of firm juicy mouth watering bacon N or N slices of melted american cheese one blessed cow . N more perfect bun i went there for my graduation dinner and it was way more than i expected . my family heard that some critics said that the little owl was the best burger in the world but and i totally agree . i cant comment about the alcohol but the iced tea was great . the service was more than i can ask for my sis wanted tomato juice and the waitress said she might have it in the basement and she went in to the basement and got it . the location was perfect . there was not a lot of cars beeping ( in fact there was none at all ) it was quite busy but not loud . tip make a reservation next i will try the pork cops me and my dad are trying to recreate the burger but i don ' t think we will come close . the desert was great
i have been eating at the jewel of india for several years and love their food . my favorites are the vegetable samosas and the lamb korma but have had almost everything on their menu . i live N minutes away and will drive here often just to have dinner . often i will have dinner with my boss , who stayed in india for a month and considers this the best authentic indian food restaurant here . 
i would give this place zero stars if yelp would let me . N ) they ran out of tuna . at Npm . at a sushi restaurant ? ? N ) took N minutes from ordering to getting food . no comp , apologies , or anything . N ) rolls were tiny , overpriced , and had barely any actual fish inside of them . rice was soggy , sticky ( not in the good way ) . my yellowtail looked grey . i ' ve actually never had such a bad sushi experience in my life . thank god i don ' t live in burlington , so will never have to pass this god forsaken place again . 
best jewish style deli in the new haven area ! egg cream , borscht and chopped liver all very good ( just not all mixed together ) . 
probably the best hidden gem in downtown philly . great food menu , their oysters are the best , their sand smelt are also good . good selection of wines , great service by ameer one of the best shuckers i ' ve seen around and you can ' t beat their buck-a-shuck happy hour deals . 
great value . i ' ve been eating here for years ! this is one of the best eating deals in burlington . it is also run by a wonderful family . 
i don ' t know what the hype is about but this place is good but not the best ramen in town . if you get there anytime after N , be ready to wait for an hour for party of N , any bigger party be ready to wait up to N hours . i always order the miso or standard ramen with pork . i think the soup base is just way to oily . i must say the pork bun is the best thing there . it melts in your mouth . if you really want to wait that long for expensive ramen , give it a try . definitely overrated ! ! 
authentic pizza napoletana , fresh ingredients . great selection of wines and beers . try tiramisu ! 
friday saturday sunday is pretty cool , we went there for valentine ' s day and certainly did not regret it . made reservations ahead of time , and when arrived there the place was empty , that took me by surprise b c i was told that this place is popular , but ok . within N N an hour the place started to fill up and after an hour the place was packed . expect to be served small to medium sized portions , so definitely sharing is a bit awkward . the food is prepared very well , we definitely enjoyed our time there and would return as opportunity presents it ' s self . 
cute little place with a down home type menu . the outdoor seating rocks , except when the saturday night drinks are out and screaming in the streets . definitely sit outside during the week ! ! the rooftop bar is much better , when it is open during the summer . menu is decent , like i said it is the place to go for that feeling of a home cooked meal . macaroni and cheese is delicious ! ! the pot roast is another of my favorites , along with the sheppards pie . 
this is perhaps the best place in the city to go for mexican food and margaritas . it is also one of the best happy hours in philly . the atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty casual and gives off a bit of a hipster vibe . i ' ve been here a number of times and no matter if you sit at the bar or get a table the service is always great . my go to order is the chicken tinga nachos with a margarita pitcher . they use their own freshly made chips for the nachos and smother them with cheese , black beans , sour cream , jalapenos , and your choice of protein . a small order is plenty for two people . you can get the margaritas frozen or on the rocks and they come in a number of flavors . the blood orange is especially good . for happy hour ( N-N ) the pitchers are half off , so definitely a plus if you can get in early . 
i ' ve only eaten here once , but my husband and i enjoyed it . nice drinks , good service , not much atmosphere , and large flat screen over the bar . we haven ' t gone back because it ' s kind of pricey , but i would recommend it . 
very nice dinner . there were six of us and everyone really enjoyed the food . we had several appetizers and all were excellent . the only one we didn ' t love was the fried calamari . for dinner arroz con pollo , suckling pig , short ribs , black cod were all excellent . we didn ' t have desert . the service was outstanding , they filled water glasses after you drank a N N of it . 
i don ' t have any reasons to give it less than N stars . the food was amazing , every dish we asked . the crispy calamari , the rucula salad , the eggplant parmesan , the ravioli , the lasagna . . . . even the cookies for dessert and the machiatto . great service and affordable prices . cute place . can ' t wait to go back . 
amazing bartenders awesome atmosphere couldn ' t ask for a better bar in the theatre district ! ! ! ! ! ! ask for gerry the bartender he brings life to the bar , is very welcoming , and makes you ' re time tht much better . 
okay the customer service is great and the place looks really cool from the inside . the decor is very hipsterish ( not a word but that can kinda explain what is looks like ) which i like so why not N stars well . . . . it ' s definitely not a place i want to go to at night especially when it looks uber creepy on the outside and while you ' re walking from the train station to roberta ' s . now . . . the pizza is great i went there with my nieces and nephew . we order the margherita , el supermo and the bee sting . we did order some gelato but i wasn ' t that much of a fan of it over all my experience was great . 
a bit overrated in my opinion , but still a really great sandwich option . i feasted on the middle eastern vegan . personally , the eggplant felt out of place with the sauce they used , but overall a good experience for my taste buds . 
first of all , let ' s be clear that if you ' re going to geno ' s , you should not be expecting a N-star fine dining experience served up on a golden platter with a glass of champagne . . . it ' s a cheesesteak shop of god ' s sake ! ! it ' s where you go to enjoy a fast , greasy , calorie-filled sandwich ! the guy at the window seems to speak his own language when he ' s yelling the orders back to the sandwich makers , and that ' s all part of the experience . i ordered a geno ' s sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a pat ' s sandwich , both the traditional way ( whiz-wit - that means cheese-whiz and grilled onions on top ) and we tasted them side by side . without a doubt , geno ' s is the winner . their bread is so much better , and they didn ' t overdo the cheese whiz , plus they wrapped it up nicely so the sandwich didn ' t spill all over the place as we walked to our seats ( can ' t say the same about pat ' s ) . the geno ' s sandwich was not only more delicious , it was bigger too ! win-win ! sure , there ' s usually a really long line , and afterwards you might ask yourself , " why did i eat that ? that was so unhealthy ! " but then you ' ll come to your senses and say , " i ' m so glad i had that delicious taste of cheesesteak heaven and i don ' t care if i just gained N pounds ! " if you ' re looking for the authentic philly cheesesteak experience , with all the grease and calories included , geno ' s is where to find it . 
heard this place was good . came here for valentine ' s day and was dissapointed . first off they do not have a parking lot , its valet only and there ' s was like a N dollar fee . that ' s fine and all but it looked like it was contracted out to two guys with a beat up suv with a homemade key board . i passed on that . they were extremely busy that night ( understandable , it was a holiday ) however the hosted didn ' t even take my name when we walked in . several other couples who arrived after us were greeted first . i spoke to her and told her she overlooked us and reminded her we had reservations . we were promptly seated . . . . . at the worst table in the corner by the fire extinguisher . . . waiter was friendly but was overwhelmed , not his fault , the place was obviously not ready for the amount of people that came in . the menu was very limited , i understand why but there was nothing out of the ordinary . she ordered the pasta with clams , muscles , shrimp , and scallops . honestly everything was over cooked and bland . pasta wasn ' t drained and sauce was meh . next to us was a pair of older couples and one of the dudes was obnoxious to the point of me having words with him . decor was old and the place was dark . probably just went on a bad night but for the money i won ' t risk going again . 
great fresh and nutritious food for a really reasonable price served by really personable people . love it ! had the carolina bbq chicken and cream of cauliflower soup . wish they had these in texas . well done reviver ! ! 
what ? ! first off yum ! this place is delish , i came a few weeks ago with a couple of friends and we had to restrain ourselves from licking the plates . we ordered the mac and cheese , chicken and waffles ( obv ) , and the s ' mores and a few drinks and it was all so good . the mac and cheese was amazing , it has a ritz cracker topping i don ' t even have words for it was so good . i had the daily special chicken tika with taziki sauce and a spinach onion and cheese waffle , my friends had spicy honey chicken one with a bacon waffle and one with a regular , it was a very quiet meal . i think we only came up for air to say things like " oh my god " and " why is this so good ? " . the s ' mores in a jar was amazing even if it was hard to share with the marshmallow sticking to spoon . the drinks were great too , come during the happy hour when they ' re N and beers are N . whole staff is helpful , nice to talk to and actually seems like they like their job which is rare . i used to be a waitress and i hated it and everyone . i love you sweet chick , i ' ll be back . 
i came on a thursday afternoon and it was empty except for one other girl drinking a beer by the door . i walked straight to the counter and looked at the menu . i got the half salad and half sandwich and was directed to sit anywhere i wanted . i was brought utensils and water immediately which was efficient . my food came quickly and it was surprisingly pretty good . i wouldn ' t say it was the freshest lettuce i ' ve ever had in a salad but it was definitely good . the caesar dressing wasn ' t over powering and the turkey wasn ' t dry . it was good for what it was . i would come back again for the quiet atmosphere which is nice to study since it is right across the street from city college . there is also free wifi and the waiter provided me with the password before i even asked . 
i ' m a sucker for unlimited sangria . 
so , we ' ve been to twenty manning several times in the past and , while i ' ve always found the food to be fine , i ' ve also always found the bartenders to be slightly on the snooty side . however , the restaurant is less than aN minute walk from our house , so we go there for dinner occasionally and i really want to like it b c it has a pretty good atmosphere . on this most recent occasion we met a friend for drinks and decided to order dinner from the bar . we were very quickly provided with bread and our appetizer . . . . great ! then N minutes later , we still had no dinner , after watching a couple who were still seated at the bar when we ordered , be seated and have their dinner delivered to their table , my husband gave up . after seeing this and went to the bar to settle our bill . we were , unfortunately , charged for the dinner we never received . while they reversed the charge without debate , the response was " we must have missed you " . that ' s it . if someone has waited over N minutes for a dinner that never comes , and then are also charged for it , i don ' t think that ' s an appropriate response . we informed the hostesses , in a non-confrontational manner , and they were apologetic , but it was definitely an unfortunate experience , and we left hungry . and it was made exponentially worse by the bartender ' s response to our informing her of it . poor showing , twenty manning and i doubt we return for a long time , if ever . 
pros what they do , they do well ( i . e . dark beer , meat , cheese ) cons not a lot of " lighter " options . would definitely recommend for a hearty winter ' s night meal . 
daniel and mike created a product that is absolutely delicious . super affordable and very laid back atmosphere . the ice cream sandwiches are to die for . will be back . . . tomorrow
i recommend great jones to everyone i know , even if they are only coming to new york for a visit . i came for brunch by myself . while there would have been a wait for a table , i luckily immediately found a single place at the bar . the cafe is small and intimate your experience is sure to be personal . i had one of their cajun bloody mary ' s . it was exactly what i needed to take the edge off my hangover . the biscuits and gravy were not typical southern fare . instead , they had a cajun twist andouille sausage instead of regular breakfast sausage ! if you appreciate cajun cuisine , please try great jones . it won ' t disappoint . 
i had the worst experience with this restaurant . i booked a sunday brunch for my mom ' s birthday and had a reservation for N people , coming from all over . two weeks before the event , i called up to confirm some details , and they told me " oh sorry , you can ' t do it here that day . we just got in a big party . " i ' m not kidding . first of all , they did not call me . they told me when i called them . were they ever planning to call me to tell me ? or would i have showed up on that day with N people and they would have told me then ? second of all , it was two weeks before the event and i was not able to find another restaurant . so they went for money over loyalty of local customers . i would never dream of going back to this restaurant again . 
i came here with a good sized group during the week and was able to get a reservation day of at a good time ( we might not even have needed it ) . this place has a great atmosphere and is decorated well . the service was great , and the food was delicious . we got two orders of guacamole . both were amazing , particularly the spicier option . everyone liked their drinks and meals . we stayed for a while and didn ' t feel pressure to leave . great experience overall ! 
nice alternative place for quick breakfast or lunch . loved the chicken pesto sandwich . . will add it my list of quick and cool meal places . . . 
me and my bf went there today , well it wasn ' t my first time to go there , but our experience today was just really horrible . ok the last time we went there was lunch , about N months ago , it was pretty good , the food looked fresh , it was clean , and it was just nice . today for dinner it was just horrible , very unsanitary . i ' ll begin with the utensils , the drinking glasses were just nasty , they looked like they ' ve never been washed , the spoons have like leftover food in them . while i was walking to get food , i saw that the ice that they put on the drinks were just under the fountain drinks like it was open , like open to anything , not even covered . the food weren ' t fresh at all , they look and taste like they ' ve been sitting there since morning . the chilled cooked shrimp has dark spots on them already , and the food counter was just messy . i saw this lady in the desert section changing the bananas with syrup in them , and i thought she ' s not gonna return the leftover bananas from the other tray which were already darkish in color because it was already old , but she did ! the pineapple wasn ' t even right . when i took the food to our , the food was already cold ! the temperature where the food should be stored wasn ' t just right , and it ' s been sitting there for hours , and it ' s not already safe and sanitary . i understand that the price is very reasonable and as they say you get what you paid for but come on , it ' s not that hard to follow certain guidelines for good food right ? it think the guests there deserve better food . the health inspectors should come to this place and inspect everything . 
fresh fish cake and fish balls made daily . excellent won tons and dumplings . will eat here often . . . . our new favorite in chinatown ! ! ! 
the food and the ambience here is good . i used to dine in weekly . but since my last experience , i ' ll avoid this place in the future . a middle aged lady served us , and she said the fish i ordered was out of stock . it reminded me this was the second time she told me that . ( the first time was weeks ago , i ordered fish , she said it would take a long waiting time and suggested to change the order , i told her i could wait . but she returned later and told me the fish was out of stock . ) this time i know she lied to my face . we did not make the order with her . a new waiter took my fish order without problem and the fish came to our table under N mins . as a waitress , she is not supposed to control our orders , or here for making friends with the chef . and there are a lot of other good restaurants around could give us what are on their menu . 
stopped in while in hanover , great soup and salad bar . staff was nice and attentive . must have made changes since last reviews . 
food was good but overpriced . after our meal , the waiter came around with a tray of dessert , so we got a chocolate mousse cake , and it turned out to be N ! 
this is great cininese dining . the food is tasty , plentiful and the service is top notch . forget the cafeteria setting . go casual and settle in for a feast . and something as great as the food ? the price . there were nine in our party and the bill was less than N . unbelievable . 
it is not the most special kind of pizza , but its good enough to fill up a hungry stomach . i go by sometimes when i want a decent pizza . sure , there are better places , . . . . faaaaar better . but sometimes , the modest pizza is also quite fine . 
one of a kind for completely vegan fusion sushi in manhattan . i ' m honestly surprised that something like this hadn ' t been opened earlier . it ' s conveniently located near union square . better to get take out or come early late if you want to sit inside cause it ' s pretty small and cozy . some of my veggie hating friends have even admitted to liking the rolls here . the spicy mang roll is my favorite , i feel like you can almost never go wrong with some avocado . the rice paper wraps are pretty good too , i tried the sweet angel one . the workers are helpful and friendly and you can watch them make your food . 
best brazilian burger place in newark - hands down ! this isn ' t your typical american burger - these sandwiches are stuffed with everything you can think of ( cheese , ham , bacon , potato sticks , lettuce , tomato , corn , you name it ! ) the sauces on the burger are amazing and give the burger a great taste ! also , try the N ) salgados ( brazilian pastries ) - order the pao de queijo ( cheese braed ) , pastel de carne or queijo ( fried pastry with ground beef or cheese ) or the coxinha ( a chicken ball ) , and N ) vitaminas batidas ( fruitshakes ) - not your typical fruitshakes , these are all natural and aboslutely fantatsic - my favorite , the pinneaple mint . the only downside is the place is very small and the waitresses do have a hard time understanding english every now and then . other than that , it ' s a great place to experience a real brazilian burger ! 
i recently found myself hanging in brooklyn for the day , and my friend toni and i wound up at bijan ' s at the recommendation of a colleague . while i usually follow my own favorites , i ' m glad i listened this time . the space has a creative vibe and being an artist , i loved that they had abstract impressionism on display . didn ' t even pick up a menu yet and i was like " yessss , like that " . the specialty cocktails are inventive ( and tasty ) . i don ' t usually go for a second drink ( lightweight ! ) but i indulged this time , haha . i had the lime sumac chicken and it was amazing , just right . for dessert , i had the tiramisu , which i was told is a family recipe . verdict to . die . for . the service was great and how i like it casual , efficient and not overbearing . also bonus was the music selection eclectic yet fun . i ' ll definitely be back ! ! 
i ate here two or three weeks ago . and sadly , i don ' t remember it . i only had one drink too . i am sure it was probably pretty good , but just not very memorable . i don ' t remember anything being really bad , but nothing that stood as great . what i gather from this is that it ' s an experience . . but just that . i kinda think it ' s unfair to review a place , as many do , just after one visit . i may only go back if someone else has to pay . 
my husband and i were in town for a concert at the xl center and wanted some breakfast before hitting the road back home . not familiar with the area we asked the people at the hotel we stayed at and they were little help . i looked up breakfast spots on yelp and found this gem . after reading some of the reviews we decided to check it out . there was a little wait as the place isn ' t that big , but man was it worth it . i ordered french toast with eggs , bacon and home fries while hubby got a chocolate chip pancake with corned beef hash and eggs over easy . everything was absolutely delicious . the french toast is heavenly and needed very little syrup as the flavor in the toast was sweet enough . hubby loved the corned beef and his pancake was the perfect amount of chocolatey for his taste . we are like pigs and when we got the bill were stunned when all that food only came to N ! ! excellent food , phenomenal service and a great little atmosphere . definitely worth a try if you are in the area ! we will definitely be back if we are in town again . just be aware- it is a cash only business . 
i . love . chicken . and . rice . i love it during the day , i love it in the evenings , i love it at midnight . white sauce ? yes . spicy sauce ? yes . i would recommend putting droplets in . i usually put N droplets . it is that spicy . for those who think it ' s hype , perhaps . i have had my share of chicken and rice carts , and these guys are just the biz . be careful during the late hours , for the crowd can be rowdy . patience , and you ' ll get your fix on . 
one of the great things about ethiopian food is the vegetarian options are just as delicious as the meat options . so i was pumped when i heard there ' s an ethiopian place in montclair when i was in the area . came here on a saturday evening for dinner after making reservation and was able to walk right in with no wait . the restaurant is located right in the middle of town and has a laid back vibe to it . many of the people there seem to be frequent diners . i had the vegetarian sampler which is a mix of six different kinds of vegetables of your choice . it comes on the patented and delicious ethiopian bread that is eaten with the meal . the dish was delicious , however it could have been a little hotter in temperature . that kind of took away from the taste for me . other than that , it was a very enjoyable meal in a very nice restaurant . 
if you need the ultimate atmosphere , whether to impress family , woo a client , celebrate an anniversary or even a marriage , this is the place in north jersey . unbeatable view of the nyc skyline ( you can see fireworks on july N ) , excellent food , great wine selection , attention to detail all around . desserts defy description . it ' s a once or twice a year treat that will make you wish you could go back more . ( and if you can afford to , you should ! ) 
such a welcome addition to tribeca ! the neighborhood ' s strangely lacking in good lunch places , considering how many restaurants there are . this place always has delicious , wholesome food , with a fun mix of spices and flavors . filling , but healthy , with conscientious-foodie feel ( plenty of gluten-free options , too ) . i hope they ' ll start rotating their menu eventually , as i have had their turkey bolognese and kale salad a million times now . but that said , i ' m still loving it ! 
i really enjoyed perilla . i got there early so i had a chance to study the wine list a bit . it ' s a really nice list , especially if you decide to get one of their bottles . i had a glass of the oregon pinot noir ' N , was really nice . we ordered the edamame falafel to share which was good . surprisingly very filling and comes with a lot of falafel so it ' s a good dish to share but don ' t spoil your appetite ! i also had the squash ginger soup . it was excellent . so tasty and just the right amount of ginger . very rich too . for my entree i went with the waitresses suggestion and ordered the duck . i don ' t usually eat duck but it was superb . i had it medium rare . perfect . also very heavy but a nice balance with the pomogranite topping . a very interesting combination that definately works . we were all too stuffed for dessert but the check came with a small cookie for each of us which was a nice touch of sweetness to leave out palettes with . the atmosphere was also very enjoyable and felt intimate and warm . i would definately go back ! 
excellent eatery ! the food is exquisite and from local sources , which we love ! the ambiance is fun and comfortable . the staff is friendly and seems to genuinely like being there . this is an excellent spot with amazing fare ! 
there ' s no better snack to be found in east village than the legendary pommes frites , an authentic ( as authentic as one can get thousands of miles from brussels ) belgian friterie . for around N , grab yourself a regular cone of fresh , thick cut fries , and choose from around N fry sauces . . . ketchup isn ' t recommended here , unless it ' s the curry ketchup ! my personal favorite ? the rosemary garlic . but the sauces make this place you ' d be crazy if you didn ' t select at least three ! note that seating is limited ( three great wooden seats out front , great for people watching , and two communal benches inside ) . definitely a to-go atmosphere . best fries in town , and as i ' m reviewer N , obviously others would agree . 
 please note we were extremely intoxicated when we ate here . holy toledo ! who knew meatballs would rock my world in such a way ? ! i love this little restaurant and stumbled in after a night of seemingly endless cocktails . located in the les , the meatball shop is an unassuming gem where you can get a bowlful of comfort in a jiffy . when you sit down to order they give you a menu and you check off your meatball order with an expo pen . that way you can customize your balls just the way you like it . how ' s that for a revelation ? a restaurant which wants its customers to have what they want , in the way that they want it ! ! ! here ' s what we ordered . . . bitches brew a mix of blue moon , orange juice and soda , this concoction is a drink everyone in our party enjoyed ! it ' s really refreshing and very dangerous ! meatballs , meatballs , meatballs we ordered several combinations of meatballs ( too many for me to recount in detail due to alcohol overconsumption ) . i like to call it a meatball orgy and everyone was invited . the more the merrier i always say ! my bf ' s favorite was the spicy pork meatball with spicy sauce . it had a really nice zip to it and i appreciated that even if you don ' t like spicy , you ' d stil enjoy the kick . my favorite was the plain meatball with tomato sauce . i ' m a simple girl and i think a meatball establishment should be able to win your over with the basics ! they succeeded ! everything was so delicious ! ! ! all the balls were moist , covered in freshly grated parmesan , smothered in wonderful sauces , and served with a slice of focaccia bread . ( photo of our meatball orgy yelp . com biz photos pNhm ) this location is very small but it ' s the intimate feel of the restaurant that makes it truly special . it ' s got a full bar and we hung out at the high boys by the window . the meatball shop makes for great late night people watching and is a must if you ' re hanging out latenight in les ! ! ! meatball orgy for everyone ! ! ! ! 
i tend to shy away from seafood and sushi restaurants . when i decide to be adventurous , i head to ichiban . i have yet to find a better sushi bar in the hartford area . i stick to eel , tuna and salmon hand rolls . i find them very tasty . i ' ve also had their bbq dishes and they hit the spot . their seaweed salad is good too . sometimes ordering had been a challenge as the servers don ' t speak the best english . overall it ' s a good sushi and japanese restaurant . . 
great place to chill and have some good korean . i haven ' t tried the love octopus , but the bbq items are great . the place is relaxing , and it ' s a nice experience with a group of friends . 
first things first , i absolutely fell in love with this place first going inside . visiting this place today really was a spontaneous visit but a for sure thing that will happen occasionally ! what grabbed me inside as i was about to walk past this place and head to another place next door . the black neon chalk written sign brought me in with it saying " grilled chicken with rice ( green salad w ginger dressing ) all for N . N ! " , i immediately thought you can ' t beat that and i wanted to try something different , than the average grab a slice and go home . i walked inside of i tea and the place was beautiful . i loved the chic feel but lounge type setting the restaurant displayed . they also had the culture ' s music playing in the background the lighting was really pretty . first , i walked up to the counter and asked the young lady who seemed to be a young girl ( whom was really nice btw ) asked me what i would like . told her this was my first time being here and i would like to try the grilled chicken with rice ( green salad w ginger dressing ) , i got a egg roll on the side which was N . N cool in my book . after placing my order , i went to have a seat and waited approx N minutes for my food . everything came out delish ! they serve you as if you are in a restaurant . ( normal chinese places i know make you come pick it up ) , so that was a plus ! for style ) ! ! ! ! lastly , i was satisfied with their overall customer service and couldn ' t have asked for better ! definitely will be going again ! 
the duck dinner is deceptively large . sure it looks like a bunch of veggies , some scallion pancake and a few slices of duck over rice , but that dish is deeper than you think and the duck fat that seeps into the rice pretty much guarantees you will be full at the end of it . first of all , coming here with N girls and N guys , the waiter recommended that we order additional food while we wait for the duck . that was completely unnecessary . we ordered N orders of the pork buns ( N buns in each order ) and N of the larger fried pork buns with tomato . surprisingly , we all like the fried buns better ! ! ! i don ' t see it on the online menu so i can ' t recall the specific name , but they were shockingly good . good news is , they rocked . bad news is , we spent N on buns before the duck hit our table and were already full . anyway , then the duck came and it was fabulous . however , we probably picked the wrong N sides that came with it because we ordered swiss chard ( the seasonal veggie of the day ) and fingering potatoes . neither was anything to write home about . i actually found the fingerling potatoes to be super starchy and undercooked - really the first bad thing i ' ve ever had at any momofuku establishment . a total waste of a side ! drink-wise , we tried pretty much all of the cocktails . i told the waiter i liked boozier drinks so he told me i could try the vieux carr . my fault b c i said boozy ( i meant boozy but tasty ) , but this thing burned my insides . the strongest drink i ' ve ever had , hands down . as with every time i dine at a momofuku establishment - i left here feeling over indulgent and slightly bloated from the mass consumption . however , the food was pretty good and it may just be worth the tremendous calorie load . 
fantastic tapas spot ! great place to stop by with friends for easy conversation and great food at reasonable prices . the lamb meatballs as well as the brussel sprouts are utterly divine . no human can resist a second order of the deliciously cute veggies . 
best food vibe staff in the city ! i love to go there and relax , eat till my heart is content , and get free coffee refills ! must go ! 
only had their chicken and waffles waffle is not of the best quality but the chicken is really good . . plus for the price the condiments that come along with the take out is not to up to par crappy and disappointing cuz yes i expect actual real maple syrup with my order not chefs quality 
one of my favorite restaurants and it never lets me down . went again last night and i ordered the sheep ' s milk ricotta . so so good . the pizzas and pastas are good as well . go , you won ' t be disappointed . 
i was so surprised when i saw leone ' s on kitchen nightmares . i have been going there for years and years and always thought the food was great ! the chicken balsamic and eggplant rollatine are two of my favorites . the service staff is always so personable ! 
its a decent place . not the best italian food i had , but it was good . i was here for restaurant week . i had the lobster ravioli , the meatball appetizer and the brownie dessert . it was all good , nothing stood out as the best thing i have eaten . it was pricey , but i wasn ' t disappointed . they have a good wine list to choose from . overall , if you are in the area i would give it a try . its not something i would trek a long way down to eat . 
i was excited to try this new tap house convenienlty located just two blocks from my work . we sat at the bar and had a nice open airy feeling with high ceilings , big windows looking to the outdoor patio with fire pits , and plenty of tv ' s to catch the world cup . i couldn ' t decide wich sandwich to order , and the bartender highly recommended the chicken pressed sandwich . it wasn ' t quite what i expected . instead of the standard grilled piece of chicken , it was more of a chicken mush , kind of like a crab cake consistancey but a little mushier , almost like tuna salad . it came with fresh cut fries and a pickle and was very filling . i know someone else mentioned the pickles were tasteless but i rather liked the mild pickle . it didn ' t have the overpowering flavor of vinegar that some pickles can have . we also had a burger with blue cheese and bacon which came with a side salad that could have used a little more flavor in the dressing . i had to salt it up quite a bit just to get some zing into it . the burger was ordered medium rare but came closer to medium . it still had great flavor which made up for the slightly overcooked meat . overall i really liked the atmosphere and would go back especially if they started having happy hour specials so i could try out more of their beer selection . i was actually surprised at how affordable the beer prices already are at full price ranging anywhere between N for most up to N for just a few choices . sitting outside drinking a beer in the fall with a fire pit burning looked very inviting . i will be back , and would really like to try the mussels but i ' ll be sure to leave room for dessert ! 
the food is always consistent . the service is always consistent . i do not frequent this place often but when in the area i do choose it over other restaurants serving similar types of food . the staff is attentive to each and every person at the table . always . i recommend this restaurant and will continue to eat here when in the neighborhood ! 
i really wanted to like this place . i ' ve been looking for a new local thai spot since yum yum bangkok expanded and ruined it ' s food in the process . went in at about N N on a saturday night , and it was pretty packed - although we didn ' t have to wait for a table ( no reservation ) . had corn eggroll things as an app . they were bland , had no flavor , and were basically disgusting . next course was the red chicken curry . the flavor was lacking and it had absolutely no spice . the only reason i was able to stomach it was because the vegetables were cooked very nicely , as they were still really crunchy . also , it had lots of veggies but barely any chicken . if they put half as much effort into their food as they did into decorating the place , then maybe i would have had a better review . oh yeah , and the " dj " came out from behind his stand and brought us our appetizer . that was a bit strange but made us laugh . 
today was our first visit to the restaurant . it was an interesting brunch experience . we came with my in-laws to celebrate my husbands birthday . overall , it is a rather intimate space . however , i was very surprised at how loud it got , because of one group of people . as far as the decore goes , there were several interesting prints and paintings along the walls . when we first entered we were asked if we had made a reservation . previous reviews on yelp suggested that wasn ' t strictly necessary . i guess i should have done it regardless . . . ? our waiter was very pleasant , although he seemed a bit nervous at one point . i say that , only because he accidentally spilled the small container of coffee creamer . he apologized and it was quickly cleaned up from the table . no real harm , no real foul . as for what we decided to order off of the brunch menu . . . . my mother in law ordered the carrot soup . her only significant comment is that she found it to peppery for her tastes . my father in law ordered the daily frittata special . provolone , mushroom , red peppers and served with an arugula salad on the side . his major comments include the eggs being too dry and the salad being too vinegary . my husband , the birthday boy , had the italian special . two poached eggs on italian bread served with riccot cheese and sopersata salami alongside home fries . he and i had iced coffee along with our meals the coffee was alright i guess . as for his meal , he only had a couple comments . the poached eggs were cooked differently from each other . one had a firm yoke while the other had a runny yoke . i explained that the soft yoke is how poached eggs are meant to be served . e made a half hearted effort at eating it with his hands , but the knife and fork are a must . i had the margarita pizza . thin as a cracker crust ! also huge for N serving . ( i ' d guess N " . ) stack three slices and you ' ll get the average thickness of one classic ny vendor slice . . . . maybe . aside from the N slices my hubby had , i easily downed the rest myself . tasty , but the amount of ( admittedly fresh ) basil on top was a joke . if they douse it in fresh basil next time , i ' ll be a lot happier . N ( - ) before tip for N people . they do take cards , but beware the costs . 
sunnyside is not the place where you would expect to find such amazing food , and yet salt fat in their short time here in the neighborhood has become the preeminent restaurant in the area for delicious and bold culinary adventures . their menu is constantly evolving , but you can always count on any dish to satisfy your taste buds . they operate as an a la carte experience which elevates the cost of the dining experience a bit , my only complaint , but you never regret parting with your money as the food is so delicious . the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is always pleasant . if you don ' t order the rice krispies with marshmallow ice cream , you are a fool , it ' s probably the best thing ever . 
love love love carmen ' s ! ! ! the pizza yum ! ! the subs yum ! ! ! really everything i ' ve ordered was great ! ! my family i order from carmen ' s weekly we are very happy satisfied ! ! we are big time carmen ' s pizza fans ! ! ! ! 
oh my . a good cocktail and good nosh ? yes . delightfully cramped uncomfortable on a saturday eve ? yes . bartenders that really know what they ' re doing and intimidate you with said knowledge ? yes . mayhap it ' s a little masochistic to come here as i feel infinitely not-cool-enough , but i still like it . love the changing menu . the flourless chocolate cake is was bomb . also the pan am cocktail . 
good cubano , plantain chips , empanadas , rum cuban ( french ) toast and iced cafe con leche with friendly service . good for kids , was not too busy on a saturday when everywhere else seems packed . super nice decor and open bar floor plan , seemed np accommodating several larger groups N-N pple and many young kids . stage with music some nights and projector for video , tv , world cup . 
uber ! ! ! ! ! ! i loveeeeeeeeeeeee this place . . . i live a few blocks away and just discovered it . . . i felt like a found a hidden treasure . the pizza is delicious , great toppings , inviting environment . i emailed all my ny contacts to let them know about it . i love you guys . muah julie
i have been here before and the food was good , but the service has always been subpar . last night i was craving some japanese bar food and being from the financial district where there isn ' t any , i decided to come here since it ' s close to where i ' m working . we got sat and received no menus for the first N minutes and no server came to greet us . i finally got the hostess ' s attention and she found us a menu , saying that they ' re low on menus . we decided on what to eat and sat waiting for our server to ask us for our drink and food order for another N minutes . i finally got the attention of a server and he came and took our order . we ordered a variety of food , including sashimi , squid , udon , tofu , clams , and some skewers . after he took our order , another group got sat next to us . the sashimi came after N or N minutes . the squid came after another N minutes after the sashimi . then nothing came after that . the other group in the meantime got all their dishes . they ordered after our sashimi came . i asked a server why our food was not coming out since our server was nowhere to be found . i was starving and we have already been waiting for N-N mintues . she went back to check and said some bs excuse like our food took longer to cook than the other group ' s . i asked her why our tofu and noodle took longer to cook than their tofu and noodle dishes . she couldn ' t give me a good answer . within N minutes of complaining , all our food came out . i think they forgot our order . i was starving and ate everything even though the food was okay , not great . i got very nauseous after eating the food . my boyfriend ' s stomach wasn ' t feeling very good either . i could only assume it ' s because the cooking of the food was rushed and the meat was undercooked . the grilled clams were pretty raw . i didn ' t wait N minutes to get served undercooked food . i was very disappointed and am never going back there . 
excellent exotic food a bit expensive but worth it
yes ! read the review in philly mag ' s ' best pizza ' issue and was stoked to find trios just beneath my radar up at girard and Nth . i ordered for takeout last night and got a piping-hot ' tomato pie ' ( which is trios ' shorthand for thin crust ) and couldn ' t have been happier . pros -excellent crust on the ' tomato pie . ' -comes in a square ! -fresh and hot -service - friendly , helpful dudes . cons -directtv in the waiting room was showing the cardinals reds game ? ! ? ! 
being from ny , i was skeptic trying this place out for late night craving . good thing it was open late and not crowded . ordered the paneer tikka kati rolls to go -- the order took about N minutes to get ready . given that there were two other people in the place , would have expected a little speedy preparation ( guess the nyer in me likes fast pace and service ) . the food was delicious - wrap did not seem to heavy and paneer was very moist and chewy . the green chutney inside was perfect blend and it did not have too many onions to leave that after smell in your mouth . the two sauces available on the side are white sauce and hot sauce . spicy alert for the hot sauce so please be careful . white sauce was great but a little thick in texture and hard to dip . i did not see any of those sauces in the actual rolls . i wish they had the extra green chutney also on the side . 
this was my second time eating at juniors . being right next to broadway makes it a great selection . walking in you may get the " oh god , another diner " feeling , but this food is anything but . on this occasion i had the all american - cheeseburger and fries . i love burgers and this one did not disappoint . they are huge , seasoned well . . . and these guys know how to cook meat medium ! my wife ate a grilled chicken salad , which she liked , how can you mess it up right ? the kids both had chicken fingers , which were not the processed , generic chicken fingers you find everywhere else . unfortunately , i did not have room for dessert ( although i did have a pretty good chocolate milkshake with my dinner ) . however , the desserts looked mouthwatering . just being here and reading the history made you feel like you were getting a great price of nyc culture . while our service wasn ' t that good ( he was more into the world cup going on at the time ) , we had great luck the first time around . make sure to take a look at all of the celebrity poster notes in the back bathroom hall . highly recommended , great variety of food . 
i really love this place ! the service is excellent and the food and sangria is delicious ! i ' ve never had a bad experience coming here . it ' s small and cozy and it ' s a great atmosphere all around . 
i have been coming to mcgillins for a while , this place is an old standby . i really enjoy the feeling in there , lots of fun , good music , people relaxing and having a great time . the food is ok , but the bar scene is great . ive had great times there and the service is also on point . i give mcgillins N stars and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time , and a few drinks . 
one of the best restaurants in philadelphia . the beet salad was a light and crisp start to the meal , while the seasonal soup warmed our chills with its deep earthy seasoning and grandmotherly-like soulful broth . the antipasti plate pleased every pallet from the non-culinary curious to the devout foodie , and the whipped ricotta ( with bread that had to have been shipped from the province country side ) was a crowd pleaser . my uovo pizza was incredibly comforting in that raw drippy egg yolk kind of way , and the closing act of the meal , the caramel budino , ended the afternoon with " mmmmm ' s " around the table . 
N stars for food ! N stars for atmosphere , but really just because of the size of the place . my favorites - the kani salad , the sansom roll ( easy on the sauce ) , and the N roll special . vic , la , and jim are the best . 
the place is very lovely , right across the park with large window . the servers were very helpful , and the food was great and reasonably priced . we had N appetizer , main dish for each , a bottle of wine and a dessert to share , the total bill was about N each . i would love to go back . we ( group of N ) went there for dinner on saturday around N pm , and it was already busy and we were told it would be N minutes wait . we left name and walked around , it was totally fine . 
we had an excellent ethiopian meal here last night . the dishes were deliciously flavored with rosemary and wonderfully prepared in all respects . a quaint and very casual , tiny place , a friendly and helpful owner . this restaurant is better than those that i raved about in washington dc , but definitely the best experience in philadelphia . loved it and i am already thinking about the next visit . 
pretty damn good , thank goodness this place opened up here . we usually order ( for pickup ) the N N chicken meal and pickup in N minutes . the hostess waitress is always courteous and polite and our order ready . we begin to eat and it seems we are racing each other to finish first , i know we shouldn ' t eat that way but it ' s so good you think it ' s going to disappear or go bad if you don ' t eat it quick enough . although the chicken meal is great , the anticuchos plate is phenomenal . i grew up in peru and that dish takes me back , amazing ! 
great ambiance , good food , regular drink specials , cool weekend night life hot spot . if you ' ve never been , go . it ' s great fun . i hope this place stays open for years and years . 
service sucks . we were seated in the bar , bar service was good . we were finally seated outdoors , we have been waiting for N fffff ' in minutes and nobody was even attending to us . we have been passed around different servers . the manager was incompetent . he didnt even apologized to us for being neglected . service sucks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
ah ' pizza that makes one feel good . 
boyfriend and i finally made it here over the weekend . we were the only people in the joint at Npm on a saturday for most of our stay , though a few patrons did wander in near the end to grab a drink at the bar . i have to give asb credit for putting down roots in this neighborhood and getting the ball rolling on its inevitable gentrification . the decor is unassuming and simple , but it works for the space . a lot of the original details of the building look like they were salvaged . the rotating drink menu is written on old chalkboards , which was a nice touch . they also have cider on draft , which was a redeeming quality for me . unfortunately , i was not wowed by the food . i had the mushroom seitan cheesesteak , and the bread was so hard it crumbled whenever i tried to pick it up , creating a lava flow of metled cheese and fake meat . i ended up going at it with a fork . the flavor combination was off for me , it was too overloaded with black pepper and jalepeno , the mushrooms and seitan had the same texture , which was unfortunate . boyfriend liked his pulled pork sandwich , and the fries we split were good , too . all in all i wouldn ' t make a special trip south of washington to come back here , but i probably will since boyfriend seemed more gung-ho about it . 
we decided to try this place out last night after having dinner at kraftwork nearby . waiting in line to be let in by the earpiece-wearing bouncer felt a little ridiculous , and i was a little nervous about the particularly douchey looking crowd . it felt a little too jersey shore for my taste . but once we got inside , i was totally pleasantly surprised . granted i ' ve never been to a beer garden before , so maybe this is what they ' re all like , but it was a really nice set up with tons of picnic-table style seating in the open air court . i didn ' t get anything to eat ( and the N soft pretzels seemed a little over the top ) , but the beer was very reasonable . i love the walk-up-window idea - it means no one rushes you out and you can sit for hours with your friends . i also liked that the bouncers seemed to be counting people as they went in to make sure it didn ' t get too crowded , which made for a much more pleasant experience . so overall this is a really unique spot , and i ' m hoping that once it ' s open for a little longer that the crowd will become more diverse , but i definitely recommend checking it out . 
one of the more reliable and stylish places downtown . rarely do you get a bad meal . part of the max empire that always seems to provide a quality experience . on a recent visit , i had a new yorker sushi roll , which included delicious seared new york steak and pieces of avocado in a traditional sushi roll presentation . dinner was seared tuna over wasabi mashed potatoes and a parmesan cream . delish . my friend had a shrimp cobb salad , which looked quite good , and also had the tuna sushi , i think , which he said was quite good . it ' s a busy , attractive place with a nice , downtown feel in a city that needs more downtown feel . 
the black label burger did not live up to the hype . i was expecting a insane sensation to my taste buds after the first bite but nothing . yeah it was good but no way worth N . save your money and go to shake shake or order the minetta burger for N . 
great chicken ! bad service ( waitress didn ' t visit us once ) and kind of dirty . there were even kids running around the dining area . but again , just about the best chicken i ' ve ever had ! 
we rolled in on a saturday night with a group of N and no reservation . the hostess said N minutes but managed to score us a spot before we could reach the bar and order a cocktail . the restaurant isn ' t huge , but the space fit our group nicely . not sure why , but i didn ' t feel like having a burger so i ordered the grilled cheese . gouda blend melted on a portuguese muffin and , of course , everything ' s better with bacon . my cohorts weren ' t thrilled with their blueberry pies and oreo cookie desserts , but my carrot cake delivered with satisfaction . i hear the westville in west village is better ( most things are ) , but i was perfectly pleased with westville chelsea . 
spent an amazing weekend up in valatie , ny stopped at hour time bar and grill at N route N . staff was great inviting , excellent service . food was excellent , beers served cold and refreshing . facility clean and comfortable to be in . they have everything your looking for in a great bar from otb , keno , lotto , darts , pool table , video games and a great juke box . very modern , had such a good time spent most of the late day and evening there . customers all seemed to be having a great time and very friendly . if you dont want to miss out on a great time this place is a must visit if your in town even worth the trip just for a fun time out . 
i ' m no sicilian pizza connoisseur , but on a recommendation from a friend , i was intrigued by her " you ' ve gotta go to l b ! " enthusiasm . on a day when i felt like going on a little adventure , my boyfriend and i drove N miles down to gravesend to try this pizza out . what can i say ? it was good , it was hot and tasty , and we definitely scarfed it down . N . N for a slice-- chewy soft crust , sweet sauce , minimal cheese . will i drive N miles in the near future to come here again ? nah . i ' d rather try somewhere else in the quest for something amazing . we also tried the rainbow spumoni- chocolate , vanilla and pistachio . it was nice-- a little icy , a little creamy , not cloyingly sweet . again , not out of this world , but definitely good . it ' s a pretty casual place , nice to sit outside in the summer . i gotta give them credit , though , for being open N years . wow ! 
after my daughter , who doesn ' t eat seafood , raved about the calamari at blue , i knew i had to give blue a try . i was delighted with the menu . the food was fantastic ! ! when i told them how my daughter had loved the calamari , they said although that was only on the dinner menu , they would kindly prepare it for myself and my friends . the waitstaff was terrific as well . . . . it all contributed to a wonderful dining experience . . . . . if you ' re ever on staten island , you must visit blue . you ' ll be pleasantly surprised ! 
okay food but bad service . i went there for lunch with couple of my girl friends for girls day out . the waitress was very rude since the beginning even when she was taking order . she was upset with everything we asked . in the end , she was very upset about the fact that we asked her to give the left overs . the food was okay but very bad service . 
intimate space with a sleek modern decor . perhaps a bit too dark . i ' m a big fan of jean georges other restaurants and finally decided to give perry st . a try . went with the crab salad and the snapper . both were fresh , simple and delicious . the desserts were mediocre , but all in all an excellent experience . 
i ' ve lived in montclair for a while now . this restaurant has the best turkish food around . it ' s a great place for parties , family dinner , and a great place to meet friends for lunch . the luch specials are fantastic , they give an enormous amount of food for just N . my favorite dishes are the stuffed cabbage , spinach stew , and chicken kebab , not to mention their soups are phenomenal and the staff is very kind and friendly . i always recommend this place to everyone ) 
first of all , i have a crepe obsession and had been craving crepes for months before deciding to finally give into the craving by trying out beau monde . i went there knowing it would be pricey ( thanks to yelp ! ) they successfully satisfied my crepe craving . i had the olive , feta , spinach savory crepe and the dulce de leche with bananas and toasted almonds for dessert . it was fabulous . my friends both devoured their nutella dessert crepes . we had a pleasant server who was helpful with suggestions ( in a friendly , non-pushy way . ) if i were to do it again , i would skip the wine to make the final bill more bearable . i ' m also debating just going there and ordering dessert crepes ( served in a wine glass ) at the bar . that would be swell . 
i am going to start by saying that the coffee they serve here is amazing . some of the best coffee anywhere in astoria . with that said , i will won ' t be going out of my way to eat here again . i was excited to finally try kickshaw after seeing various tv spots and from other reviewers . i walked in at about N N in the morning . i was not greeted , but asked the person behind the counter if i could sit anywhere . he responded by telling me that they won ' t serve food for another N mins . okay , so i can i sit anywhere i asked again and was told sure . i found a seat at the bar and after N minutes of being ignored , i waved down the counter person and asked if i could start with a cup of coffee . " okay , what do you want " was the response . being that this was my first time , i expected that the counter person would be a little more interested . i order my coffee and sat for another N minutes , by this time my stomach was not happy . i finally waved down the counter person again and asked when i would be a good time for me to order , that was when i was told that the chef would be not be in for another N to N minutes . finally the chef decides to come in and i order my sandwich which was delivered to me without even so much as an " enjoy " or " here is your food " . i ate my okay grilled cheese and drank my coffee . after waving the counter person down an third time , i asked for my check , paid and left , again without a word for any staff . speaking of staff , while i was sitting waiting for the late chef , one server decided that the counter would be a great place to get some sleep after explaining to the counter person that they had taken a xanex shortly before coming in to work . all in all , i ' ll stick to il bambino for my yummy grilled sandwiches . 
i had my doubts . but the place served some very good food . the service was excellent even though the place was busy . i recommend the lamb shish . 
a party of N for dinner on friday evening . we went because of the great reviews . nice decor and parking was not bad for a s philly location . we are all italian , four from the abruzzi region and three people in our party are fantastic italian cooks . for apps , we ordered the cheese plate , rice balls and breaded olives . the rice balls were just ok . i have had better home made with more rice stuffing , the olives were ok . do not order the cheese plate . you will be wasting your cash . the cost is N . N and we all laughed when the plate arrived . there were N-N one inch squares of different cheese . each square was no thicker than an eighth of an inch . three different ttypes of honey , three honey pecans and three pieces of bread . now we realize that this is not the main portion of our dinner but these cheese selections were so tiny that if one person ate them all with the bread , pecans and the honey , they would not be in any way full . the chicken baked under a brick is wonderful . the porchetta was very good . the rib eye was good , the monk fish was not good . way too much going on with this dish and the fish was a bit chewy . the chocolate ravioli stuffed with rabbit was just ok , the same with the lasagna . the server was not attentive at all . we had to ask repeatedly for olive oil for our bread . he never asked if anyone needed black pepper or cheese for the pasta dishes , which we had to ask for and at that time the restauart was not at all busy . for dessert we ordered chocolate almond cake , chocolate mousse and a pizza dessert . the almond cake was good . the mousse was a cold , stiff block of of hard chocolate ( left in the fridge too long or it was old ) and the pizza had too many things going on with it . bottom line , just an ok meal for a hyped restaurant . not aplace that i would return . 
finally hit up this much lauded pizza joint as a group of six . they gave us an hour wait time so we grabbed a drink at the pencil factory . it turned out to be less than an hour so i had to down my pint . they don ' t take resies nor do they take your number to call when your table is ready . the space isn ' t tiny and reminds me of a warehouse barn . communal tables galore with a tiny bar up front . we were seated at the back table with a good view of the pies getting kneaded , tossed and slid into the oven . we ordered siz pies and two salads ( both gates of edens ) . one pal was going vegan so had a salad to herself and the vegan with vegan sausage . had a taste of the faux meat and it was extra soy tasting . the non-vegans had - hellboy ( mike ' s hot honey ) - greenpointer ( my least fav , probs b c i like meat on my pizza ) - baconmarmalade picante ( my fav b c hello bacon and sweetness , but i felt was the soggiest of the pizzas ) - porkpie white ( was decent , but didn ' t wow me like the above ) and i forgot the last pizza we ordered . so my friend are pizza lovers and one by one said it was their fav . i ' m still faithful to difara and locali is a close second , but that baconmarmalade is dang good . my only criticism is the soggy middle though folding does help a little . there is also quite a bit of excess outer crust , which our neighbors left a plateful of . i ' m a carb lover so i killed mine , but even some of my paulie gee fans didn ' t finish . for shame , no ? one very bright spot is that paulie gee does indeed stop by to check in with each table . he was even chatting folks up while they were waiting . that ' s superb . the service overall is quick , fast and on point . also they have mexican coke . a buck more that regular . a splurge i took . 
average food . ( my fusilli with crabmeat was tasty but crab was not evident ) bad service . we were rushed . throughout the meal . there are too many other very good byob choices in phila . i would not go back or recommend this restaurant . . 
this pizza is amazing . it ' s pretty much a hole in the wall place , but even with long lines , they get the pizza out pretty quickly . definitely worth trying out . 
update N N ok , i stand corrected- it was the N . N fish tacos , and N . N for the burgers . i guess i just imagined the price hike . -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------- yikes , just went there for dinner last night--- i can ' t believe the prices , especially for these days . the quality of food was about the same , but there is a definate hike in some of the prices . N for a burger ? really ? is it organic or grass-fed , i can ' t see what justifies this price-- a small burger with a handful of stringing , greasy fries . . . after many years , i think i ' m done with this place
excellent meal at heidi ' s house ! my mom and i shared the bacon mac and cheese and an heirloom tomato with mozzarella salad from the special menu . both were to die for ! the best part about the mac and cheese was scraping the cooked cheese from the sides of the dish and eating it . the restaurant is small and cozy but the tables are well spaced enough that you don ' t feel cramped . i will be back to try more of the menu ( i have my eye on the paella next ) . 
noisy beyond description . go with a crowd and eat by yourself since you can ' t hear anyone . but man the pizza ' s are good . 
charming little bistro with excellent food and inventive drinks . the menu is limited but well-executed . we had delicious gnocchi that were light and flavorful . the hanger steak was also excellent . there were a number of tempting drinks on the menu . the chai with rye and condensed milk was a terrific substitute for dessert . there ' s a sweet courtyard garden -- wish it had been warm enough to sit under the stars . 
having eaten here a dozen times or so , food , service and hospitality is consistently excellent . great drinks , or a simple proseecco to start , warm delicious bread . then the tough part . what apps romain course . . pick any . no bad choices . i ' ve sampled my guests selections . i stick to the signature meal and simplicity of spaghetti done to perfection paired with a red barbera wine . enjoy any dessert with coffee , tea . then stroll around the block ( or back to gct ) we walk off dinner ! best part of our day in nyc
dessert tasted like rubbing alcohol . we brought it to manager ' s attention and he thought they were fine . left this restaurant feeling gross . i would not recommend . 
a lot of beers . many many many beers . if you like beer , come here . the mussels are great too . the burgers are thick and juicy but a bit awkward to eat . that doesn ' t stop me though . it can get packed . but there ' s an equally stuffed second floor . 
holy crap ! amazing ! the chef ' s tasting option was one of the best meals we ' ve ever had . once ordering , we were asked if we had any preferences , and of course , we just went for it . well , i ' m sorry , but i think we should have paid more for what we received . it was amazing . there was foie gras , lobster , the whole gamut of fine flavors and exquisite pairings . the food was wonderful , and the service was stellar as well . yes , it ' s not cheap . but the value is incredible , and i ' d go back again and again . 
you must shield yourself from the erroneous reviews for this restaurant . any human being giving this place less than a N or N must have confused this with another restaurant . this place was remarkable in every way . at first , we sat on the not-so-scenic side with the view of N . we asked if we could be on the river side and were taken over there with no problems . my fiance and i both ordered the lobster bisque and the chicken and gnocchi . the lobster bisque was phenomenal . it was thinner than most bisques i ' ve had which allowed for more flavors to come out , rather than be drowned out in a sea of heavy cream . the chicken was the tenderestestest meat that has ever graced this planet . it melts like butter in your mouth . it came with gnocchi , mustard greens , tomatoes , and chestnuts . all the flavors work together to make you forget all the times you were lonely and sad . to further the star rating , we were given free hummus and pumpernickel in addition to the rosemary bread and honey butter served . the service was friendly and welcoming . the prices were high but every penny was worth it due to the flavor of the food and the amount of food you get . 
i ' m going to keep this short and sweet . i am a sports fanatic . i ' ve traveled all over the country and i ' ve never found a better sports bar . now i may be slightly biased because i am a philadelphia sports fan but i really don ' t think that is the case . the crab fries are a must-have . leave your computer now and go try them if you haven ' t . if you haven ' t had them before you haven ' t lived . the crab legs are a seafood and garlic lovers dream . the chickie ' s cutlet italian always hits the spot for lunch or dinner . there are tvs everywhere and sports fans galore . this is where the real fans hang out and watch the games . the service is wicked fast ( yes i said wicked ) . i could go on forever but then i ' d be taking away precious time that you could be spending at chickie and pete ' s and i wouldn ' t want to do that . . . the only bad thing about chickies- you will usually have to wait for a table during peak times which happens to be when i go most often . 
sit in the bar section for the best food at the best prices . 
we went to tony lucille ' s with a party of N . each of us ordered a different entree . within a two hour period after finishing our meal , N of us began having stomach aches , and ultimately the inevitable . i called the restaurant and asked to speak with an owner or manager . i was told that i had reached their " answering service " ( i don ' t know of any restaurant with an answering service ) . i was asked the nature of my call . i explained that in our party of N , N of us had gotten physically ill , and that i wanted to convey that to the ownership or management , so that they can take corrective action . i made a point of telling the " answering service " that i was not looking for a free meal or a refund . i was told that i would receive a return call the next day . i never did receive that call . i can only feel that the owners of this establishment are not concerned when N out of N people get a stomach ache and diarrhea after eating at their restaurant . obviously , this issue is not a priority to them . my recommendation when patronizing this establishment . . . . . . bring some pepto-bismol . 
the pizza is consistently good and there are gluten free options . i think it ' s the best pizza in this part of vermont . in the summer lots of fresh local veggies used . as for the service , we usually order take out and it ' s always been done when they said -- so i can ' t comment on that . 
i had come here in november and thought the food was amazing , this time it failed to amaze me . the pasta i had was mildly cold , big disappointment being that i loved it the first time and had raved about it to other people . 
rating best really bad ambiance ( N ) it ' s a place where you would go for a romantic night out or meeting good friends to catch up or go solo to spoil yourself . food ( N ) i was just expecting better for the cost we are paying . the appetizer i ordered was pei mussels . some of the mussels were succulent while many were beyond scrawny . the entree was half griggstown " brick " chicken . it was suppose to have brown rice . i had a very creamy almost risotto rice . if it was brown rice , then they put too much liquid while cooking it . their half chicken was half a chicken breast and a filleted thigh . if you wanted a salad , it will set you back N for a very banal salad . N for a fancier salad such as a pear salad . sides would be an additional N . no wonder people ordered desserts afterwards . the waiters would hand you a new menu that only lists desserts which do not include the prices . that bothers me . i don ' t like that type of surprises . service ( N ) after i had my mussels , i went to the ladies room to wash my hands . when i came back , luckily i looked before i sat down and noticed there was spilled pernod fennel broth spilled on my seat . i was most annoyed and chose to sit at the other seat . when the waiter finally came over ( he disappeared a lot ) , i explained why i ' m in the other seat . he wiped up the chair and didn ' t move my silverware . i felt like he was expecting me to go back and sit in my original seat . for god sake , i ' m still at my table . i switched seats not tables . service just went downhill from there . timely manner for check after dinner he inquired about dessert . i said no because i felt just tired he asked if i want coffee to which i stated i ' d like just the check please . he disappeared again . he came out and checked on the other tables but still didn ' t get the check . he disappeared yet again . after a long while , he finally brings it over . i immediately put the charge card inside and wait . and wait . and wait . finally i am about to get up and just go to the register myself when he pops up and retrieves it . i ' m so done . not going back . failed to meet my expectations sadly . i was really looking forward to it too . oh well . next restaurant . 
went there once but i loved it . . . 
i eat here often with my coworkers and we get the fried pancake and ma la tang frequently . the fried pancake is a northeastern china specialty where they shred a regular scallion pancake and fry it up with vegetables and meat . since we are spice lovers , we get this dish with hot sauce , and ma la tang with medium spice . lately i feel that the dishes have gotten more oily so i haven ' t been eating it as much . but this restaurant is still a decent place for a bite to grab . ( don ' t expect too much from the decor ) 
oh my good gracious . . . the portions are ginormous ! went with a group of N expecting so-so italian food . let me tell ya , i came out of there happy and satisfied . like everyone ' s mentioned , it ' s family-style so portions are huge ! an order of fried calamari fed all N of us with a tad bit of leftovers . calamari was perfectly seasoned , not too greasy , just uberly tasty . the caesar salad was just like any other caesar salad - nothing too spectacular . for our entrees we ordered this seafood lobster pasta dish ( don ' t know what it ' s called exactly ) that had plenty of seafood throughout the dish . living in seattle , i know whether seafood is fresh or not and this was definitely fresh seafood . tried the veal dish which was tender and flavorful ! penne alla vodka . . . yuummmy . . . such a simple dish but great in size and flavor . thought we were too full to dig in but no one could have ' just one bite ' , let alone just one scoop . for desserts we ordered the tiramisu and cheesecake ( it may have been the shortcake ) . tiramisu would have been more than enough as it ' s presented in a pie-dish , or so it seemed . by then food coma had hit me and i just wanted to go home and sleep - but indeed , i tried both desserts which completed the meal in utter satisfaction . the only place i could compare this to is bucca di beppo ' s . and this by far , is tastier , has better ambiance and larger portions . my only gripe is the fact that there were only N stalls in the women ' s bathroom . such a small bathroom for a large establishment . ladies , prepare to stand in line . other than that , it was worth the N minute wait in the bar . ) 
we had reservations for new years they had a minimal menu which was fine but the prime rib was horrible . we were forced to take another plate because they would not take the portion off the bill for the prime rib . that will definately be the last time we go to this estabkisgment . . . 
i been here a few times along with the original blend . kayla is the most sweetest waitress ever . she is always sweet in a great mood . comes and checks on you very often . makes sure you are happy with drinks and food . service is always N . i look forward to blend atleast once a week . if you see kayla be happy she is not the waitress from hell ) 
very typical nj chinese take out . wont disappoint you , but wont wow you either . 
i have tried all the best neapolitan pizza in the ny ( franny ' s , roberta ' s , keste etc . . ) unfortunately , there is no real alternative to having that quality pizza lunchtime , without getting an entire pie . enter rubirosa . they offer about N of their varieties , by the slice , until Npm . i had a slice of the classic , very reasonably priced at N . N . the slice was excellent with a very crisp wafer crust and a proper blend of marinara sauce and cheese . a lot of the other spots tend to overwhelm the amazing sauce they have with a heavy does of cheese . while the pizza was delicious , it is not what earned a five star rating by this poster . i can unequivocally state that they have the best cheese calzone in nyc . stuffed to the brim inside a crispy delicious dough , is a melody of cheese that deserves to make it onto my last meal menu . 
i love mama ' s vegetarian so much that my real mom wonders sometimes . . this is the best pita stuffed fried chickpeas , hummus , and veggies everr . the veggies assortment they put in this falafel is delishhhh . you ' ll forget all about meat after one bite of this delicious falafel . mmmmmmm . . . . sooooo good . why ? because , for me , a good falafel should be light , with a little crunch on the outside , but soft on the inside . it should not be greasy . mama ' s is all this . essentially , the perfect falafel . cheap price . fast and friendly service . this place is awesome . 
we went to see fire grill for our cheat meal during the training that my boyfriend and i are currently doing . we had seafood sampler as an appertizer - delicious and fresh ! i had crab meat stuffed lobster for my main course - absolutely amazing ! crab meat was soft and perfectly cooked . they only had N pounds lobsters , it was way too much for one person . my bf had lamp chops for his meal - perfection ! ! we ordered risotto as a side it was good but not the best that i had . and then we had the time of our lives having chocolate lava cake and apple upside down with cinnamon ice cream . absolutely stunning ! we loved every minute . the service and atmosphere were great as well ! i would definitely come back . 
atmosphere it ' s fine , albeit dim and loud . it was a friday night , though food appetizer was meh ( potatoes with cheese sauce ) , entrees were good , served hot and portions were definitely healthy , flavor was good . service not good . server was pretty slow and unorganized . when we asked for water , as any restaurant will provide when asked , she brought bottled water . we mentioned that just regular tap water is fine , she declined to take back the bottled stuff . we even asked if we could replace it with another beverage , one that was more expensive . her response was something like " once i bring it to you , i can ' t take it back " . strange , no ? she also seemed irritated when asked about menu items . that , of course , set the tone for the evening ' s dinner out . i realize , however , that any place can have an off night regarding service or food . with many other peruvian options in the area with the same level of cuisine , but with a warmer and friendly type of service , well . . . that ' s where we ' ll be headed next time . 
just went for lunch . great wood oven pizza , it is worth a drive . the flavor of the crust is great and the salad was delicious . service was good . 
do not believe the hype about this one . had reservations for two with my girlfriend and we had heard such great things about this place and were so eager to try it finally . to find this place is a tad tricky as you do have to enter an alleyway you would typically not enter unless you knew there was a restaurant at the end . as we entered i noticed that the place does have a nice wooden like finish throughout the interior with a fair amount of candles throughout that provides a nice ambiance . however the place does not comfortably accommodate all of its guests because literally you can ' t even move your arms around without bumping into someone or something . now our waiter was extremely nice . overall our service time was great but it really is in the food that really disappointed me considering we were waiting for months to try this local " hidden gem " as it is called by many though i will not agree with that particular claim . for starters we got the spinach artichoke dip with the toast and my god this was the best spinach artichoke dip that i have ever had anywhere up until this point . hot , cheesy and an absolute delight to have . by the way i shall mention if you love wine then you have come to the right place as they have a great selection of fine wines . you also do have a selection of your expected liquors as well as a small choice of imported european beers . my wine personally was great with a hint of a fruity essence . to continue our meals we each ordered the chicken breast and the kale salad and just to make clear we both had the same opinion on these two entrees salads . kale salad was absolutely not even near worth the price considering the quantity of kale . chicken breast came out warm not hot which is good for first bite but quickly got cold . also it was supposed to be a boneless breast so why did i have a non edible portion of breast that was roughly N N the size of the chicken ? the actual chicken meat was good however i just became so dissatisfied considering how high the expectations are and for N Nth of the chicken to not even be able to be eaten is ridiculous . brownie dessert was how you . would expect . so in overall there are certainly positives about . the restaurant to be taken and i truly did want to love it but it lost major points on the entrees and salads . also if you come here don ' t bother asking for spring water just get the tap and save money . they give you a glass bottle of water that suspiciously is already opened by the time the waiter drops it off . now to pay N for a glass bottle of " spring water " and to not be able to open the . bottle yourself to confirm you are getting the product is also plain dumb and disheartening because for all you know you are probably paying for tap water under the false name of spring water . well thats . all thanks for reading and please remember i am simply one opinion . thank you
well , went to modo mio last night . . . and that ' s something for me , to go somewhere that ' s not going to have a burger to fall back onto . we wanted to have the escargot , but the menu on the website wasn ' t updated , so they didn ' t have them . i had instead the sformato , which was a little cloud of riccotta with lump crab meat , and it was delish . my companion had what appeared to be a salad with some shreaded pork in it . . . not quite sure what it was , but it was good . for the pasta course , we tried the cavatelli , with some peppers and maybe an anchovy , i really couldn ' t tell what was in there , but it was really good . i had the rabbit ravioli , and having never tasted rabbit , that was a big deal for me . it tasted strangely enough like some kind of sausage to me , but it could have been the sage . . . it was good , the pasta itself was beautiful , light and airy . . . i had the veal for an entree , ( had intended on having the crispy duck breast , but it wasn ' t on the menu , only a duck leg , so i passed on the duck ) . . . the veal was magnificent . veal is one of my favorites anyway , but this was really spectacular . if i was forced to find fault , the only thing i could think of was a little too much pancetta on it , so that its salty smoky taste almost overtook the delicate veal . . . but it was great . we also ordered the ribeye steak , and i don ' t have any idea what was going on in that dish , but it was also excellent . a square of flourless chocolate cake , ( great ) and a kind of fig tartlet , or something similar were had for dessert . the cake was also very good , and the only complaint about the fig thing was the crust was so hard you couldn ' t break it with a fork . . . we scooped out the insides and loved it . the kitchen also sent our a nice amuse bouche when we got there , with some gorgonzola , walnuts and figs on bread , that was also very , very good . the food has so much going on , so many different ingredients , that i ' m really not sure exactly what everything had with it , but it was very , very good . i recommend the turista menu , where for N you get to select one of each of the three courses , with plates the same size as if you ordered ala carte . . . big enough , but not too much . . . total bill was N . N with dessert and coffee after , and it was worth every single penny . the place really isn ' t too big , and the only down side i found was the noise level was very high . you ' re also packed in there pretty good , so with fellow diners so close to you , you don ' t want to really shout your conversation across the table . . . but the food was good enough , that i can overlook that . 
cozy atmosphere , great brunch food , and best of all is the service . while we were waiting in the formidable line , the owner himself came out twice with fresh-baked pancakes and french fries for all of us people waiting in the cold ! 
love thai thanks
have mixed feelings about this place . the space is great , very homely yet not too rustic , just the perfect blend to make one feel comftable . the food thou , is another thing . knowing this cuisine , it ' s just outright lying , calling menu items what they are . i ordered hummus masabacha , and after thousands of those in the past , all around the world , this is not a hummus masabach . it was tasty , just not hummus . this also goes for the shakshuka other people in my table ordered , or the fatush . it wasnt a veriation of the plate , just something very different . i felt disappointed
great place to go my son loves it there
what a great location , what a great crowd and team , i love this joint , is simple is cute and N hours can go by while you sip a few drinks and have a great girl chat . very nice
i ' ve been looking for delicious healthy since i become a healthy person . this is the place we looked up from yelp on the way to chelsea market . i will visit the market quiet frequently , but i never notice this great lil place . we were party of two , no reservation just walk in . there are just few tables , so we waiting for approximately Nmins , not a long wait . the waitress greeting with nice smile which i feel comfortable . when we sat down , we had out menu and asking for the recommendations . actually , i know what i am going to order but just wanna hear from them . what we ordered here was a chicken pot pie and a salad . the chicken pot pie was delightful for me , i thought it ' s gonna be good for share . next time i will go with two chicken pot pie , i mean one for each ( my friend ) it ' s absolutely fresh tasty . and it comes with salad , well nutritions . the waitress was really really honest and nice . she gave us true recommendation , since some of the waitstaff they are just speak nonsense . N star for service N for the cozy environment N for organic delicious food
the location of this restaurant is fantastic . it ' s actually on an old ship , which the restaurant is named after . the ship is a large sailboat since the late Nth century and was used to transport grain , coal and lumber . recently , it was bought and converted into a restaurant and was well-restored . the interior decor is very classy and fits the theme of the ship in general . i don ' t recall formal attire being required . we went for lunch there , so maybe that " rule " was for dinner . the place was empty when we went , so they probably didn ' t care . the service was prompt , every seat had a good view . it ' s adjacent to the uss olympia . it ' s a great convenient tourist lunch stop if you ' re visiting philadelphia and visiting the submarine and olympia just N ' north of the moshulu . the view is cool , but somewhat industrialized , since you get a grand view of camden , new jersey and the uss new jersey battleship across the delaware river . you can also see the i-N us-N benjamin franklin bridge to the north . the food was excellent . it ' s been a year since i ' ve eaten there , but i ordered a conventional hamburger . their menu was wide and extensive and was generally focused more towards seafood . 
the food here is awesome . the service is a bit crazy , but just flag them down . i definitely would recommend this to my friends family . N for all you can eat sushi kitchen food kick-ass ! 
what ' s with all the hype about this place ? when you come in it looks like a dingy , dirty hole in the wall . it doesn ' t look like it ' s regularly cleaned at all . not to mention that when the street people in new haven look better dressed and more professional than the waitresses at a restaurant , you know you ' re going to have a problem . i had a hard time believing my waitress even worked here when she came up to take our order without even greeting us . i thought i was getting " punked " at first . she was grumpy and dragging her feet the whole time like someone who just woke up from a all night bender . the food itself was average at best , nothing that would justify the wait by any means , and the fact that they can ' t take a debit or credit card strikes me as very backwards thinking ( which seems to be the motto of this place given the decor ) . i ' m pretty sure i ' m never coming back here again . 
such a disappointment . i ' ve eaten at the marathon at Nth and walnut a few times ( always good food and service , though a bit overpriced ) and was expecting a similar experience here . unfortunately , i am not even able to review the food because the service was so awful that my guests and i left before we even ordered . we were seated right away and provided menus on a saturday evening the place was surprisingly empty ( including the outside seating , i ' d say it was N N full ) . despite the relatively few tables , my guests and i waited over N minutes just for our water - and we only got that after we flagged down a waiter who was refilling another table ' s glasses . having already neatly filed our menus away ( clearly sending the message of " we ' re ready to order " ) we waited another N-N minutes without service , although we did notice the speed in which unused tables were being set and readied . again , we flagged down someone ( this time the host ) and said we have been waiting over N minutes and no one ' s come to take our order . he apologized and quickly took drink orders . our drinks were quickly served ( just N diet coke N iced tea ) by someone we believe was a manager ( compared to the wait staff hosts , she was dressed in more ' business ' attire suit jacket , etc ) . we thanked her for the drinks and again mentioned that we were still waiting to order . again , another apology and a promise that someone would be right with us . once we were nearly done our drinks and had still not given our order , we decided to leave . when i asked for the check , explaining that we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave because of the poor service , they apologized again and said the drinks ( N diet coke , N iced tea ) would be on the house . the phrase " it ' s the least they could do " seems beyond appropriate . 
beautiful place . supper large portions ! great food , and service . 
went during dining days . i had looked up the menu on the dining days website and was excited about the options . when we got there , the menu was much different with less choices . the appetizers were only gazpacho or salad . the entree was duck or scallops and the dessert was lemon curd . i chose marigold kitchen based on all the reviews raving about the amuses-bouches and was really excited to try these innovative bites . we kept waiting for them to come , and i was very disappointed that we didn ' t ever receive any . from the other reviews , it seems as though that sets this restaurant apart , and it was sad to not taste any . that being said , the gazpacho was excellent and had huge , delicious shrimp with it . the duck was cooked perfectly . the polenta that it came with was such a tiny amount , but tasted wonderful . the lemon curd dessert was scrumptious ! all the ingredients tasted very fresh . again , just disappointed by the different menu than what was advertised and by the absence of amuse bouche . 
the service we received while dining at this french bistro is comparably better than most places we ' ve eaten in the city . the food was meticulously prepared and very tasty . looking forward to coming back soon . 
food was okay . . the homemade noodle and satay padang was my favorite . service was bad , and when i ordered take out they didn ' t care what the customer ask , i was ask to separate the bean sprout from the soto they said they did already but actually they not . . . don ' t bother to go there . 
ahh yeah . 
this restaurant is quite small and has very little seating . i feel the dining area is quite dirty while the lady waitress is yelling past my ears . nevertheless , the food is great for its price . i had the hand- pulled noodle w beef in hot spicy soup which is pretty darn spicy . the noodles had a gooey texture , yet it tastes fresh . the beef and soup is- meh- alright . but , hey , we ' re here for the fresh noodles made on site . the dumplings are the best thing they have here . it ' s juicy and it ' s delicious . this is definitely a must- have . 
awesome date spot . great food , just the right noise level , great music and excellent service . not cheap but not ridiculously expensive . my favorite was the s ' mores dessert with whiskey wood smoke . it ' s pretty great . comes in a jar with smoke in it , smells just like an open fire . steak was also good , brussels , fries and beet salad was very good too . also the bathrooms are awesome . check them out downstairs . 
consistently fabulous . try the tilapia and the cream puff desserts . 
this place is a little hidden gem that i came upon , from the outside its not someplace you would think had the best damn hot dog i ' ve ever had ! it looks like a old regular biker bar , small menu , in which you order from the counter . we took a seat in the huge backyard and waiting for what so many raved about . . . the piled pork and sweet potato fries . when the food came out and it first hit me mouth . . . oh my god delicious ! the pulled pork you have to add your own bbq sauce , which is fine with me , i ' m a dipper . it was very flavorful ! one of the best i ' ve had . the sweet potato fries came with a sauce , mayo based which was awesome . but . . . the best part of my entire lunch was the hotdog ! yeah a hotdog , who would have ever thought a dog can taste so good . it ' s wrapped in a perfect crispy back with melted cheese , and oh so juicy inside ! the staff was also very friendly and i will be coming back ! especially for the dirty dog ! 
way to go daddy ' s pizza ! ! you have relocated to a better area , and inside is beautiful ! you have all created a nice , comfortable place to sit and dine . people enjoy sitting down and being waited on , which you now are doing and i believe this will help keep your business booming ! ! before i end , i ' d also like to add in that your prices are fair and reasonable . thank you for allowing the community to have a nice place to sit and have a delicious meal wothout breaking our pockets at the same time . best wishes to you ! ! 
this place is absolutely terrible and racist . the manager and the assistant manager both refused to serve us because " our kind " was not welcomed at the establishment . we were kicked out forcibly and embarrassed . i am surprised such an establishment even exists in the north east . i was very appalled . 
been to this place a couple times , great service and great food . just dont expect the cheap pricing just because its in Nave brooklyn . loves how helpful the waitresses were , and the environment is great there . 
love this place ! the black sesame creme brulee is to die for , i loved the salmon toast as well , and the staff is friendly . 
be prepared for philipino food and that means fried . but that said , it was delicious . i never thought i would say this , but i enjoyed the fried spam tremendously . the sizzling sisig was delicious ! also loved the prawns . the kare kare ( braised oxtail ) was good but missed a little something . could have added a bit of salt and or spice . overall loved the cocktails and the service . great place . 
disclaimer i came here with the momo brothers so i did not see the menu before or during the meal . that being said , i trust that i had what they deemed to be among the more delicious choices . to star , a board of prosciutto , olives , cashews , and brie appeared with a bottle of pinot grig . onto grilled little neck clams and the roasted baby beet salad . then arctic char in a bed of spinach accompanied by the goat cheese lentil greens flatbread and the ricotta green prosciutto flatbread and a bottle of pinot noir . dessert was an assortment of cakes , mousses , and pies . decadent . everything tasted light and fresh and so delicately seasoned . i love the farm to table concept that they ' ve taken quite literally ( they source their vegs at their farm down the road ) and the service was phenomenal - one sip of wine beckoned a server to re-fill . in the future , i would definitely try the pasta dishes , the sea scallops , and the duck leg confit . . . well done , i hope to have the opportunity to spend more time in momo terra . 
cheese bread is my favorite ball . 
the deal the yalies get . . midnight miya ' s . . N bucks for N pieces of different assortment rolls that the chef ' s choose each night for us i dont even remember them all ! ! they all had such unique fillings as i have never encountered for sushi that i couldn ' t keep up when the waiter described them . . i do remember one w asparagus . . and one with brie cheese . . one with shrimp . . some didn ' t even have fish in it . which was odd . . the rice on a few of the rolls were dry and hard . . but i guess taste wise was not bad my friend ' s favorite sake to get is the chinese firecracker but this drink is hot n spicy . . she loves it because she loves mexican candies . . but . . i could not handle the heat ! ! i had to make her drink the rest of my drink ! ! if it werent for the next event i would probably give this place a N . . but at the end of our meal another waiter brought us a beautifully crafted plate of albacore sashimi crafted into a rose ! ! we didn ' t understand why they gave it to us because we didn ' t order it . . but apparently the sushi chefs thought my friend was beautiful so free sashimi ! ! 
my family stopped in for lunch . just saw it driving by . very glad we did . pizzas excellent . liked that we could buy it by the slice . the italian dishes on the menu looked good , and the arancini did not disappoint-very good . we ate in , and were very glad we did . owners friendly , service great . when we are in the area again , will definitely go back . 
i ' ve been to five guys , in n out , elevation , etc . shake shack has the best burger for the juiciness , temperature , and texture you feel in your mouth . i ' m actually thinking of applying a job there to just to find out how they can make it . 
the food here is good . i like their margherita pizza . i would ' ve given them a better rating if they had not try to scam me . i held an event here and they overcharged me by N . i looked at the bill to see if i was charge for anything extra but the items on the check were correct so i assumed the total was correct . however , i did the actual math afterwards and noticed the total did not match the items that were added up . i called the restaurant to inquire about the incorrect total and to see if there was something extra they added but did not write down on the check . they took down my number and said the manager will call back . days went by and no one called . i contacted them again and again but was given the run around . the person i needed to speak to was either on break or on vacation . i finally got a hold of someone who asked me to call back after they review the tab . i called back a day later and she gave me the total i was charged but didn ' t explain what items added up to that amount . i had to call back another day for them to pull up the tab again . then she told me the total was correct . i said no it ' s not because we were charged per head , so that plus tax and tip does not equal to what i was charged . she took out a calculator and i had to help her do the math . finally she said " ok so N extra i can give you a gift certificate for that amount but i ' m only here on certain days and times " i was annoyed , not only did they blatantly tried to avoid the " mistake " they made , no apology was given , instead i was offered a gift certificate i can only come pick up during some magical hours that she was there . i was polite the entire time and not once did i complain until now . so people , if you have a large party , make sure you add up the items one by one to see if it matches the total . because apparently they have a hard time adding even with a calculator . 
great burritos , good price and the burritos are very filling . . . nice place to go if you enjoy mexican cuisine . 
i ' ve eaten the eggs florentine and the vanilla infused french toast . the florentine was bland and flavorless ( although the potatoes it comes with were not bad ) . the french toast was soggy , not particularly tasteful , and there was no " vanilla infusion " to be tasted . the syrup was mediocre . i think this restaurant has been overrated i am sorry that i went there on yelp ! ' s recommendation . i would not go again or recommend it to a friend . 
i ' ve been going there for N years ( i guess i ' m one of the " old and ugly " men referred to by another reviewer ) , and i have never seen the owner accost anyone . visiting a " dump " N or N different times might lead a reader to question why that other reviewer kept returning . the food is good , the drinks generous and reasonably priced , the staff almost unfailingly pleasant and friendly , and the owner prone more to tolerate untoward behavior than to react with violence . ( i wonder what the other reviewer and his friend were actually doing in the men ' s room . . . . ) by the way , i ' ve sometimes wandered in on a thursday night after N pm , and it is amazing how many N- and N-something guys show up ! visit N york street and decide for yourself , but don ' t be guided by the ranting of a person whose grip on reality seems tenuous . i won ' t ascribe any motives to the previous reviewer ' s writing its tone and lack of basis in fact speak for themselves . 
amazing chili paneer ! ! i go here just for that ! ! 
it was the first time to go to this restaurant after reading the good review . the place looked very nice with outside seating and there are so many to choose on the menu . i order a whole crab meat for the appetizer . it came in soft shell which is so hard to chow ( i wasn ' t sure if it was eatable ) and there were so little crab meat to eat inside . it was supposed to be today ' special but such a disappointment . . . then i ordered a linguine with clam in white sauce . very firs bite i bit sand . . . . okay . it happens so i kept going . i love seafood and i know what the fresh seafood taste like . the chopped clam ( a lot of it ) on top was not fresh ( tasted like a dead clam from a frozen bag or a can ) , sauce taste nothing . i put little bit salt and it was better . they put just five clams in shell on the side and it was only eatable clams ( it was very good but so small and again only five tiny ones ) on the plate . i would prefer more fresh clams in shells than bunch of dead chopped clams in my favorite dish . the worst was the waitress . argie . you are the worst waitress ever . you looked the empty glass of ice tea on our table when you passed by so many times to serve , pay attention to other customers who looks like regulars , have chit chat with other waitress but never came to us to offer another drink or refill . . . . bus boy did a great job than you did , argie . if the issue was only food i would have come back but i would never go back to the place where i receive the worst of worst service . my boyfriend order buffalo sauce with chicken for the appetizer and steak for main dish which he said was great . if you will have steak there , i think you will enjoy . good luck with argie . 
located in carroll garden , the residential area , which is beautiful and peaceful . we got lucky today with the restaurant not being crowded today . when you walk in , it ' s a bit dark with candles at the wooden table and at where they make the pies , but has an intimate setting and like you ' ve been brought back to europe ( somewhere ) . you can see them making your pie as you order . oh yeah , no menu when you sit . actually , the menu is on a small blackboard outside by the door - straightforward menu . only choices , large pie or calzone , toppings sausage , onion , artichoke , mushroom and i think one more . cash bases only and byob . onto the pizza , thin crust with fresh mozzarella which is so nice and crispy and not soggy . yes , it is a bit expensive , but you are getting quality pie . the greatest part is seeing them make the pizza as you order and eat your pie . everything is so fresh , from the dough to the homemade marinara sauce used on the pie , to the homemade mozzarella . we ordered two pies - first pie was devoured by my husband with me eating N . N slice and second pie for dinner the next day , but he had to eat one more slices on the way home cause he couldn ' t get enough . . . . i know rt , what a pig and he ' s not even big , just his stomach is huge . i really loved their setup in the restaurant . brick exposed , open kitchen , seats about N people at a time . they are open N hrs a day , only for dinner . . . they ' re that good that they don ' t need to be open all day . they take reservations on the day of , but not N-N hrs ahead . suggestion , call at exactly the time they open up - Np . you ' ll love this place . apparently my husband ' s stomach and taste bud does because we ordered another pie before we left the place . c u all there , we are waiting for the outside seating to open , which will be refreshing . 
terrible food , worse service , this restaurant won ' t be around long waited nearly an hour for first dish to arrive , then had to send it back because it was cold . don ' t be fooled by the cheery looking decor , koreander is a definite miss . plenty of great places to eat in montclair . this will never be one of them . 
sushi here omg you don ' t go to sushi yasuda for your trendy chic rolls , you come for the fresh tasty sashimi and sushi you cannot get anywhere else ! as explained in the menu and website , this restaurant is all about appreciating and honoring the traditions of eating sushi . the service and ordering are efficient but at times odd as they seem to be observing you eat the sushi properly op any pieces you order here are going to be amazing but also great was the black miso cod appetizer we had ( though may have been a special of the night kind of thing ) . everything from the decor design of the restaurant to making confirming your reservation ( highly recommended ) to the food and service can only be described as high quality and thoughtful . you are guaranteed to have a great sushi experience here ! 
can ' t make comment on any if the food but if you ' re on the hunt for coffee then i probably wouldn ' t bother . the gentleman who served us wasn ' t exactly friendly but it wasn ' t poor service either . back to the coffee - percolated coffee plus a bit of milk doesn ' t equal a latte . i had begun to think that it was just how things were in new york but have since found plenty of places who know how to make it right . 
i ' m an agoraphobe and a coulrophobe so i usually get take out , but man the food is slammin ' more slam than onyx in N . way too many hipsters in this joint which is when the coulrophobia kicks in . if there ' s more than two hipsters the agoraphobia kicks in . double trouble ! ! ! i usually get my styrofoam ozone box and run out the door before the zombie trustafarian hipsters chomp on my neck or steal my foam . the food is really good though and worth the harassing hipsters who smell like sewer grease . 
i don ' t know why i haven ' t written a review for this place yet , especially seeing as this place is our go to place any night of the week . reviews are saying that their menu is boring which i find incredibly funny since this is probably the most creative and delicious menu in a N mile radius . having moved to connecticut almost a year ago from washington , dc i have been so disappointed with the number of good restaurants in the area . park central is a comfortable place to grab a great dinner and drinks with friends . the atmosphere is great for N-N people , their bartenders are always so friendly and are willing to help you find a drink to satisfy . they have a fairly good selection of beers as well . plus the servers are very respectful and attentive which i appreciate . give park central a try ! 
there ' s a very pleasant atmosphere to dos toros . the burritos are very good . the guac ! you have to try the guacamole . the steak burrito is my personal favorite . a bit too spicy at times , but usually the burritos never disappoint . a steak burrito with a ' rona hits the spot like no other ! also you can see a lot of famous people in there . it ' s a happening joint . everyone from billy connelly to judas friedlander , it ' s a great place to eat . the service is also very friendly . there ' s a man with a beard that i always see who chortles at my jokes and is incredibly pleasant . 
a couple of my friends and i came in for brunch . we started with the three mazettim and chose the hummus , smoked eggplant , and spicy feta ( i think the spicy feta was my favorite ) . they were all good , except the bread-to-dip ratio was too small ( and so a star comes off ) . the three mazettim only came out with one flatbread , when sliced up only came out to about N-N pieces per person . i think they should have given at least a few pieces of pita bread , because unless you are going to start shoveling the hummus into your mouth with a spoon , it just goes uneaten . for the main , we decided to give the shakshouka a try . i had the green shakshouka , which i would highly recommend . it had all the right balance of flavors . mine was perfectly cooked , but the eggs in my friend ' s dish came out pretty raw . . . the whites were still uncooked . thankfully , they brought it back to the kitchen and cooked it a bit more . the inside is nice--it has an upscale feel without the requisite upscale price . i ' d probably come again if i need something to mix up the usual brunch food . 
 N for an omelet and coffee . look , i know it ' s nassau street , but that ' s just greed . 
i live down the block and came here because the chalk board said dollar oysters but the cook said it wont be available for another month ! you have to order the food directly with the cook and pick it up yourself . bartender wasn ' t the happiest person that day . pretty decent happy hour prices for drinks . nice decor . pretty nice backyard , weather permitting . good beer on tap selection . def . try the fried clam sandwich . loaded with fried clams for ( N ? ) . 
way more expensive than other bbq pits . on average for a half rib and half chicken combo other bbq pits charge N no tax , but algarve charges N . N plus tax , for what it seems is less food . yellow rice had no vegetables in it unlike any other bbq pit . if you in the area go to pepes bbq west orange they offer more for less money . 
food was great . but , very pricy . cannot go there in the winter . the main door opens in the dining area . as soon as somebody comes in , cold wind blows in . too many chairs cramped in a small place . food is definitely good . but the overall experience is not enjoyable . good place for takeout . 
excellent service , had a pizza delivered to my bf for valentines day in the shape of a heart all by phone ! excellent , accommodating and tastes amazing ! 
yummy little sandwiches with plenty of choices to choose from . the sample menu helps with good selections if you do not want to go through the N choices . lot of vegetarian options . sangria was good , refreshing and cheap , although i have tasted better ones . i tried also the dessert options and they were absolutely delicious ! ! ! nice space with tables outside . i went there in the winter so i wonder if the tent roof will be opened in the summer . 
he ' s the ' king ' for a reason . . . kiss the rings beeyotch ! freddy ' s junior is the way to go . if that platter does not fill you up , you ' re just a greedy mothaf . . . the falafel sandwiches or platters are awesome . it ' s not just filler . whoever makes these fried critters knows how to season them . even the shawarma is off the hook . it ' s just meaty goodness . i want to be put on that spit between all those layers of lamb and beef . lynch my ass on that bad-boy and let the women taste the drippings off my toes . . . best food truck in queens . period ! bar none . get it ? go get it ! 
sat at the bar here with my man and really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place . everything they say about the burger is true its that good . bar person was excellent as were the drinks . a bit pricey but worth it . 
came here for sunday brunch and i experienced a fairy tale brunch experience . i actually came here a while ago and was told that we would have to wait N . N hours for a table of two for saturday brunch . there were so many people outside waiting . we passed and went elsewhere . this time , i made a reservation on opentable . do it ! don ' t wait hours outside ! they called the day before to confirm the reservation . when i went in , i had to wait N-N minutes for the table to be ready bit i didn ' t mind because it ' s much better than the wait without a reservation . the waitress was really nice and friendly . she provided a bottle of tap water for the table and took our cocktail orders . if you don ' t want the taste of alcohol in the morning afternoon , i highly recommend the passion screwdriver . it ' s delicious ! i ordered the benedict johnny which is a great plate . the highlight of the plate was the potatoes . well seasoned and so yummy . i didn ' t care for the corn pancakes because it was too soggy from the runny egg when i finally got to it . i also tried the vanilla bean french toast which was good , but i wouldn ' t recommend it for one person to consumer . it is a lot of toast ! get it as a side for your whole party . when we got the bill , they gave us a survey card and a postcard ( cute ! ) . the ambience here is great and very comfortable . hard to describe but it ' s perfect to catch up with friends while eating great food . 
i ' ve never found a sushi restaurant that offers different chirashi dishes , which seem to be their specialty . i ordered the fisherman ' s bowl , it ' s as awesome as it looks bonus is they use real crab meat . no alcohol served but i over heard the owner say byob is allowed . i ' m really excited this place is in crown heights . look forward to coming again ! 
rly disappointing . . . pork rillette was my fav thing . prawns weren ' t bad but i wouldnt get them again . fries were good . . . pretzels were ok . . . watercress asparagus salad was a total waste of money . the chocolate-covered bacon sundae that sounds phenomenal was the most disappointing dessert i ' ve ever had . . . the soft serve tasted like nothing , pretzels tasted like croutons , choc . covered bacon was chewy instead of crispy . . . but the pistachio meringata was good . our desserts took just under N minutes we received a half-ass apology from our server . . . who was honestly the worst one i ' ve ever had . . . i mean unforgivably bad . i ' ve never seen anyone show how much they don ' t care . on the way out i noticed there were about N tables so they werent slammed or anything . i wouldnt go back . i wish there was a " nothing " check-box where it says " good for " in the additional tips on this business . 
this place is very chic and classic . the view is exceptional . everyone ' s uniform is so laid back . it ' s not a typical restaurant . my only problem was the menu really , i had to google translate some things because the waiter didn ' t bother to explain . maybe it ' s because i don ' t visit places like this often , but other than that the good was delicious . 
the food here is pretty tasty , in that " modern american " type of cooking . i actually have no specific idea what " modern american " means . i just call it that whenever i know it ' s western , but not definitively italian , french , or spanish . the decor and the ambience here is great for an intimate date , and the food is pretty good , too . i have tried both dinner and brunch here , and both experiences have been great . also , check out that bloody mary bar during brunch . on it laid numerous ingredients for making a bloody mary yourself , in just the way that you like it . 
the gyros make you feel like your having a heart attack right after . too greasy for my taste ! 
if you are looking for good fresh homestyle italian cooking this is the place . i sat in the lounge during happy hour and the had incredible specials . broccoli rabe and grilled sausage to die for . some advise order the pizza thin and well done it will rival new havens best . this place shows it has the whole family involvled . another night we had the pork and fish specials , large portions cookked and seasoned perfectly . large friendly bar area . 
this place was small , french and adorable - a great place for lunch and a great glass of wine . the staff is attentive and the cod particularly good . i would come again and will remember it as a neighborhood favorite . 
i went near to closing time . damn me for doing that . they were all out of pork buns . you don ' t even want to know about my love and affection for pork buns and the complete lack of them in jersey city and hoboken . damn myself . my man and i went with steamed dumplings and a pork sesame pancake . the dumplings were amazing . yes N for N . damn . i definitely preferred the pork and chive over the pork and cabbage . the sesame pancakes were some of the best . definitely greasy and could have used a bit more meat but again somewhere along the lines of N . they were large and almost sandwich like with shredded carrots , pulled meat between two fried sesame bread slices . this place is a whole but , had the a on the window which is nice and reassuring . a few things minus the pork bun fiasco ( and in my mind it was a fiasco ) , they charged us more than the stated price - about N . is that the white girl charge ? i didn ' t say anything . i just took it . and second , we wanted to bring some home and they were all out of the frozen dumplings as well . wtf . i love dumplings . so i ' ll be back like anytime i ' m in a N mile radius and in nyc . but , may venture out and try some other joints to compare . 
hated it . definitely not the place if you ' re looking for classy . if eating on a paper plate and paying extra is your thing then this is the place for you . food was small servings . definitely not worth the price that was charged . 
went here last night and had the totto chicken ramen ( chicken base broth with sliced pork ) added seasoned avocado and egg . the chicken broth is so good ! the avocado was so good but the egg was kinda bland but cooked to perfection . i truly enjoyed the ramen . we got there at N N and it was packed . when we left there was a line to get in . it is really hot in there if you are at the bar . i will definitely go back ! 
extremely flavorful food , despite its simplicity . i highly recommend the half chicken- which is quite literally the most delicious rotisserie chicken i ' ve ever had ( don ' t tell my mom ! ) . i agree with the other postings that the wait can be a little long and the service can be a little slow , but it ' s well worth it . even if i didn ' t live around the corner , i would make the effort whenever i was in the mood for a filling , inexpensive , puerto rican meal . 
i l o v e f o o d came for a friend ' s gathering for halloween for food and drinks . there was a mystery drink that was right up my alley ! ! ! ! i happen to be a picky sweet drinker and it worked for me but that ' s not the point . . the point is the food . pricing is not bad at all . why ? because the food portions are generous as are the flavors . catfish bites . it was a twist on fish n chips . . bite size . it ' s hard to go wrong with fried fish . it went well quesedilla . also well portioned . fresh ingredients is really what makes a good quesedilla and you can tell . wings . great buffalo wings . . . i ' ve had an enduring craving for some good wings and that hit the spot very very well ) i was happy . calamari . again fried seafood . was not fishy at all ! ! ! ! i am very particular about fishiness when it comes to seafood , but there was none at all . philly cheese . good chunks of meat ! ! ! ! ! ! ! on good bread ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! came with spicy cajun fries . they actually made my mouth warm up quite well . goodness . . i realized i ate quite a lot for having been here just twice . it only goes to show that the food is really good . staff is friendly and local . they hold actual meaningful conversations with the people sitting at the bar . the place is clean , bathroom is clean , the food is good , and it ' s local . what more do you want ? 
i was very excited about this new japanese izakaya style restaurant around my neighbor and decided to try for the first time . are those ratings for real or were they there drunk ? the fried chicken with eggplant N . N was soggy , greasy with no flavor . . . drenched in saltier than salt soy sauce with scallions . there was no flavor to this easy dish but plain salty . i can cook better than this at home . a small bottle of sake ( N . N ) i ordered hot was served lukewarm . it was same temperature even after i asked the server to warm it up more . i guess his N minute microwave didn ' t do the job . considering not many customers in the store the service was very slow . i seldom get disappointed by japanese eatery but this place is a major disappointment . 
a decent attempt at venezuelan food ( according to my venezuelan boyfriend ) , i usually like the food very much . we always get tajadas , which are the fried plantain with cheese - the cheese is definitely yummy ! we generally just stick to the arepas and avoid the dishes salads etc . we also always get the passion fruit juice . the service is pretty good and the place is always pretty full on weekends . 
we landed here after a few drinks around midnight . . . had the pork sandwiches not crowded at all and it was a good laid back time . . planning to go back a lot during off hours . . 
amazing service and amazing food ! they are very accommodating . we had the farmers market the evening we went and it blew my mind . so much awesome packed into all the veggie dishes . 
ugly restaurant with poor acoustics . although there were few people there , it was very loud . it was also chilly inside . food was mediocre . polenta fries were tasteless salmon crudo was okay pork belly pizza had no pork belly and was overwhelmed by the taste of raw red onion and sauce that was acrid and tasted as if it came from a jar duck pizza was not very tasty fritto misto average no bread bronzino was tiny and dry and ugly--overcooked fish over brown farro with brown olive mix on top duck breast was tasty desserts pear tart was supposed to be made with puff pastry , it wasn ' t the apple beignets were doughy--as in undercooked dough the chocolate cake was okay the wine list was very affordable and the service was polite . overall try elsewhere . 
i ' ve been visiting new york now for almost a week along with my daughter and i must say out of all of the restaurants i ' ve dined in so far , my best experience was today at lillie ' s for brunch . we almost walked right by , as it is quite difficult to tell that the place is actually a restaurant from the outside . anyhow , i am glad i decided to test my luck and come inside . the decor is amazingly beautiful and like nothing i ' ve ever seen before . its almost hard to believe this restaurant is so new with all of its amazing antiques , unique high ceilings and extravagant marble bar . the staff working today were just fabulous . we were greeted by a very sweet hostess , who gave us a very nice table for two in a cozy booth in the back , despite the fact that we did not take the time to reserve one in advance . our waitress was a vibrant and polite young lady , with beautiful red hair , and a ton of personality named danasia ( i could be spelling it wrong ) who , we later realized , was the only waitress working at the time . although we already had the brunch menus in front of us and she had almost every other table in the restaurant busy , she was kind enough to take the additional time to explain the brunch special to us and explain our choices for complimentary beverages . our waitress went on to take our complete order and in almost no time returned with our complimentary beverages a bloody mary and a mimosa . my bloody mary was very delicious and had a great balance of spice and flavor . my daughter really enjoyed her mimosa and even ordered a second . for brunch i ordered the eggs benedict and my daughter had the french toast , recommended by our waitress . surprisingly , even with the amount of tables busy , our food arrived in a timely fashion . we found both choices to be extremely delicious and very tasty . we were fortunate enough to receive any additional necessities for our meal prior to asking because our busboy made sure we were covered on syrup , water and napkins before the food arrived . this made us really happy , considering our experience with this problem at other restaurants we ' ve visited this week in the city . after enjoying our meal and things began to calm down in the restaurant , our waitress came over to offer us coffee or dessert . although we were already stuffed and ready for the check , we had questions about the restaurants history and decor . our waitress told us a ton of fascinating and fun facts about the place and even recommended we visit the downtown location as well . she also went on to tell us about a few of her favorite cool and inexpensive places to visit in the city , which was very kind . we really enjoyed our visit today at lillie ' s for brunch and although it was busy , we are glad to say our waitress made the experience special and surely provided us with great service that will definitely have us visiting again on our next trip to new york ! we definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting new york ! 
pretty cool place . good for brunch and lunch . though i must admit the menu is limited . i wanted lunch at like Np on Nth of july and had only like N options to choose from . i went w the burger . it was good . i don ' t live in the area , but if am ever in the area again would rather eat here than anywhere else . 
came here again but this time for dinner . the dining area is very formal . i think i like the bar and casual sit-down area more . i just noticed the special wood burning grill in the kitchen this time . just a note if you choose a dish that uses this option , it takes longer to cook . it looks like some weird historical contraption with like wheels on both ends . otherwise the decorating of the dining room is beautiful , modern and clean with a grey-taupe background . my date said this was suppose to be a seafood place but we had the quail for appetizer ( kinda gamey , but novel and good ) and then he had the pork chops and i had the elysian fields lamb . seriously , the name of the lamb dish cracked me up . it was superb though and one of the better lamb dishes i have ever had . i cook a lot of chicken , fish , beef , and pork , the generic meats , so when i go out i try to mix it up as far as what i eat i notice so very much enjoyed the quail and wood grilled lamb . i ' d best describe it as succulent with lovely lentils accompanying it . i appreciate when i can eat a dish and know i could never cook anything close to it . i liked the satisfying but not filling portions we were given but my date was complaining i do recall that the meat portions were too small . all around this is a solid place in terms of food and ambience . more formal and classy than hip or trendy . like you could take your grandparents here and they wouldn ' t bat an eyelash or feel out of place . nor would business colleagues or a date when i ' m feeling lazy . i would not come here with friends though . it does have a very locals and business folks who work in the area vibe . 
this place has great fries . be sure to try the sugar free cheesecake , too- it ' s really good . my husband loves the open face roast beef , i like the blts . this is a good , standard diner with good service . 
grand apizza has been making terrific pizza forever . i used to go here when i was a kid and i still visit today . even though the original owners are no longer here , the pizza is the same . my understanding is that the current owner worked for the original owner for many years . compared to other pizza places in the area , their crust is more flimsy and their tomato sauce is more runny . i prefer it that way . it ' s a " soupy " style . you can make a real mess of yourself ( ie sauce cheese on your clothes ) if you ' re not careful . but nobody ever said good food is clean food . if you ever find yourself getting tired of the " big three " ( pepes , sallys , modern ) and have the urge to try a new pizza joint , then i recommend grand apizza . the neighborhood may not appear to be the safest in the city , but they have a decently lit parking lot in back . i ' ve never had any problems with the neighborhood . 
totto ramen was pretty delicious . i am new to the city and have been craving good ramen . i don ' t particularly want to travel too far since i walk almost everywhere and it was getting a bit late . totto is about N blocks away from me so it ' s close in walking distance . they are open to midnight which is great as well . when i got there , i saw a huge line of people waiting ( sometimes a good sign ) so i rushed down the steps to add my name to the wait list . although my bf and i waited almost N mins for a table to open , and ended up having to sit next another couple at one of the tables for N ( a bit awkward ) it still was ok . i got the miso ramen and my bf got the spicy ramen . both were great , personally i enjoyed the miso better , the broth was a bit thicker and had a better flavor for my taste buds . this is a place i would definitely recommend , just as long as you don ' t mind the wait , which is worth it ! 
food is great prices are reasonable for nyc grilled artichoke and french dip sandwich are unbelievable only downfall is no reservations but just means the food is worth the wait and there is always a wait
i give valenca five stars because it never fails as a great quality place to eat that delivers amazing food . every time i come here i have to order the filet mignon on a hot stone . you can cook it to your liking with garlic butter and enjoy a steaming , delicious experience . two large slabs of meat , a mountain full of rice , and potato chip fries that are so crunchy and tasty . i sometimes put the rice on my hot stone to create that fried rice taste . everyone needs to try a piece of meat on the hot stone . the great part is if your stone fizzles out , just ask your waiter for another one and they will simply replace it for you . the appetizers are very good here as well . we usually order the garlic shrimp , the sauce is so good that we dip our bread in it . for the first time i tried the mushrooms filled with crabmeat . i will definitely order those again ! drinks are great too . i like the bar in the front of the restaurant to have a drink while you wait to be seated . their red sangria is delicious ! strong and very tasteful , you can order in a small pitcher for your table . i ' ve always been too full to try the desserts but they look yummy . the staff is friendly , there ' s usually people that come around with flowers and teddy bears for you to buy , and people come out to sing and play instruments for you . dinner and a show . my only complaint is parking is crazy but you can have your car valet park it for you or try to find a spot on the narrow side streets . it ' s worth the parking and the wait ! 
great good , great value . the quality of the sashimi is one of the best among the nearby japanese restaurants . a bit too crowded inside and there ' s quite a bit of wait time during the weekend . 
i love soul food and ever since soul flavors in downtown jersey city shut down , i ' ve been coming to this place . i ' ve tried the sticky wings a few times and they ' re also delicious . the potato salad and mac and cheese are also good . the cobbler is also very good ! 
i absolutely love coming here for brunch because on sundays you get a complementary cocktail ( i prefer the blood orange mimosa , it ' s delish ) . it ' s a little pricey here , so i try not to go too often . also , it ' s usually crowded , and if you don ' t have a reservation then expect to wait . however , it ' s too hard to pass bad judgement on a place that makes the best apple walnut pancakes i ' ve ever had . i ' ve also had their eggs benedict , which were excellent , but omg the pancakes . also , as soon as your seated , you receive a bottle of flat and a bottle of sparkling water for your table . nice touch , i must say . 
we ate at trattoria lincontro last night and it was amazing ! i have to say , i don ' t think i have ever been to a restaurant with more nightly specials . we never ordered off the menu . we decided to have the waiter " feed us " . he brought out a sampling of delicacies that tasted like heaven . my favorite app was the octopus - it was the best i have ever had . for dinner we had a bow tie pasta , langoustines and an artichoke dish . for desert we had " chocolate pizza " - delicious ! we had a bottle of italian wine that the waiter choose for us and it was great for the price ( N ) . i am still full and yet i can ' t wait to go back . 
they have a good southern menu , but i wasn ' t that thrilled with the taste . fried chicken was ok . big pieces of meat but the fried skin lacked flavor . the coleslaw was different . . . very finely chopped which i found intriguing . mac and cheese was good ! the apple pie lacked sweetness , very bland . the fried brussel sprouts salad . . . amazing ! omg , a def must if you go here to eat . the place is very small , so you may have to wait some time for a seat . but , i ' d def go back to try the breakfast . 
food is amazing , espcially the stuff potato ball with meat and raisins are amazing . i could go there just to eat that . i would have gave N stars , but they don ' t wait till you finish your appetizers . so your eating your appetizers and your main food is already coming out . slow down please gets annoying . 
i give walter ' s food five stars off top ! i never write yelp reviews or many reviews for that matter but i have to rave about this place . service check impeccable ! we hosted a friend ' s birthday party and they were the most accommodating staff for a group of N . our server michael was very attentive and polite , we never had to ask for anything more than once . managers monica and andrea were very helpful in planning the event , never said no . . . yes was the word of choice at walter ' s food . they went above and beyond to make it a special night for us , outstanding service ! ! food check delightful and delicious ! the variety was perfect for a large group but the lobster roll was the meal of the night . it was sooooooooooooo fu king yummy , left everyone satisfied . one of the best lobster rolls i ' ve ever had . they have a good selection of oysters and have a N happy hour . ambiance check smooth and quaint ! the space is small and intimate . to set the mood right lights are dimmed and oldies are playing . during the spring summer they also have an outside patio . one of the best in bk ! check them out ! 
the N stars is for the lunch special , which is the best in the east village . you get two appetizers . . and i ' ve tried them all- they ' re all great . the food is good , there are other places nearby that probably have better quality of certain dishes , but overall this place is great for lunch . 
firstly this is the hottest place in the west village ( thanks to hey bartender ) . super busy , great drinks , fun atmosphere . . . what more could you want . 
this place is a little hole in the wall down in chinatown that ' s famous for its dollar dumplings . i myself am not a huge fan - i like dumplings that have thinner skin that can be fried more easily . i come here not for the dumplings , but rather the duck pancake . this greasy but delicious sesame pancake has duck and veggies inside and is a great deal for around N a pancake . delicious ! skip the dumplings and go for the pancake - you won ' t regret it ! 
went here today to try something new with a co-worker . well we thought it was a grilled cheese truck first then soon realized it was a toasted sub truck ? i don ' t get it doesn ' t quizno ' s subway do that . . . . well i decided to order the N grilled cheese i saw on their menu . . . and it turned out to be a toasted N " sub with little cheese . . when i opened the sub the cheese was barely melted . and it was not a grilled cheese at all . . . so i asked if i could have some turkey in my cheese sandwich and they agreed to do it , after asking me for N . N additional . of course , i ' ll pay more money for a sandwich i don ' t even want . my co-worker got the roast beef special . . . and there was maybe N piece of roast beef in it . and he had to pay N . N for a pickle and never got the pickle . he was not happy . we will not be returning . . . . 
top staff . top atmosphere . bad beer selection
great ethiopian food , served us even after they had closed the kitchen . good people doing good business . 
a much needed fix after returning from germany . i would give them N stars for carrying " augustiner brau " alone , but the food i ordered was very tasty and authentic . i can ' t wait to go back and try the schwinehaxen with my augustiner brau ! 
from a food perspective , total disappointment . we like seasoning and salt our food at home when cooking ( and even after , depending on the dish ) , but this was outrageous . the grilled bread w ricotta and hot mushroom appetizer was pretty inedible due to oversalting , and the hot mushrooms actually curdled the cheese . shrimp small plate had quality seafood , but again , way too salty . shaved salad was best dish of night . . . good , but that ' s a problem when the salad is the best . short rib dish overpromised , but underdelivered . . . solid , but nothing special . the vegetarian special ( squash with a sticky risotto on top ) was good . i was leaning towards a N star review , but the waitress we had was really poor . she started off strong thru her explanations , but after our initial order , she showed up maybe twice the rest of the evening . . . and was clearly not happy to be there . at the end of the meal , she literally dropped off our check and walked out the front door . too many great restaurants in philadelphia to return here . . . pass . 
i though la used to have the best tacos but boy was i wrong . they have small plates that you can share and have large portions as well . their appetizers and rinks are good and filling too if you just want to go for a cheaper alternative although their prices are beyond fair . sometimes they do get ridiculously busy but that ' s because they ' re so good . again , no matter how busy they are , service has always been impeccable . 
had breakfast here , overall a great experience . everyone there was extremely friendly , and the food ( various kinds of tacos ) was excellent . the highlights delicious refried beans , quality chorizo , and the hot salsa was the best i ' ve had in a long time . it has a nice burn to it , but it has a multidimensional flavor and if you like spicy you can pour a fair amount onto your taco ( it ' s so good you will want to ) . will be back to try dinner . . . hopefully tonight ! 
fort defiance is one of those restaurants i couldn ' t wait to run back home to write a review for ( get a life , right ? i know . ) i want to scream at the top of my lungs to let everyone know how much i love this place . i ' m going to skip right to the part where my knees got weak . . . that biscuit egg sandwich is without a doubt in my mind heaven sent and i ' m not even religious . now i believe there is a god . it is definitely the best choice i have made to start off this new year . at first glance , the sandwich looks unassuming . but as soon as you bite into it , your life changes . i know this also because my boyfriend was watching me take the first bite and he wondered why i never look at him the same way . he ' s just no competition to this biscuit . everything about it is perfect . the flavorful cheddar biscuit ( i love biscuits in general , but this took it to the next level ) , the perfectly fried egg ( not too runny , not overcooked ) , the ham ( honestly , this was probably the least memorable ingredient ) and most importantly whatever crack they put in that jalapeno jam . not caring that my boyfriend was watching this affair unfold before his eyes , i lustfully seduced the biscuit . . . " i ' ll be jalapeno jam any day ! " to top this off , my chai latte was banging . most chai lattes are more or less the same . but this was one was silky smooth , not grainy , perfectly warm and not too hot with just the right amount of foam . also for some reason , it is all white ( not that i have preference over color , but a white chai latte is something i consider exotic and hey ! i like to try new things ) . the collard greens and the gingerade were equally as good . my boyfriend had the richmond , but honestly , we can ' t tell if it is even good or not because it was utterly out-shined by the biscuit sandwich . i can ' t wait to come back for a second date with this place , looking forward to trying their dinner . 
el pabellon . delicious . i wish it was less expensive though , but overall , i ' m a fan . 
margarita pizza was amazing love the fact that they use real fresh mozzarella . takes a bit of time to get our food to our table . but hey it ' s fresh pizza i was fine with the wait . next time i will try with different toppings . 
caf mulino is one of our favorite restaurants in the area . i ' ve lived in ewing for N years and i was very glad when caf mulino came onto the restaurant scene . the food is consistently good , consisting of wonderful combinations of fresh and delicious ingredients . we are always warmly welcomed and i appreciate that the owner who graciously stops by to make sure we are enjoying our meal . as a vegetarian i ' ve always been pleased with my selection and special requests have always been accommodated . they serve the best pasta prima vera i ' ve ever had . my carnivorous friends and family have always been pleased as well ! the service is usually top-rate with friendly waiters who are attentive without being invasive . if i could change any aspect it would be that as with many restaurants , as numbers of people enjoy their dinners , sound-absorbing furnishings would be in order . that being said , i ' ve taken clients , family and friends to caf mulino and they ' re always eager to return . 
best vodka rigatoni i ' ve had . good salads and tasty bread . really wish they had a happy hour . this place is very close to my office and i would love to enjoy the classy atmosphere without the expensive drink prices . go at lunchtime when the menu is much less expensive than the dinner menu . 
one of our favorite sushi places ! been here more than N times and its consistently fresh tasty ! not a lot of places to sit i don ' t think there ' s a bathroom , but totally worth it ! 
chicken and rice . it ' s that simple . get more of the white sauce and dump a lot of it on your plate . it ' s a simple food cart that delivers ridiculous amount of food . 
best crepes ever ! ! ! ! took my best friend there for his birthday just to taste them . . and he loved it ! ! ! soon i ' ll be taking my mom when she comes to visit from the caribbean in jan N . i refuse to make her leave again without having shade ' s crepes . my favorite crepe is the smoked salmon , goat cheese with spinach or mushrooms . i am always fantasizing about shade ' s crepes . keep it up ! ! ! ! ! ) 
karma is a fantastic indian restaurant . on my last visit , i had a wonderful experience . the service was phenomenal and the food was amazing ! one of the best indian restaurants in philly . i highly recommend checking it out ! 
awesome place - good value , good food and very attentive service . it doesn ' t look that authentic from the outside but it ' s pretty charming inside . my friend and i had a number of the dinner snacks and their special of the day . crispy tofu was excellent , as was the papaya salad . the thai iced coffee was great and my friend said their longan drink special was really tasty . the only drawback ( and it wasn ' t even a drawback ! ) is that it ' s pretty small and if you sit near the back by the kitchen , you will get bumped into by those passing in and out . 
slow service but good drinks and food . loud music though . 
the most fabulous cheesecake i ' ve ever had . the prices are a bit on the high side and the pastrami and roast beef sandwiches were just average . for the best sandwiches go to katz deli , N e houston st , new york , ny N , ( N ) N-N , katzdeli . com in N , restaurant founder harry rosen and master baker eigel peterson , created and produced what is now known as the world ' s most fabulous cheesecake . the recipe has been part of the rosen family for three generations . 
food here was ok . very inconisistent . chicken liver pasta was great as well as the octopus pizza . the pork special and the steak was terrible . service here was really weak . seemed uninterested and very annoyed with us . we do not look like the ritzy customer they are used to so didn ' t give good service but in the end she was wrong because we had a big check and i ' ve been in the business for N years and still am and she definitely hurt herself in the tip area . all in all a little inconsistent , weak service , cool vibe , and very very pricey . will not return , will not reccomend to anyone , but will not stop anyone from going either . 
not sure why this place ranked so high , burgers were average at best . 
the pizza here is good , albeit overhyped . with the caveat that they ran out of the white clam pizza by the time i got there , so i didn ' t get to try that . we ordered another white pizza , and although it was good , it ' s nothing i ' d go too far out of my way to drive to get . next time i go , i will have to try the clam pziza and update my review . 
it was very noisy and we got a small table stuck between a big group of people and a spacious corner seats for a couple . waht is the point of making reservation if we are given lousy seats ? first the hostess wanted to give us a table near the front door where people are waiting in line . it was very noisy and cold so we asked for another table . oyesters were good . escargo was good . my stake was a bit dry . don ' t know if it was supposed to be that way - french style ? maybe . it was not memorable . very noisy and we got tired of noise quickly . don ' t want to go back there . it is a tourist place . food is fine but you would expect as much because it is quite pricy . 
went here on friday for a friend ' s birthday . the restaurant has a nice ambiance , lots of people and it ' s loud near the bar which is what we were looking for . ordered the chorizo for appetizer , it was delicious ! served on fire which makes for a nice presentation . i had the bife do lombo na telha . it was juicy and tender , really yummy . i would go back and order that again . my friend ordered the skirt steak na telha , although it was good it wasn ' t a match for the sirloin . overall , the experience was excellent ! i will definitely be going back and introducing friends to the restaurant . i can see myself easily becoming a regular
excellent quality food and above average list of beverages including several ciders . 
i used to go to yakitori taisho in the east village , but yakitori totto is definitely a step up in terms of quality and ambience . plus , they have ac and it makes a world of a difference eating here during the summertime . there ' s not a whole lot of space and it ' s pretty intimate , therefore i highly recommend coming early to grab a table . the chefs really took their time and effort to keep your foods moist and flavorful and it ' s always nice to see actual japanese people running a japanese restaurant . my personal favorites for the night was the eringi bacon , seared tuna and the ice banana dessert . will definitely stop by in the future . 
quite the most appalling customer experience imaginable . i ' m a semi regular at this place and have always found it to be ok . not amazing but perfectly acceptable for quick sit down lunch . what happened today has changed my view completely . my lunch partner and i sat down at N . Npm . although there was a large party at the table opposite , the place as a whole was not busy . after N minutes no one had come to take our order or even offer us a drink . when the waitress finally showed up she was genuinely apologetic and we ordered a club soda , a cola and two salads . at Npm . a full N minutes after sitting down there was still no sign of the food . when we asked our waitress she told it would be another N-N before our food would be ready . at this we stood up and made to leave . we hadn ' t got to the door before we were intercepted by the manger who insisted that we pay for two sodas before leaving . i pointed out that we had been waiting almost an hour for our food and that it was the least they could do by way of an apology to comp us our drinks but he was not to be swayed . after a several minutes of face to face heated remonstrations in which the manager refused to accept that we had been poorly treated and insisted we pay for two sodas , he finally relented and we left . this place clearly has no idea how treat its customers . i ' d be surprised if they have many left . stay away . 
with so many brunch places to choose from , sotto N definitely has to be one of them ! it definitely has a different approach to " brunching , " but the boozy brunch is a must . unlimited bellinis ( delicious ) , mimosas , bloody mary ' s , plus amazing food . i came here with N other girlfriends for sunday brunch , and we decided to do the boozy brunch for Nea , which turns into more btw if you order any menu items with next to them . it turns into N per person per dish that is . but honestly , the other items were worth it . the best steak eggs i have ever had and the lasagna was different , but delicious . it also comes with a pizza side . the potatoes are great i would strongly recommend those . of course i " eyed " every other item that went to every other table . . it all looked amazing ! you will not be disappointed at sotto N ! 
i ' ve wanted to visit vintage for quite some time now , and after realizing they were participating in sips i decided it was the perfect ( read cheapest ) way to try it out . the place was pretty packed ( not surprising - it was a beautiful day and i ' m sure every single sips location was equally crowded ) , but i didn ' t have any issue ordering drinks ( had N glasses of the red wine , which at N each were a steal , and N glass of tasty sangria for N . gotta love sips prices ! ) . i wish i had ordered some food to try , but to be honest i really was only focused on the dranks . the staff was very friendly and super accommodating , and the space is great , with a good amount of outdoor seating and an open-air feel . definitely a good sips ( or any night , if you ' re not as cheap as i am ) option , and while i can ' t speak for the taste of the food everything i saw definitely looked yummy ! 
had a wonderful dinner in almost every aspect . the place is upscale , well decorated in a very simple way and the service was excellent - from the hostess to the wait staff . we sampled a bunch of appetizers and they were all really good - fried calamari , chorizo , tuna tartar . everyone had the steaks - mostly bone-in rib-eye and porterhouse and i have to say , it was excellent . the steaks were perfectly seasoned and cooked to exact order . clearly a superior cut , dry-aged which was on par with some of the best nyc steakhouses . all the sides were also excellent , very well prepared and tasty . the biggest plus is the byob ( which you can hardly find in a high-end steakhouse in the nyc metro area ) - huge plus is that the waiter was very skilled and artful in opening and decanting the bottles . . . a generally lost skill in byob places . very , very good place and would definitely go back . 
went last night and the food was actually very good and the atmosphere was very nice . why i give it only one star if you have a good allergy intolerance , be careful before ordering . i need to eat gluten free and the waitress told me the tacos were not but the enchiladas were gluten free , and as i experienced symptoms of " glutening " this morning , i decided to call up the restaurant for a second opinion . this time they told me the enchiladas were not gluten free . burger and barrel , you need to take these things seriously . . . make sure your staff and chefs know what allergies are out there and what ' s in your food ! ! ! 
this was by far one of the worst costumer service experiences i ever had in my life . i don ' t care where a business is located , there should still be a level of hospitality . there was zero here ! i have never ordered from here before , there was no signage that explained which way the line was going or the ordering process . there was just a crowd of people waiting at the counter when my N year old daughter and i arrived . after asking several people standing toward the back if they had ordered already , we made our way to the front where we waited in the crowd for N minutes never being acknowledged until the man behind the counter asked the gentleman standing next to me what he wanted . he then turned to me and said " did you stand in that line down there ? " i replied , " what line ? there ' s just a crowd of people . " he says , " oh yeah well , you gotta stand in line . " it took everything in me not to flip because he saw me standing there the entire time with my daughter who now was growing restless from waiting so long . i wasn ' t going to wait in that line because i had already waited too long and asked him why he hadn ' t said anything when he saw me standing there the entire time ? " he ignored me and waited on the next costumer . of course i wasn ' t going to patronize them at this point so i took my child , crying " but , i ' m hungry " and left . bottom line is there ' s a way to treat people and that was not it ! there ' s a certain level of organization that your business should have and that wasn ' t it ! i don ' t care how good your product is . i work too damn hard for my money to be giving it to somebody who treats me like this . you never know if your next costumer could make or break you . treating the wrong costumer inappropriately could ruin your entire business . . . ijs . 
love this place . my husband and i went here for our first wedding anniversary last summer . he is so not an adventurous eater but i convinced him to try tapas . . . and he loved it . so did i--especially the cheese plates . my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it . and the octopus is really good , too . the mojito was a little too minty , but still really good . it ' s pricey , like tapas always is , but totally worth it for a nice night out . i liked the decor , the waitress was super sweet , and the food is definitely worth it . 
bianca ' s is quickly becoming my go-to spot for visitors . it is small , no reservations , but is cozy . the service is great , but the food . . . . it ' s amazing . i haven ' t had a bad dish yet . my favorite might be the lasagna but don ' t stop there . and the prices are incredible . bianca ' s is a must . 
it ' s a solid diner . service is always great . the mozzarella sticks are just ok . which is why not N stars . i love sticks so i couldn ' t give that Nth star . everything else was great though and i go here a lot . very clean and friendly people . 
my friends and i went to the smith after watching the latest batman movie . while the space is a bit loud , it was the perfect place to debrief over beers , cool cocktails , and a wide range of food oysters , deviled eggs , tuna tartare , and desserts , to be exact . the bread pudding dessert was truly delightful . the cava ain ' t half bad , and the price was perfect for our table , too . 
the falafel were superb , stuffed grape leaved were very delicious , mixed grills were excellent and very flavorful , and the kenafah was very good . the place was very noisy , we were screaming to hear each other and the kenafah was slightly salty , but these are minor things . the big picture , this was most authentic lebanese food i ' ve had in the us ! 
it ' s close to work and i ' m grateful for that because it ' s an easy choice -- let ' s go to the prop ! that ' s what we call it in my office and we goof around about " props for the prop . " i know , nerdy , but whatev . super wait staff and a few of my favorite bartenders south of houston . 
no green tea kit kats ! 
the hookah hits very well and the pasta was incredible ! ! 
love this place ! i have never had a bad meal here . tonight , a friend and i dined al fresco . amanda , our server , was lovely - friendly and attentive , but not overbearing and very knowledgeable about the menu . we enjoyed the special soup of the day , a creamy artichoke with chipotle that was warm , smoky , and rich . we also had the special sweet crepe of the day which was delicious - sweet potatoes poached in coconut milk and pureed , accompanied by caramel sauce , toasted pecans , and vanilla gelato . per usual , my savory entree crepe was generously portioned and full of fresh ham , cheddar , and broccoli . i thoroughly enjoyed their appetizer salad of house greens with a mustard vinaigrette - pleasingly tangy with a hint of bite . beau monde is one of my favorite places to end a spring afternoon with a good friend . 
amis is a wonderful addition to a fomerly barren block of south Nth street near lombard . the design is clean and chic , and i was looking forward to checking out what all the buzz is about----as this place is always completely packed . unfortunately , i along with the other N members of our dining party , were completely disappointed by the meal and experience . first of all the highlights---the bruscheta with caponate is truly amazing and i ' d highly recommend it . any the pasta with swordfish is good as well as is the mixed grill . here ' s what ' s not so good the turkey cutlet , the carpaccio , the sweetbreads , the fritto mixto ( think bad tempura at beni-hana , i ' m not lying ) , the polenta . the service was not great either----one member of our party received the drink that she ordered along with her entree ( after we all had apps and salads ) . the staff was young and attractive , but not terribly informed about the food-----when asked , everything was ' great ' or ' awesome ' . if you are claustrophic , please stay away as this place is really cramped , i mean , you are literally elbow to elbow with your neighbor and at the bar , it ' s uncomfortably close . the wine list is actually quite good , with a number of unusual offerings by the glass . watch out for the N martinis though . 
i think you only go here for two items if you ' re not lucky enough to be a chinatown resident the chive and pork dumplings and the duck sesame pancake--just look at the highlighted items on the yelp summary and there you have it . you have to try it for yourself and if you ' re vegetarian , may the force of self-control be with you . i think that both items were quite doughy and a little lacking in the meat portions on the inside . the dumplings were my favorite and definitely had a tasty chivey flavor . at a very good price ( N for a buck ) i wasn ' t as blown away by their food as the hype believed me to think but if you enjoy much more dough around your dumplings rather than meat , you may beg to differ . this doesn ' t mean i ' d never come here again--it just makes me want to sample all that chinatown dumpling shops have to offer . the seasame pancake with duck is awesome and unique and is essentially a folded pancake sandwich ( see picture ) no-nonsense service and withholding of chopsticks an authentic nyc dumpling house . 
got to update this . went there recently and got there at N N to try to get in the first seating for the Npm opening for dinner on a saturday . got in . service was so spot on , as it always has been , ambience very nice , the pork buns and pork rib appetizers were so good , and the sake recommendation excellent , that it is worth the price . dinner for two with N bowls of ramen , N apps and a small bottle of good sake came to around N plus tip i think . it ' s worth it . have had only had the ramen here a few times , but it is absolutely delicious porky goodness . a little pricey or would have been N stars . definitely plan on going back to try more stuff but only during off hours like random weekday afternoons between N-N when you can get a table for one in about N minutes . 
an interesting slice . it ' s sicilian but i guess it ' s grandma style . they actually compose the pizza by putting the cheese on first then smothering it with sauce then sprinkling parmesan on top . the logic is that placing the cheese prevents any sogginess in the crust . . . they use a lot of crust . i enjoyed it . . . it ' s hard to compare to other sicilian slices i ' ve had because it ' s so different . forget comparisons , i think their version of the sicilian slice is very good . . . i wish i could give it N . N stars but opted for N because i really like the huge outdoor area they have going on . it feels sort of like a blast ifrom the past and you have kids , families , older people all gathered around enjoying anything from calamari , pizza , to ice cream . it was a pleasure eating pizza outdoors on a saturday night while drinking N dollar cans of bud . btw , the restaurant looked great . . . i ' ll have to go back and try . the portions looked tremendous . . . like you come here to eat . . . eat like tony soprano or fat pussy . 
came here to add to my pizza adventures . i have to say was disappointed in the lack of flavor . in comparison to other well known pizza places it falls short . in my pizza rankings pepe ' s and luzzo ' s are far superior
roast turkey club is a must--the person who created this sandwich really gave a damn . the fixin ' s--pesto , avocado , sprouts , bacon are excellent flavor enhancers but don ' t dominate the turkey itself , which is quite fresh and moist . side salad of greens is very fresh and naturally peppery . the burger is quite solid as well , and i ' m a bit of a snot about those . probably the last place in brooklyn where you can find high-quality ground beef at N a pop . service and vibe are extremely welcoming and attentive w o being overbearing . great spot to fuel up before or after braving the lines at ikea then again , if you live in the neighborhood , you could easily become a regular and try something different every time . other nice touches include serving house-made seltzer water and running lefthand milk stout on nitrous feed , a smooth , creamy welcome upgrade over ubiquitous guinness . many other places emphasize on local , quality ingredients , but here , you can truly taste the difference . bascially , great food and atmosphere at reasonable prices . 
what more can you ask for from a local neighborhood italian restaurant ? friendly service , great food , fun theme nights all you can eat pasta night prime rib night live music night mama flora ' s has it all . eat in or get it delivered . i love their chicken parm ( both the sandwich and the dinner ) . gary makes a damn fine pizza , with great topping combos like artichokes and sausage . 
delicious but pricey local food from jean-george around the corner from union square . it ' s hard to get a reservation but skip open table and call the establishment directly . we were seated at Npm on a wednesday night so good luck if you ' re trying on the weekend . we started with the peekytoe crab bread and it was divine . add the fresh table salt and squeeze fresh lemon to taste . then i had the pork and my friend had the cod fish . my dish was a bit salty but the apricots and figs made for a sweet and savory bite . the best part of the meal , however , was my red wine and the caramel ice cream sundae . the wine was the most expensive on on the list you could get by the glass at N . the chardonnay here is actually more crisp than the reisling . this for me , is a special occasion restaurant and you can probably expect to spend around N person if you ' re splurging . 
i get take out from this restaurant at least twice a month . the steamed vegetable dumplings are out of this world . the kitchen is always hopping . i really have never had a bad meal from here ever . 
busy atmosphere , loud and noisy . grate people watching . the filet mignon is superb and the brunch is incredible . 
i love this place as a clean , inexpensive and filling place to eat . heap your food sky high or just take a bite . . . it ' s perfect because they they weigh your plate and that ' s what you pay . 
great food . the seafood pad pen was good and spicy ! pad thai was good . loud and upbeat . calamari appetizer was different but good too . good choice for hells kitchen . 
blend on the water was the perfect place to have a summer evening dinner with my sister . we sat outside and enjoyed the breeze and view . our server was javier he was incredible . javier was pleasant , polite and right on point with all of his recommendations . the food was tasty the drinks were satisfying and the atmosphere was on point . an extra special shout out to carlos , teamwork is reflection of leadership and you are doing a great job . 
i ' ve been coming about N-N times a month for lunch and have enjoyed it every time . i tend to stick to same items , but the entire menu looks good . my favorite is the sliced steak with cilantro ginger chimichurri plate . the quality of steak is great for the price and the ginger sauce pairs really well . the freshness of the rice and salad that comes with it is an added bonus . it gets really crowded during lunch but the staff is always patient and attentive . i tend to opt out of dining in and take it back to the office . mooncake is cash only but if you ' re getting it to go you can order with a card on their site . 
first the pros the chicken rendang nasi lemak , fried rice and hot vietnamese coffee hit the spot . rice was a little soggy but that ' s personal preference i suppose . like the old style malaysian coffee shop vibe . service is fast , friendly but forgetful . we didn ' t get the fried chicken or milk tea we ordered , and instead of the laksa they served us the curry noodles . owner came by to chat a few times , which was nice . N half stars for me . 
came at N Np . website said midnight . told us they were closed . went to bea ' s which was great . 
i am a sushi fanatic and a server . hj house has the cheapest sushi in burlington . it ' s cheaper than the mediocre roll at city market and a billion times better . i enjoyed my experience there with the helpful service far more than all the other sushi restaurants . also , my mushroom soup was made specifically for my order you can tell it was not sitting out in the kitchen in a warmer all day . thank you so much guys ! 
i know i ' m being pretty generous dishing out five stars for my first review in nearly ten months but godfriggindamnit , i love me some barbecue brisket sandwiches . ( psst ! i ' ve found my new favorite place to order ' em . ) for N , the diameter of the sandwich bun might look small but the amount of meat they pack on there is well worth it . it ' s so moist and delicious and full of barbecue-y goodness , you might not even need to add any of their three different sauces . and since barbecue can get messy , especially if you ' ve had a couple happy hour beers ( N cans and local pints ! ) beforehand , it ' s a good thing they have paper towels hooked right onto the table ! as far as appetizers go , if you aren ' t a fan of deviled eggs you should go hide your head in shame . not really , but try theirs--i promise you ' ll be turned onto them . they ' re so light and fluffy and insanely tasty that you ' ll inhale ' em in less than a minute . i was poppin ' those suckers like tic tacs . 
we ordered take out and let me first say the food was just fine . that was the only thing that was though . when we called , they said N minutes for take out , because it was busy . an hour and N minutes later our dinner was ready . if you like your chinese restaurant to look like old rundown bus station this is your number N pick . the customers even had that same hopeless lost soul look as they waited for their dinners of general tao and fried rice . 
i live nearby and was really looking forward to liking this place . great location and amazing beer selection . i ' d really like to give it a good review but the service here is horrid and the food is barely above edible . seriously . the food is that bad , and the floor staff is so slow and out of it that it ' s just impossible to say anything positive about the place other than it ' s great beer and location . fix the food . it ' s really bad
i am a registered dietitian and an aerobics instructor and absolutely love the selection they have ! bobs plate is my favorite ! i definitely recommend anything on the menu to everyone in the area ! it ' s definitely worth the visit
dinner here was great ! the service was spot on - enough to make sure we had everything we needed , but we were given the time and space to relax and enjoy our food and wine . we were given a couple of plates to try - really appreciated that ! loved the simple , rustic decor . would have liked to sit in the garden - it was just too hot ! 
excellent dinner with nicole ! we came here during hamden restaurant week and the deal was fantastic--two small tapas , one large tapas and a dessert all for N--can ' t go wrong with that ! we were seated promptly upon arriving and a decanter of water was brought to the table . the restaurant decor is dark and modern with a nice bar area , very comfortable . we started with the white sangria--very refreshing and full of chopped lemon and apple . the main reason we chose this restaurant for dinner was that they denote on the menu which dishes are gluten free . nicole , who has a true gluten allergy , can sometimes have trouble finding a restaurant to dine at without having to eat salads or steak . nicole had the chorizo con alubias ( white beans and chorizo in a hard cider broth ) , tortilla espanola ( potato and onion omelet with aioli ) , and a paella with chorizo , chicken , clams , shrimp and mussel . she enjoyed each one of her dishes , although we waited quite a while for the paella to come out . i had the croquettas de iberico ( ham croquettes--very creamy , nice sauce puree accompanied it , although i don ' t know what it was ) , pepito de bistec ( grilled beef shoulder , chimichurri on toast--chimichurri gave it a bit of spice , nicely portioned and plated ) and solomillo de cerdo ( pork loin with chunks of polenta , smoked bacon and a citrus sauce--pork was perfectly cooked , although i liked the sauce so much , i wish there was more than just a drizzle ) . nicole mentioned she never gets to have dessert unless it ' s ice cream , since there is rarely a dessert that doesn ' t contain gluten but tonight , she was in luck ! she had the torta de santiago--almond flourless torte which was nice and light and had a good flavor . i had the torrija borracha--caramelized bread pudding with a lemon peel ice cream . the bread pudding was actually very good--i never order bread pudding but i would definitely get this one again , the caramelized top really did it for me . the scoop of lemon peel ice cream was so shocking and a huge contrast to the sugar sweet bread pudding , very different ! overall , we had a nice dinner . would definitely come back to try dishes from the regular menu ! 
i wish i was dead instead of having just eaten boloco . 
got there at N N on a saturday morning . no wait . by the time we left at N N the place was packed and there was a huge wait . they have a nice lounge area where you can wait and get a coffee so its not like you are freezing outside . i had the breakfast burrito and it was the most perfect burrito i have had . the presentation itself was phenomenal . service was good and prices are a bit cheaper than sabriana ' s so its definitely worth a shot and i will definitely be back . 
largely unremarkable , the only difference between audrey claire and N manning is the full bar in the latter . 
love this place . this place used to be my favorite but since it was on that tv show wait times have grown and quality ' s gone down a little . still one of my favorite izakayas . don ' t forget to check out the grilled mackerel . that bigass fish may look intimidating but it ' s freaking delicious . 
came here for dinner with a group of six people on a saturday night . we had a reservation , but it was not crowded at all , even at Npm . if you ' re in the mood for thai on the weekend this might be a good spot to avoid the crowds . however , it got me wondering , why is no one here ? the food was mostly good and with enormous portions ( although way too salty ) , but the service was as slow as it comes . you need to do a lot of work getting your waiter ' s attention . also , i didn ' t feel like the food was super authentic so if you ' re super picky about that sort of thing ( yes , there ' s pad thai on the menu ) then maybe try someplace else . 
if your a big fan of shit " shooting " out of your ass for more than a week . . . . then this is the place for you ! you suck mamoun ! 
this is my favorite restaurant in the city - hands down ! i never had a bad experience ever . food is excellent , service is superb and the ambience is sophisticated and elegant . this is a perfect place for special occasions - you won ' t be disappointed . best part is that it ' s still affordable given the exemplary presentation and dishes he whips up . it makes other restaurant make you feel stupid going there . this is the place to go ! it ' s a must go to place for me . 
based on my first meal here , i ' m a fan . seating was prompt , service was friendly , and the food was very good . i started with a spinach salad with beets , corn and peppers while i ' m not generally enthusiastic about corn , its sweetness and crunch complemented the other sweet veggies well . also , the cherry tomatoes were sliced , which is unfortunately often not the case . overall , a well-made and attractively presented salad and an auspicious start to the dining experience . i followed up with the eggs florentine , about which there ' s not much to say they were good . the eggs were cooked right and , more importantly , so was the kale it was neither cooked to death nor rough and raw . and yes , as others have pointed out , the breakfast potatoes were delicious and perfect for scraping up yolk . i hope this place finds its customers and survives , because i look forward to returning and exploring the menu further . 
joey is truly amazing ! his fantastic character matches his amazing food . lunch will run only N or N . classic thai dishes . everything i have tried i have liked . very bright and cheery little place . i will even admit to going there on a saturday night all by myself and had a very yummy and special time . my usual is a thai iced tea , soup ( i like them all ) , and pad see-ew or pad thai . 
exactly . meh . experienced better . if you have a hankering for a burger , don ' t go here unless you are satisfied with a ginormous amount of cheap ground round beef bleeding on a cheap bun . okay , i ' m actually giving it too much credit and depicting it in a way that might make it seem that it ' s actually tasty . this burger has no flavor ! the burger i ordered was so bland it made my home burgers seem amazing . this is not mentioning that i ordered the burger medium and the burger that was served to was medium rare . the two waitresses that assisted me , ( huh ? ) , were apathetic and lackluster in the return of my burger . why are there never any managers observing such immature and annoying behavior when it matters ? i ' m not banning them or anything , just noting that it ' s totally underwhelming and if you ' re more into taste like me then you ' re better of heading to petey ' s in queens or frying up your own pat la frieda shortrib burger from fresh direct . 
late night , dinner time , lunch time . . . if you ' re into this street cart , cheap food , amazing smells then the halal guys is for you . yes believe the hype , i ordered the combination over rice , everything was well-seasoned and whenever you can get extra white sauce . second time i ordered just the chicken and rice and it was as great as the first time . talk about consistency cooking in big batches . now i know why people crave this so much when they come back home . let the halal guys withdrawals begin , and i haven ' t even left ny ! 
some of the finest seafood i ' ve had . the fish and chips were excellent . 
i ' ve been to the office a few times . i stuck mainly to the bar food , hot wings , burger , beer and everything was ok . i like the environment , laid back and relaxing . nothing spectacular but not bad . i ' ve had good experiences with the wait staff for the most part . the last time i went there however , i was extremely disappointed . we went in with the intention of having drinks and dinner and they were a little busier than normal so we were seated in the back area . we had to wait quite a while to order our drinks and appetizer , because our server knew some customers who were seated at another table and spent most of her time chatting it up with them . we finally got our hot wings ( brought out by someone else ) but we still didn ' t have drinks or plates to eat off of ! it was at least an hour ( since arrival ) before we finally had drinks and plates . the hot wings were mediocre in taste and skimpy on sauce . after the hot wings were eaten and our drinks almost gone our server came back and asked if we wanted to order dinner ( Nhr N min after arrival ) . we politely refused and asked for the check . she immediately got it for us ( the only thing we didn ' t have to wait for that night ) and we got out of there to eat somewhere else . there are so many good places to eat . don ' t bother with the office . 
good spot for take out mexican . the tacos can be dry sometimes , nothing a little salsa verde can ' t fix . the rice and beans are good but a little expensive for a side . we have had some problems but nothing that would not keep me from calling on my lazy days . all together a decent spot for your middle of the road mexican food . 
we are local residents . we had high hopes for agricola . local farm to table . ex french laundry chef . i called on a wednesday evening at Npm to see if a table for two was available . " can you hold please . " i was put on hold for N minutes . just as i was about to hang up and call back the hostess came back on the line . i asked for a table for two for tonight . " we can seat you at N Npm . " i accepted the reservation . we arrived at N N and were ignored when standing at the hostess desk . they did not greet us . i finally got one of them acknowledge our reservation for N N and told them we would have a drink in the bar while waiting for our table . the acknowledgement was brisk , cold and unwelcoming . we sat at a community table in the bar . we ordered two martinis . it took longer than it should have to receive our drinks . when the drinks arrived i noticed that they were N N full . the glasses were room temperature . i took a sip . it tasted strongly of a sweet low grade vermouth with a nasty aftertaste . this was the worst martini i ' ve ever tasted . i spoke to the waitress and politely pointed out that the bartender did not know how to make a martini and asked why was the glass N N full . she told me that they measure out all of their drinks using a " template " and that they would not pour more . i said fine , but it tastes overly sweet and bad . the waitress went to the manager with our feedback . they decided to comp us two glasses of wine with dinner . next the hostess arrived and told us that our reservation was for friday night not tonight ( wednesday ) . i politely but firmly pushed back that this was not the case , reciting the phone call we had an hour earlier . then she said " oh well you are in luck as we have a table we can seat you tonight . do you want to keep your reservation for friday ? " i told her that no , our reservation was for tonight and we would not be need a reservation for friday night . we were seated immediately . the bar waitress told the hostess to make sure we got two glasses of wine on the house with dinner . we had to tell our waiter to comp the red wine when we ordered it . he smirked . interestingly , red wine came in a white wine glass . the olive oil provided for dipping bread was extremely low grade and rancid tasting . we could not eat it . we ordered the parsnip soup special . the soup was over processed and loaded with sugar which covered up the taste of the parsnip . not something we would expect at an expensive farm to table with an ex french laundry chef . i ordered the arctic char and my wife ordered the scallops . her plate came with a smear of turnip puree and three scallops . nothing else on the plate . more like an appetizer than a dinner plate . the scallops were well cooked and high quality . a small plate for N was not a good value . my fish was a small tail end cut . the plate was cold and the meal was lukewarm . no where near french laundry standards . the owner was walking the floor stoically , arms folded , with a pained look on his face . we did not see him speak with any customers . he seemed focused on observing the staff . no smiles . minimal interactions . the boss inspecting , not coaching . this seemed demotivating to the staff . they kept in constant motion . trying to look busy for the boss . the customers were less important . we skipped desert , paid the check and left . we will not be back . we recommend that you stay away from agricola until they focus on customer experience . this will require a properly trained and motivated staff , better food quality , and more value for the prices charged . and let it flow in bar . 
an intimate setting for gathering with the chums . here i felt a strong sense of solidarity that we are all hearing each other ' s conversations ( relating ) and watching each other ' s expressions ( mirroring ) . try starting off with the " duck egg with tuna bottarga " . this delicate starter would be hard to share ! i recommend getting two , unless you ' re accompanied by a vegan or one who doesn ' t care to try duck eggs . to die for sheep ' s ricotta gnudi with brown butter and sage ( it looks like a small dish but after the first gnudi ( you get six ) , you might think twice that it is ! ) let ' s be real here ! in a city that never sleeps , don ' t expect to not have a long wait . besides , why not take this opportunity to be creative while waiting ( i . e . walk around the block hand-in-hand with your baby or throw your frisbee across the street or enjoy a galoise and watch the world go by ) . paul rudd can pop in looking for someone and you may even get to see his most current do . . . up close and personal ! you would be surprised at how the time just passes and voila . . . your table is ready ! it ' s worth the wait ! . . . but you may just get lucky to not have to . 
this weekend i experienced uva , an italian tapas wine bar located on manhattan ' s upper east side . i was saving this dinner location for a special occasion but since the weather was wonderful this weekend i stepped up my schedule and had a solo dinner date . the restaurant is located on Nnd avenue between Nth and Nth street . the restaurant has garden , indoor , and outdoor seating . uva also has a wine bar and had several selections to meet every budget . today ' s adventure was about trying new cheeses and experiencing black truffles . my research into this restaurant advised me to try the polenta and gnocchi in truffle cream . i was warned that the gnocchi dish was filling so i opted for the polenta . it was a good choice . the polenta tartufata is a lovely polenta filled with robiola cheese in a black truffle sauce . the polenta was smooth and the cream sauce was not too heavy . the robiola cheese was tasty and did not take away from the dish . they blended perfectly . i love the taste of white truffle and found the black truffle to be more sophisticated taste wise . i liked the differences . the pomodoro farcito was a delectable dish of plum tomatoes filled with stracciatella over chopped arugula with balsamic syrup . the stracciatella was smooth and creamy and melted in your mouth . the balsamic syrup added the right saltiness to the dish . for dessert i had the almond tart with vanilla ice cream . the almond tart was a satisfying way to end my meal . the meal was well worth the price and i will visit uva again . 
sleek decor , good food ( great variety ) and very nice service . i will definitely return . we split two rolls , had edamame , and dessert our check came to N with tip . glad that doma is in the neighborhood . 
i have been there for breakfast and was so impressed i went back the next day for lunch ! both times i was greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us promptly . the waitstaff was friendly and we didn ' t wait too long for our meal . i liked the retro d cor . as a vegan i always get excited when i have a choice of vegan items on the menu ! there were three vegan choices for breakfast . recommended by a friend , i chose the vegan buckwheat pancakes with blueberries . they were pretty good . . . large and very filling . . . i could barely get through N ! the pineapple juice was fresh . the next day when i went for lunch , for which there are more vegan options ( than breafast ) . i ordered the garbanzowhich ( a chickpea salad sandwich ) . . . yum ! i would recommend this diner and will definitely be coming back ! 
food is excellent , but sorry to say that the service was pretty horrible ( we had a reservation for N on a saturday and it took about N hours to get our food and only about N other tables in there . ( our waitress was very unfriendly and barely came to check on us or let us know why food was taking long . our out of town guests commented how food was delicious but how horrible the service was . wouldn ' t go there with a larger party . 
i ' ve living in newark all my life and with the explosion of all the new restaurants in the area this is still my go to spot . what ever i like a quick sandwich dinner with the family this is where i go . i ' ve go out to eat for business and pleasure if i have a important client i want to impress spanish sangria is where i go . i highly recommend it to all . also very kid friendly ! ! ! 
a top choice in flatiron and likely best greek mediterranean in the city . i rarely drop by the area , but when there i definitely make the effort to eat at quality places . ilili is phenomenal beyond just food the trendy , dim-lit ambiance and personable staff are the complements that make the entire dining experience there so great . the menu is packed with great options , sometimes even a bit overwhelming . if you come with a group of N-N , i highly recommend the royal feast which is a dozen of the most popular dishes ( plus it solves your potential anxiety of just not knowing what to pick ) . most definitely my favorite dish ( not included in the feast ) is the duck shawarma ( see pictures ) - the duck itself is well prepared and the sauce vegetable pairings that its wrapped with go down superbly . the candy bar seems to the be the most popular dessert , and it sure is great if you have room . price is reasonable and portions are generous . highly recommended ! 
pros - akamaru ramen delicious broth and ramen . the ramen tastes totally different from the instant ramen you usually get . ( get this with nitamago - boiled egg topping - really good ) - hirata pork buns delish ! it was so juicy ! ! - gyoza very unique - it ' s a fried chicken wing that is stuffed with meat and vegetables . - lady m mille crepe cake - tasted sort of like napoleon cake with it ' s crunchy layering . comes with small pieces of strawberry and kiwi . in the picture of the dessert menu the strawberries looked bigger . i was expecting a whole strawberry not small tiny pieces . overall this dessert is good . - nice presentation of food - can order kaedama ( more noodles for just N ) - quick service and fast clean up - nice decor - very modern . cool chairs that open on the side . ( its sorta of like missing an left arm rest . cons - a little pricey . - the wait . ( my friend made a reservation for N Npm but we still had to wait like N minutes . ) - to reserve you have to go in person on the day of
this place was amazing . the best thai i ever had . i love the atmosphere . the food was really really really good . we had four different appetizers , an entree and then dessert . i was dead full but could still eat more . i ' m not a picky eater but i rarely leave a place thinking how good it was . so when i say that it ' s good , it ' s good . 
everything from the train ride out there from manhattan , to the truly old school bathroom , to the date cake was worth it . my girl and i went out there after a late saturday night for brunch and the food didn ' t disappoint . i had the house eggs with a creamy tomato sauce , she had the house baked eggs , we also split a panini ( we ' re both thin , but figured if we ' re going out there on a Nmin train ride , we ' re going to sample everything that looks good ) . the only reason i wouldn ' t give this N stars is that the wait was longer than i ' m used to in restaurants with this good of food i think they only had two waitresses for the place on a sunday afternoon , come on ! 
eating here was a complete spur-of-the-moment choice for my family and i . it was our first time eating here . it was a friday night Npm and it was fairly empty although they do have a lot of tables . walking in my first impression was that the decor was really dated . the manager greeted us in the front from his seated position and seemed bothered that he had to get up . my wife ordered a pi a colada and sent it back because it was tasteless and bland . we ordered mac and cheese for our Nyr old and it looked like mac and cheese soup when it came out . we had to drain out the watery cheese sauce onto another plate . i ordered the fish chips . the waitress admitted they were frozen which i appreciated but i stuck with my choice . i wasn ' t in the mood for a steak . overall our waitress was nice , the decor was dated , the food was average at best . admittedly none of us had the steak though so i can ' t comment on that . being that it is a steak house that is important to note . 
love love love this place . the staff is friendly and the food is absolutely delicious . byob which is always a plus . they will even offer appetizers family style . great little family restaurant . 
this was the last stop on our tour de celebrity chef restaurants and it was the best , yet . . . we have seen chef scott rag on chopped contestants over and over again for their pasta and other italian dishes , so we had high expectations about his own food . the restaurant is very inconspicuous and there is no real sign on the street front . there is a small plaque , but i would save up and purchase a little more signage ) with that said , the restaurant was packed at N N p . m . on sunday N-N-N when we dined . i guess maybe they don ' t need a better sign after all . . . to keep this short , the wait staff was impeccable . absolutely professional , courteous , helpful and friendly . i cannot make any suggestions as to improve service and this staff was the best in any restaurant we dined at in the city on this trip and perhaps anywhere . the decor is nondescript and the lighting is dark , but that was not a big deal for us . the bread basket has some wonderful surprises . . . there is a bread with warm meats that is to die for . . . we greedily asked for more and were pleasantly rewarded with another basket ! my wife and i shared the seared diver scallops and they were prepared perfectly . awesome . we also shared the creamy polenta , which i understand is a signature dish of chef scott . wow , absolutely incredible . a six or more star dish in and of itself ( on a scale of one to five stars ! ) . my wife ordered the bow tie pasta with squid ink on the recommendation of the waiter . i had the spaghetti . half way through our dinner , we switched entrees because we were each interested in what the other had ordered . we each agreed that both dishes were delicious with the squid ink being the more exotic and better of the two . i would gladly order either one again . for desert , my wife ordered the coconut panna cotta which blew both of us away . it was truly the best culinary surprise we have had in a very long time . thank you for that . . . i ordered the amadei chocolate cake and it was good all on its own . i especially liked the salted caramel gelato . at this point , you can probably guess that we are big fans of scarpetta as are , apparently , many other people . moreover , i totally respect chef scott ' s authority and rights to rag on substandard pasta . chefs of chopped rise up and be inspired . we were . thanks for a memorable meal . dinner with no drinks was around N . N . 
came with my family and ordered variety of food ( half the menu recommended by the waiter ) . we were satisfied with the food , all agreed that it was better than pinto , and made us even want to go back for dinner right after our lunch . . . . . . . if you realy cannot decide what to start with , always get papaya salad for thai places - because if they know how to make papaya salad , they know how to cook thai food . 
i go there all the time , the food is very good , love the dulce de leche and the herb chicken . service is really good , specially angelic , she is so kind ) 
i came here for a quick lunch . the buffet was delicious , and very reasonably priced . the decor is fun and cozy and the staff is friendly . i would definitely come back next time i am in town . 
i went here with my dear friend megan d . ( see her review on N N N , i ' m the vegan friend ) to have one of our usual ' catching up on life ' dinners . i was pumped that they had vegan moussaka , which i ' ve never ever seen on a menu . i ' m an astoria native and grew up on a friend ' s yia yia ' s moussaka but haven ' t had the real stuff since going vegetarian N years ago . it didn ' t live up to my extremely high expectations but it was pretty good . this is an australian restaurant making a vegan greek dish so there is that to consider . it was only an appetizer so i also ordered a veganized version of the bondi sandwich . it was basically just grilled veggies on bread . not super exciting since that ' s the standard ' vegan option ' in most places . i saw they had vegan tacos but to be honest , the combination of ingredients didn ' t sound that appetizing to me . i do appreciate that they have a few menu items labelled as vegan but i think they could but a bit more effort into making these dishes worthwhile . i think the moussaka could work as an entree instead if it was a little larger of a portion . overall my experience was ok but not great . oh , also our waiter was adorable and told us about all the australian things the menu items drinks we ordered were . 
if expensive sake isn ' t your thing , then don ' t bother coming here . i ' ve been here once before , a couple years ago , with a few friends and remember the sake being expensive and the food portions being extremely small . . . . this was still the case last night when i stopped by for a nightcap follow dinner right across the street . we opted for the desserts and a few select dishes from their main menu . when i asked the server what ' the weirdest dishes ' on the menu were , he pointed to the tuna tartare ( what . . . the . . . hell ? ) and some other fried squid thing . dog . when you ' re working at a japanese restaurant , you better hope there ' s something more interesting than tuna tartare on the menu . the fried squid came out bland and tasted greasy . the dipping sauce was some weird mix of sriracha ( sp ? ) and ginger . i ordered a caviar dish that wasn ' t too bad but the fish on which it lay was soggy and . . . . wet . the souffl that my gf ordered was delicious though . . . so there ' s that . i don ' t know man . i still think the coolest part about this place is the restaurant . 
terrible service . first we requested a coke . instead , without clarifying that they did not carry that , they opened up a bottle of some other sparkling beverage that did not at all resemble a coke . not offering it is fine , but not informing us that they were substituting before opening the bottle was ( and became ) a problem . then , we requested to have the N fixed menu that was ( and still is as of this writing ) offered on the page . we were told that it was not available on holidays , even though it was a monday and neither the yelp announcement nor the printed menu made such an exception . on top of that , despite the announcement that continues to be on this page , the manager declared that the restaurant did not announce the special on yelp ( i hope they get a handle on whoever ' s responding to posts then ) , and they would hold us responsible for the drink that we did not actually request . 
 , is a great restaraunt . came in saturday afternoon N N N during a f tbol game . very traditional serbian atmosphere , well worth the long walk from penn station . food is great as well , beers are a little pricey , but worth getting nikiko since this is the only place in the us it ' s available outside of chicago . i ' d come back and make a regular stop on my trips to ny in the future . 
love love love this place . not a bad thing to say . food wise , i am a vegetarian , but anybody can eat the appetizers . i suggest fried pickles or mozzarella sticks . perfect . veggie burgers are home made and delicious . fries are always great . service wise staff is always incredibly friendly . maybe it ' s because i come here almost weekly , but they are all awesome people . i ' ve had some great nights here and will definitely still be a regular . 
good reasons to ever be at broad snyder s N - N
love , love , love ! came here with my gno group and had an exceptional time . server bailey was so helpful and recommended a great bottle of wine . we loved our mains lamb , venison , snapper , and a burger . all cooked perfectly . plus , mark simmons came out to see how we were enjoying our meal . classy . also , he ' s easy on the eyes . we ended the meal with a shared pavlova . delish ! 
went back for brunch and was pretty disappointed . the wait was an hour , so we took a few walks around the block , eventually got called and just waited more . service is still stellar but in general i just feel like i threw my money away . very simple , but if you know how to cook breakfast yourself- just stay at home . N for a single sausage also is just ridiculous . no matter how posh the pig was - i need more then that . thinking their dinner menu is just better . might be back , might not . 
waited in line for about an hour on thursday night and came away with the conclusion that the only way anyone could enjoy this burger is because they had a few too many to drink while waiting in line . the fries were plain and not that great . the patty was way too large and there were no condiments or sauce . service was quick once we got seated but there is definitely no cause for the hype . if i want to eat a piece of plain cooked meat i can achieve that using my foreman grill and not spending money at corner bistro . if i want a tasty burger , i can go to shake shack , blt burger , or burger joint . corner bistro is not even in shake shack ' s league . 
horrible ! ! ! ! ! went from the best pizzeria to a place i wouldn ' t give food to the homeless . just a shame . have to find a new go to place for pizza . 
no ambience unless you like very small diner feel , but the food is great . the pork chops are amazing and quite lean . nothing is over flavored but rather cooked into the meats . the cubano was decent and the meats tasted fresh and moist . the beans are bit watery . i still miss versailles in la for truly good cuban food . 
i ' m giving three stars only for the fact that our first experience was during valentine ' s day dinner and , overall , it was a positive experience . the space is cool without pretension and the staff were very friendly and helpful despite the rush . my date had the lobster prepared three ways and was happy however , my cassoulet was salty to the point that i could only comfortably finish half the dish . the chocolate desert hit the spot . we ' re definitely looking forward to visiting again when it ' s not so busy . 
so . . . i really like their food . . . but they took three hours to deliver . they called me after an hour and said it would be N minutes . i called them after N hours and they hung up on me . wtf ? 
food is ok , but the servers will confront you if they think you did not tip . in my case i tipped the cook as soon as he was done N . i paid my bill N for N people and i was confronted by a server who did nothing at our table asking me if i planed to tip , when i told her i tipped the chef she wanted to know how much . being in shock over her approach i just simply replied ask him . i can ' t believe how petty and desperate people can be . 
genuinely bad bahn mi . especially because i ' m such a huge fan of viet food , it sorta made me sad to trek here to have a " meh " experience . i got the shredded chicken bahn mi which was pulled out of a freezer and very frozen shredded meat . my boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich which was better than mine but overall , still not good . both of them just tasted frozen with slabs of sauce on them . we also shared an avocado shake which i must say was delicious ! however , other than that , pretty blegh experience . will not be coming back again . 
awesome food ! good service , the prices are very reasonable . the service is excellent . small family style place . byob must try the risotto the name is well earned
 N for a kilo of fresh , hot , handmade tortillas is an outrageous deal ! they are delicious and dirt cheap- a rare and exceptional combination . 
food isn ' t bad , but service is horrible . the waitresses spend their time yapping away rather than serving , and give dirty looks when you ask them to assist you . also , the tables are ridiculously small . 
i am a fan , the food and service are excellent . sat at the bar for happy hour with a few friends and enjoyed a mojito and a few small plates . sate down for dinner and enjoyed myself very much . price point is very good for the area we ate and the crowd was very chic . had a great meal and look forward to my next time at ofrenda . 
honestly , this is hands down the best restaurant in astoria . the menu is broad and will have something for everyone . personally , my entree was a special ( lamb ) . it was tender and perfectly salted . the appetizers were also delicious . i had the opportunity to sample a few because i went with a group of N . overall , i would highly recommend this place for any occasion . 
burger was amazing . perfectly cooked , juicy and the bun held up ( unlike corner bistros burger ) . the garlic parmesan fries were delicious . everything seemed to be cooked to order . i ' ve found a new burger joint ! ! my wife had the salad which she really enjoyed as well . if you ' re in lic , def check out this spot ! ! 
where shall i begin , my wife and i honestly felt like we were on an episode of punk ' d this place is really cute and the food is pretty good but this particular staff member ( hispanic descent i believe ) just doesn ' t belong in the restaurant profession . N . this particular waitress bought my wife and i two less than half filled cups of water with lemon stating all of the pitchers were empty and instead of just taking the extra second and refilling the non filter water pitcher or our glass she thought bringing which looked liked it was N leftover cups of water from another table to us made the most since ( really ? ? ? ) N . are order was incomplete we ordered the exact same thing , N eggs home fries and bacon . we received everything but the bacon when questioning our incomplete order this waitress states to us we have to mention we want bacon or sausage or she ' ll assume we didn ' t want either . really ? ? ? ? ? what happen to the customer is always right attitude , the fact of the matter is in this case we were right as she provided us our bill the same time she delivered our food and guess what , we were charged the meal price with bacon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! N . N ea . so after this waitress proceeded to think she clarified our ordering error she decided to bring back one order of bacon ( N pieces ) , remind you we order the exact same order so wouldn ' t you expect N side orders of bacon . ( really ? ? ) at this point it pretty clear there is some cognitive issues with this girl , what boggles my mind is she really believes she ' s good at her job but the fact of the matter is she needs to slow down hear the customers full order request stop chit chatting in the back about nothing relevant to the business at hand . just went you think her errors couldn ' t get worse , check out time ! ! ! ! ! our order came up to N . N i gave her N N " s and she provided me back N . N uhhhhhh . . . . . once again sloooowwww down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and she provided me with some lousy excuse as to her error . she is a very hi spirited girl and i think she ' ll fit in some profession outside to waitressing . bottom line is and establishment is only as good as its help and trust me when i tell you this staff member will continue to bring negative reviews views as long as she continues to work there . just my opinion --- and obviously others aswell if you look at the rating chart for the last N months
i tried this place twice after passing it a few times , once was for a pizza delivery and once to dine in . after both experiences i felt compelled to write a review . i would never eat here , or order again , ever . agree with the others who wrote about the staff ' s attitude . their staff and them , are rude , and kind of an overly macho bunch and this was just from ordering a pizza for delivery ! the pizza was below average and overpriced . despite my first disappointment with the delivery from order to actual delivery , i decided to give them a second chance and stopped in with my husband this time to see if it was maybe just the delivery end that was like this or they had a bad night or something , and sister was i wrong ! again they were rude , with a bad attitude , again ! so it was definitely not a one time fluke or something of that nature . as i looked around , i saw others eyes just widen in amazement with the way they treated their other customers , as well , not just my hubby and i . i didn ' t even finish my antipasto , and the first bite of the chicken parm tasted like a frozen supermarket cutlet reheated with cheap sauce and cheaper cheese , so we just left their " bella casa " ( could not be more of an inappropriate name ) . nauna ' s , if you ' re going to serve nasty food , you might want to drop the ridiculously nasty attitudes . found a famous rays , and took my business there , and love famous ray ' s . 
this is one of my favorites thai restaurant in the area . i usually go here to order the more hard-to-find thai cuisines . the price usually come out to be around N-N for two people--of course this depends on the type of food you order . but overall , i highly recommend this place for trying out more authentic thai dishes . 
i have been going to panda house since i was N . i am N as i write this interview and have gotten to know the family that owns it very well . they are some of the most generous and friendly people you ' d ever meet and the food is simply the best i have ever had . i have had chinese food in many other places and still cannot find a place even comparable to panda house . furthermore , they will always make you anything you like , even if it ' s not on the menu . they will substitute bean curd ( tofu ) for almost any meat and be happy to turn a fried dish into a stir fry for those who are watching their waist or simply don ' t want fried foods . you can ask for sauce on the side , brown rice , etc . you order how you like it . they will make it for you . i cannot rate this place any higher . you won ' t be sorry you went . 
i didnt understand all the great reviews . i actually came here because of the abnormally high ratings . i had the sausages as a starter and that was probably the highlight of the show but things declined . we didnt get any of the star attractions as we wanted to experience something a little different . star attraction here i would believe is the shredded pork stew in a tomato base and perhaps the paella . instead we had liver with onions , lol . i dont expect liver and onions to cause any sort of rave but it came out dry and dreary . liver is boring enough but when they dont pay attention to detail and overcook it it becomes a sad dish . i only ate this dish because of the strong iron content in liver that might be left after its brutal scorching or perhaps it was just reheated the Nth time , who knows . had the roast pork and it was perhaps mistreated the same way as the liver . also had the chicken that was drowned in garlic sauce , the chicken was also mistreated as it was severley overcooked . it was drowning in an uber concentrated garlic sauce that was the only thing that i was able to taste as the chicken breast chunks naturally lacks flavor then overcooked . plaintains were good , platanos will always be platanos . sangria was nice but i ' m an alcoholic and need a little more booze to feel it . i didnt feel anything . the service was attentive . the area does not lack awesome food . a rotisserie chicken dinner would of been much cheaper and enjoyable . 
this place is so good . the food is authentic , and so is the atmosphere . i have been N times , and usually order the baba gnaoush and the mousaka for the main . delicious . some of my family is from north africa , and the food is similar , so i would say that i am a good judge of this type of cuisine . the service is always prompt and friendly , and the location is on a good side street , and also they have had a band playing once when i went . always lots to take home . i highly recommend this restaurant , it ' s actually my favourite , and i ' m out to eat a lot ) 
if you ' ve come to philly for a cheesesteak , geno ' s is the only way to go . they use real marble-sliced beef and real provolone . the place across the street , pat ' s , uses steak-umms and cheese whiz . enough said . 
loved the selection of ice cream gelato . i had the apple turkey panini there which is pretty good . the indoor seating is big big so it is good to come with a group of friends to catch up
i heard from the general manager and she apologized saying that is not common practice . she validated me and made me feel so much better . we will try rho again and i will review again ! i commend the management for handling my concerns . 
been to pat ' s too many times to count . i consider pats to be the yardstick to compare all cheese steakks to , and yes , many are not nearly as good or should not even be considered cheese staks , and occasinally , some joints are better . over all , pat ' s does not ever disappoint though , the bread is a big part of it , and pat ' s rolls are excellant . great condiments too . 
bibou was another restaurant on our top N of philadelphia list so we gave them a try about N months ago on that random cold and snowy friday we had . they are a byob so we brought N bottles of wine to enjoy with our meal . i had the consume with a pouched quail egg for my appetizer which was out of this world . my boyfriend enjoyed his first ever foie gras which he loved . the rest of our meal was just as delicious . the only downfall to bibou is they are yet again another one of those places whose food is spectacular and their space is so very limited . it is very tight in there and as i mentioned above we went on a very cold nasty evening and were sat at the table next to the door which is only shielded by a thin sheet curtain , needless to say we drank our first few glasses of wine with haste as to not freeze while we were eating . 
mediocre . . . sea bass tacos were ok , guacamole was decent w good chips , margarita kinda sucked , and the creamy poblano corn rice was ok but rich very salty . i wouldn ' t go back . make the drive and go to agave in lewes , de ! 
great atmosphere ( english pubbish ) and decent food . i had the autumn salad and a burger . the bun tasted straight out of a bag . . . and i had asked for the burger without the bun in the first place ! service sucked ! my waiter brought me a glass of pinot noir that looked like it was N water . i sent it back and ordered a malbec which was chilled ? ! ? ! and of course the waiter acted stupid oblivious to my comments complaints about the watery pinot noir ( literally it was crystal clear around the edges ) , the chilled malbec , and the bun i didn ' t want ( i was very nice about it , not rude at all ) . won ' t be dropping any major cash here again ! ! 
i think this place was just fantastic . friendly atmosphere , good sake , fresh , well-prepared food , big portions . great big slices of fish , delicate tempura . we definitely look forward to returning . try the sushi combos you won ' t believe how much sushi you get for N . the tuna tataki was amazing and so fresh . . . hope they do well ! the listing here has the wrong address or they moved , it ' s N central and the do have a bar . ( yay ! ) 
quaint , no frills mom and pop shop off the beaten path of the main strip . my friends and i came here for lunch and i decided to try the bi bim bap and my husband ordered the salmon bento box . i was quite surprised to find a korean japanese restaurant in the area . food was good and served with a selection of the kim chi side dishes with the meal . this is a very casual dining location that you can take the kids . 
our go to celebration spot . attentive service , comfortable atmosphere and reliable menu . bread is recognizably witherspoon . mezza sampler , bruschetta and calamari hit just the right notes . oricchiette , moroccan chicken and short ribs are satisfying . put your trust in the staff for suitable wine pairings . dessert is good , but you ' re a block away from the bent spoon ! 
they ' re definitely very friendly at this joint ! but unfortunately that ' s all they have to offer . the food lacks in comparison . you come in and you ' re so ready to give the place five stars ! in fact , your fingers are itching to ditch the convo and get to yelping . but the more you ' re into the experience , the more you ' re lamenting the fact that you didn ' t really find this one special place in the west village but just a cool place with alright food . seating was quick---maybe everyone in the west village already knew something we didnt ? drinks were average . the steak was good , and whatever comes next to it was above average . but the chicken quesadilla---que fue eso ? i ' m not sure what that was really , or why there was deli meat inside of it . i know it didn ' t say the quesadilla comes with chicken , but warn a woman if i request some in it ! if i would ' ve been told , um hey , yeah , that chicken . . . comes out of a bag . . . then def would ' ve stayed away and saved my boyfriend from eating it sorry baby . 
the meal got off to a bad start when our waiter brought us one bowl of minca ramen when we had ordered two . considering the fact that we were the only customers there at the time and that we were starving , that left me a little annoyed . we had to wait a few minutes before the second bowl arrived . i had heard so many good things about this place so perhaps my expectations were a bit high . unfortunately , those expectations were not met . the noodles were decent , quite firm ( probably because they rushed our second bowl to us when they realized they had not taken our order correctly ) . the pork was nice and tender but the broth i found to be quite bland . perhaps next time i should try one of the heavier broths . in any case , the meal was acceptable , not bad , but not very memorable either . if i ' m ever inthe neighborhood , i would probably stop by for a bowl but i doubt i would go out of my way to visit this place again . . . 
do not go . the only redeeming quality is that it delivers . the pizza is greasy and tasteless . the owner is arrogant and actually scolded customers who took too long to order . he was impatient and unprofessional . do not waste your time or money . the owner is constantly prioritizing young females and harassing them with cat calls . he also berates his workers in front of customers . what a waste of real estate ! 
the mojitos are fantastic ! if i hadn ' t had so many i ' d be able to give a better review of the food , but after the empanadas my momory got a little hazy . the empanadas were wonderful as well . the chicken and potato were my favorinte and i could eat the ( aji ? ) sauce with a spoon it was so good . great asmosphere . i ' ll definitely be back . 
i am so glad i was able to finally make it here for a meal . my visiting friend from dubai and our former boss and her friend all joined me for lunch here last week and they were suitably impressed . the service was a little off , but i think it was our waitress only because the other ones were pretty on point and helped when she was away . the hostess was very accommodating and the atmosphere was relaxed . i had the goat cheese sandwich , which was lovely and they allowed me to substitute the salad with the rosemary fries ( with lovely crunchy bits of rosemary everywhere ) . the other diners had the special tuna burger and the cod and were very happy with their choices . the portions are a little on the big side for lunch , but that just means that i ' ll have to come back here and try something lighter so i can get the dessert . yay jane ! 
smoked mozzarella and pesto slices , wow ! ! 
unbelievably good food . great all around service . for the quality level the prices were reasonable as well had maine mussels in a broth as an appetizer that were really great and for dinner the seared tuna . fresh , well seasoned and different than the typical preparation . really enjoyed it . 
sticker shock ! a pre-fix brunch for N was totally over-priced for the underwhelming entres ( N eggs benedict , and N a salad with cured ham and smoked fish . if the ham and fish are so precious , don ' t skimp on the baby greens ! it was a small salad . ) . remember that commercial where ' s the beef ? ! that ' s kind of what i felt like asking my waiter . but i can ' t take it out on him--he was a good server . the pre-fix included drink and desert , but really , who needs desert at brunch ? the menu options were off , too . this is the second time i ' ve been here for brunch . the first time i accepted the N tab because i ordered a few things to try , including the great lobster omelet and the lovely N bloody mary . but really , the sticker shock on this unexciting brunch for N ruined it all . a word to the wise , don ' t believe the hype . 
four star food , two star service . i ' ve had to wait for a table even with a reservation . the lamb sandwich ( with chickpea frites ) is amazing . i could only eat half of it before i was nauseatingly full so the portion size was generous as well . 
although i am a lazy ass and part of the appeal of this place is the five second walk from my apartment , the food here is far above par bar fare i would and do classify it as gourmet comfort food . each day a list of specials brings variety to the menu ( please try the mozarella salad when prepared with yellow tomatoes ) . beer list consists of more rare delights . just like most bars in philadelphia , the atmosphere is laid back and casual . be aware that higher quality does mean slightly higher prices on some entrees . i am in constant turmoil over whether or not to follow through with my new year ' s resolution to eat out less or indulge in their nachos and a burger . check this place out if you are near head house square and looking for something new . 
a cozy l ' il slice of east village life . if you haven ' t yet had the pleasure . . . what are you waiting for ? 
great falafel sandwich which comes either of three flavors your green ( traditional ) , hariisa ( a little spicier ) or red flavored falafel . not a large place more of counter on one side and a railing with a few seats on the window but just step out and sit on the bench under the trees . we ordered and within N minutes had our sandwiches . 
i love their burgers ! i usually go for the monday N burger special . i order the deck burger without the mushrooms , onions and tomatoes ( not a fan of them ) , medium . it always comes out as ordered with a huge side of fries . the fries are always hot and i always have to get a doggie-bag for half the burger . my favorite order on other nights is the toasted ham cheese . . . always piled high with ham and a generous portion of hot fries . the host , wait staff and bartenders are always pleasant and friendly . when i let my server know i ' m in a hurry , they always bring my food out pretty fast . the only thing i wish they ' d do is offer the N burger special on other nights as well . i ' d definitely be there a lot more . whenever i ' ve been there , the many tvs always have some sports event airing and the staff is usually willing to change a tv to a different channel ( sports , or course ) upon request . . . especially if you ' re in a less crowded area of the restaurant . the bar area is to the right and the seating area is to the left . while the pub is in a good location geographically , the parking situation leaves something to be desired . fortunately , i don ' t have to worry about parking . it ' s definitely on my list of favorite places . 
cool place , tucked away in a nondescript alley . the food is pretty good and the drinks are good . however , there ' s typically a bit of a wait every night and a lot of lumberjacks diner here . or they could just be hipsters . i don ' t know . 
this place is the most unprofessional restaurant . the meal are way over price , the food has no flavor it is bland . the owner only care about how much money they are making and nothing about the customer and the service . 
as a result of the stewart ' s being closed next door , we ventured here for some modestly priced diner fare . we were seated straight away and the server started friendly . my friends ordered three root beer floats and i asked for coffee . the server joked if i actually wanted another root beer float or ice cream in my coffee . i didn ' t like that , but there was a laugh had . the floats were good , to hear it from my friends . the coffee tasted like garbage . i like my coffee black , but had to add cream and sugar . we then ordered food . rueben melt , disco fries , and chili cheese dogs with onion . the dogs weren ' t on the menu , but they agreed to make it . when water was brought out , we were asked who wanted the pink water , which had fruit punch traces in it . the fries came out about N minutes later . the instant gravy was not flavorful but the texture was fine . the cheese wasn ' t melted , but the rest of it was hot . a strange smell met my nose when the main courses came out . could ' t identify it . the burger wasn ' t cooked to temperature . the dressing was off , the sauerkraut was on the verge of rancidity , and the bread was stale . i took three bites in the hope that it got better , but it didn ' t . the hot dogs were boiled and unusually pale . there was no onion . just before they came out , the server mentioned an increased cost associated with the extra items . if only they mentioned it sooner . when asked if it were a dollar more , the server replied " yeah , whatever . " the price was doubled . the friend described it as the worst hot dog they ' d ever had . we ' d said as much to the server and he replied that we didn ' t have to eat at the establishment . after that , our food was rushed away . we left right as soon as we could . this could ' ve been worse , but it was still a displeasing experience . not returning . 
yummmmmmmm ! their chicken biscuits are to die for . so crispy and delicious . i ordered the chicken biscuit with pimento ! again , yum ! def . recommend ! i also ordered dessert . i had the chocolate cake . not my fav , but it was still tasty and i didn ' t leave any bites , so that says something right ? ! the owner , john , is so nice too . he told me all about his and his family ' s story . as i can tell by the other reviews too , the owners really do make this restaurant a N-star location . wish i lived in the area so i could return . i wish i had more as i ' m writing this review . yum yum ) 
i love peaches ! ! ! 
the best chicken and rice - period ! with spicy red sauce and white sauce and warm pita . . just thinking about it is making my mouth water . . . i sometimes get cravings for this dish and in the past have driven to nyc just for this ) it ' s the place worth driving for ! ! 
best burger i ' ve had in a very long time . 
samosa chaat is excellent . i got it wild ( extra spicy ) and it didn ' t disappoint . staff is friendly and courteous . highly recommend if you ' re in west philly or visiting . 
somehow , as many times as i have been to cafeteria , i have never been late night and maybe that explains why some reviews are less than stellar . . . hands down these kids know how to throw out comfort food without making you feel like a gluttonous pig for ordering . . . or maybe that is just my perception after a couple cafeteria cosmos while i was waiting for my food . . . however , they rock the fried chicken , country fried steak , mashed potatoes , greens and of course the mac and cheese . the calamari salad is so good and it gives you almost the feeling that you chose something healthy to eat . . . bustling atmosphere . . . busy waiters who appreciate a little humor . . . the occasional celeb like susan sarandon with her daughter or philip seymour hoffman just relaxing and not being bothered . . . and did i mention the cafeteria cosmos ? ? specifically ask for the cafeteria cosmo--i don ' t typically like cosmopolitans but their signature one has been the catapault for some of my most fun-filled drunken sprees ) 
usually we go to pepe ' s , but it ' s not because we ' re ideologically opposed to sally ' s . often sally ' s has been closed when we ' ve wanted to try it . when the line at pepe ' s was quite long the other night , we decided to try our luck at sally ' s which was open . bad idea . we waited outside for about an hour and a half before giving up . our good spirits soured when , arriving just to the door and becoming first in line , two parties of four--apparently with reservations--were admitted before us . i asked the fella who was apparently the manager how long we ' d still need to wait , and he said about fifteen minutes . ok . wish i ' d known about the reservations , although apparently they ' ve always taken them . but even the people who came in with reservations were waiting a little while . wonder how that works . anyway , N minutes might have been accurate , but we didn ' t wait to find out , because people inside--who had been admitted right when we got it into line the previous hour didn ' t have any pizza yet . ( oh , sorry , i meant " abizz " . . . ) our solution ? takeout from pepe ' s which was ready in N-N minutes . 
i came here last minute with a friend for brunch . as it usually is there were people waiting inside and outside for a table - the wait we were told was about Nmins . luckily , we snatched two open bar seats and sat down . the bartender was great , i should have gotten her name to give her a shoutout . she was making some really interesting drinks and entertained all of my questions as she was doing her job . i originally wasn ' t drinking but i convinced myself to try their bloody mary and boy i was not disappointed . their mix is really good . i wanted to order one of everything on the menu to taste them as they all sounded amazingly good . we ended up ordering the chicken and waffles , and the omlet to get some healthy in . the food didnt come out that fast , but we expected that because of how busyu it was . i have had my share of chicken and waffles and this one takes the red velet cake ! the waffle is cooked to perfection and the syrup is perfect . my chicken did come out a little undercooked for my eyes , and our bartender apologized multiples and sent it right back . it came out fresh and perfect ! i will be back again to try all of the other menu items that were making my mouth water ! the trick is to snag some bar seats and avoid the wait ! 
if you have not been to heavywoods let me point out the most important factor the food . yes , they have your general beer-shot N business , cocktails , and a good selection of draft beers , but what other bar in bushwick has cajun-inspired food ? ? ? ? while i wish the chef was cooking it up all week versus wednesday through sunday , its still worth making the trip . my personal favorites are crawfish mac cheese chicken buscuit ! the bartenders truly are the nicest , and it ' s in the perfect location . when by the jefferson l- go to heavywoods ! 
upper valley life magazine is a huge fan of jesse ' s . great steaks , seafood at great prices . if visiting in may a must to stop in for their month long crabfest ! 
i love this place . i live in the neighborhood and really enjoy stopping in for one of the yummy cocktails . the food is freaking great and i like that the menu changes a lot . . . 
awesome guacamole and homemade chips . i ' d go here every night of the week if i could afford it ! 
been coming here for years . the quality has been the same , if not better . always come with family and friends . a great little diamond in the rough . 
i recently went there for their wonton noodles and was sadly disappointed . small wontons , and inside the wontons , i was eating the shells off the shrimp cuz they werent peeled all the way . wont be coming back for wonton noodles here . 
damn fine cocktails . sampled N different ones from friends and they were all great . also , the rocking sofa . atmosphere is on point ! 
i ate breakfast at ' da spot this morning and i thought it was very good and unique . how can you not like a surf-themed local restaurant in vermont , which occupies the premises of a former gas station ? the interior is somewhat stark , but very clean and decorated with surf boards , pictures and other surf hawaiian themed items . it ' s very bright , too , due to the oversized glass windows which comprise most of the street-facing wall . the service was friendly and prompt . the coffee is excellent , and at N . N a cup , including refills , is a relative bargain in today ' s landscape . my breakfast of N eggs and one pancake was cooked to order and served nice and hot . i had wanted the veggie sausage , but was informed that they had run out over the weekend and had not yet made their new batch ( it was early monday morning ) . my server graciously offered a bowl of fruit as a substitute . the fruit was fresh , too , not some canned peaches or pre-packaged fruit cocktail . it consisted of sliced strawberries , real , fresh peaches , orange slices and pineapple chunks . - that reminds me , they also make their own hot sauce pineapple-habenero . it was very tasty ! a sign on their door indicates that they now serve dinner . apparently they show surf films one night weekly . 
we were passing through ny recently for my husband ' s Nth birthday and a few friends recommended this new restaurant near their apartment . he wanted to go somewhere else but i am so glad we convinced him to try something new . the venue is beautiful , and the food delicious - simple food , done well , and with a little twist ( eg the carrot , ginger and lemon soup is enlivened by toasted chilli marshmallow ) . the best thing , for me , was the cocktails . they even make their own whiskey ! try the chocolate souffle with s p whiskey - you ' ll want seconds . we will definitely be back ! 
spanikopita was amazing here . absolutely delicious and satisfying . it was cooked to perfection . the pear cake is so very tasty to finish off the delight of enjoying a meal at boubouki . it is wonderful to see a restaurant consistent in the quality . 
so penelope is definitly one of the " hot spot " brunch places in nyc right now . i liked it , good food , nice atmosphere . i had the nutella french toast which was delicious and the sake bloody mary which was amazing . however you will wait about an hour miniumum . it is good to put your name in and then go off and explore the area . in addition , if you download the buzz table app you can get a free drink as well as know when your table is ready
i love jimmy hes on Nstreet and park ave best halal food in nyc
my family and i love this place and come here often . great food , awesome staff and atmosphere . best steak in town for the money . 
i grabbed a beef one on egg and a chicken one with herbs and spices to go , but the meats were all unfortunately a little bit too overcooked and too charred . i ' ve had the ones in the west village before , and i recall those being better , so i ' m temporarily willing to chalk this up to a one-off incident and would be willing to try it again , but these were merely okay . there is fairly ample seating for people interested in sitting and eating , which is also a plus . 
red velvet cake ! ! ! oh yeah . 
just great . . . . service food everything came here tonight to get the pulled pork and the bartender immediately remember he messed up my to go order two weeks ago and took care of me . remembered what i ate and drank and plain and simple just great service . . . food is always good but with service like that you get five stars thank you other venues should learn from u
dinosaur bbq , welcome to brooklyn ! ! ! overhearing all of the buzz about the harlem location and overseeing the construction of an abandoned fire-ridden warehouse become a popular eating establishment , i was very excited at the prospect of coming here to eat . as soon as you enter , the sweet smoke of barbecue fills the air , engulfing your lungs with its savory , hickory , slightly charred aroma . my friend and i had an event to attend after dinner , so we made the waitress fully aware that we had somewhere to be . she assured us that it would not be a problem and they would try to expedite our order as quickly as possible . the menu looked very appetizing but with little time to decide , i ordered the " smothered " mojito chicken breast sandwich with mac n ' cheese , fries and a N N lb . of the drunken spicy shrimp boil . when having bbq , you gotta have beer so my meal was complimented by a sam adam summer ale . - ) the shrimp was the first thing to come out . N pieces of medium-sized shrimp marinated in beer , cayenne , old bay seasoning and many other herbs and spices topped with a sprinkle of cayenne . peeling away the first shrimp , you could tell it had been properly boiled and had been cooked to perfection each and every single element that was infused into the shrimp could be distinguished . they also provided a little trash bucket to place the shells and other garbage which was very convenient . our entire order didn ' t take to long and came out shortly after we had destroyed the shrimp . my friend and i both ordered mojito chicken sandwiches but each one had a slight variation . however , his choice of sides were cornbread and cole slaw . the entrees were brought out but they had mixed up the sandwiches and apologized for the mix-up . the waitress offered to take it back and change it but we politely declined . it was nothing to go crazy over , we simply pulled a switcharoo and dug in . the mac n ' cheese was very cheesy and sort of pasty but still very scrumptious . the fries were as fries should be , nice , greasy topped with a moderate dash of salt . the mojito chicken sandwich was just " ok " in my opinion . there was large portion of pulled chicken on the sandwich except it was very messy to eat . i ' m sure i used like N napkins during the course of that one sandwich . thank god for that handy-dandy bucket . with the addition of their original sauce , melted cheese and sauteed onions , mushrooms , peppers the chicken tended to ooze out and fell here and there . it became a very messy sandwich to eat and i didn ' t feel it was the best it could have been . sneaking a piece of cornbread from my friend , i found it to be a little grainy and dense . the cole slaw was homemade , and it tasted very fresh and decent . during the course of our meal , the waitress brought out our check when we were N N of the way through and told us that she hoped she expedited the process of our meal and we could pay when we were ready . personally , i felt the customer service here was exquisite . i can understand other yelper ' s complaints why service may be slow because for a monday night , that place was packed , and i was having dinner at N N . people were still flocking in by the time i had left . maybe it was because the server knew we were in a rush and had somewhere to be but we were in and out in about N minutes , which was awesome . i wished i had gotten a different sandwich or possibly the bbq chicken or bbq catfish but there will always be a next time . 
new yorkers , please stop embracing mediocrity ! i have lived in alphabet city for N years and have never had a more displeasing food and dining experience . i have walked by cornerstone a bunch since they opened ( i used to love the place that was there before it ) and seen the crowds , and after eating there , i truly don ' t understand it . perhaps everyone else in the restaurant was a tourist or not from the neighborhood , but there are many better restaurants even within a block of this place at around the same prices . the food was bland , but the service was worse . . . don ' t go here just because the food is a little cheaper than cornerstone ' s competitors . clearly they have to make their food cheap for a reason , and its not even a compelling enough reason to eat there . 
we came in for brunch and were excited with the photos we have seen . way overly salted ! ! ! the burger was not eatable and let ' s not even talk about the fries . the scone was good . the beans salad was tiny and missing protein . we will not come back ! ! 
there are a few halal carts on this block , and i got food from one thinking that that was the halal guys , and that food was actually better . there was more of it , and it was fresher although they both had that taste that the grill could have been cleaned better . the halal guy ' s plate was scant on food and was drowned in sauce and iceberg lettuce and wasn ' t that good , and gave me indigestion . there ' s nothing special about their food and their competitors have better food and have shorter lines . 
i was very excited to try it for the first time , and took my wife on a valentine ' s day date for dinner at republic . the restaurant is much larger than you may think , looks amazing and had a great atmosphere . the menu is very interesting although i really wanted a burger , so that is what i had . the burger was perfectly cooked , the fries were very good and so was the coleslaw that came with it . i had a pineapple with lemon ice cream and something desert that was not really my taste , but it was fine . i would love to go back , even just for the bar side of it . very good experience , as you would expect from the owners of " mill on the river " . 
just landed in nyc first stop- table N ! quaint restaurant that embodies what we love about nyc- great pasta - atmosphere just what we love as well . highly recommend ! 
horrible and anyone who says otherwise works there or owns the place the pad thai was disgusting the curry puffs were over powering and the satay tasted horrible not to mention they gave me chicken and not beef like i was supposed to get . however on a softer note the thai rice was good but as for the rest of the meal i get sick just thinking about it and after over a decade as a professional chef and restaurant owner i would be embarrassed to serve this food . 
dinner or lunch the sushi portions are gigantic and very fresh . they also have free wifi plenty of parking in the rear . delivery is also quick and food is just the same as eating inside . you can even order online right from their website . best thing here is that it ' s byob ! ! ! 
i cannot understand why anyone likes this restaurant . the food is disgusting ! picture being invited for dinner to the home of someone who doesn ' t know how to cook . really , canned vegetables ! and lots of grease . yuck ! the place is less than N feet from my apartment but you can ' t pay me to go there . 
the best italian restaurant i ' ve been to . excelent atmosphere , price , location and food . totally recomend it . 
consistently superb meals for me at petite abeille . i am a great lover of their burgers and their to die for fries . excellent selection of belgian beers . have also enjoyed mussels . coffee is ok . 
did not like anything i ordered , even the salad . 
i celebrated my birthday here last year and i had a blast . the drink specials are awesome but the service wasn ' t too good . the place is really small so i had to make a reservation for N ppl which was okay except that they wanted me to give them a credit card for my entire group . i know they need something to start a tab with but not everyone wants to be on the same tab . i love coming to this place when i ' m with a few friends but i wouldn ' t recommend it for bigger groups . best nights to go is usually during the week ( happy hour ) 
pretty good pie , but at N per topping i ' d expect more than N pepperonis on a giant slice . 
yum ! i love this place , because the food is tasty . even though it looks kind of like a hole in the wall , the food is good and veggies are fresh . there is always a good amount of meat in the dishes , and the portions are large for the price . i haven ' t had anything from here that i actively disliked , but my favorite thing is the chicken with string beans in garlic sauce . the string beans are steamed , and still crunchy ( rather than overcooked and soft ) . i also like that with a N order , you can get free fried rice N liter egg roll . delivery is hit or miss , and can be really slow . so if you are in a rush i ' d recommend picking food up . 
i will definitely return to bluebird tavern . i loved the ambiance of the restaurant , it was dimly lit but cozy , uncrowded , and rustic . i went with my mom and my boyfriend and overall had a good experience . the appetizers were amazing . for the table , we all ordered an eggplant flatbread with goat cheese , spiced sausage , ricotta , and fontina . this was phenomenal and i enjoyed it very much . the sausage was rich while the fontina was finely grated on top of the crisp dough . we also ordered the heirloom tomato dish and the mussels with a rich , yummy broth with arugula , tomatoes , garlic , and a delicious grilled bread to sop up the broth with . speaking of bread , they served us complimentary bread with a pickled carrot sort of topping . the bread was tender and simple and the topping was tangy and crunchy . i thought it was a great , tasty , healthy alternative to butter w bread . however , our entr es had some problems . my waitress brought all of our entr es out while we were barely half way through our appetizers . personally , i find this unacceptable . it caused me to set my entr e aside and allow it to become cold . i ordered the n . y . strip steak with foraged mushrooms . the steak was done well as i ordered it medium . it was yummy but the foraged mushroom and mushroom sauce seemed to lack a certain savory quality to them . my mother and my boyfriend both ordered a chicken dish with artichoke hearts , potatoes , and a mustard sauce . bother of them found the mustard sauce to be overwhelming and it was difficult to arrange the correct " bite " with chicken , artichokes , and very little mustard sauce . i will definitely return with the intent to order only appetizers and drinks . the prices were somewhat unreasonable considering the service we were provided with . i love the food and the concept of the restaurant however , i believe bringing entr es out while we have barely began to eat our appetizers is unacceptable in a pricey restaurant . i recommend this restaurant strongly as it is one of the better ones i have dined at in burlington however , the service could have been a lot better . 
at the opening of the restaurant ( two months ago ) my first margarita pizza was stellar . however today at about N we ordered another and it was a pathetic excuse for a pizza . super super thin over baked crust , barely there over baked cheese and cold sauce . idk if they started outsourcing night orders or something , but i will not be ordering from them again . and i really want my money back . i ate something else , my dog liked the pizza though . 
i love ramen ! ! ! and i love you ippudo ! ! ! this place was so good i went here twice during my ny week stay . the most delicious part is the pork belly and broth . the soup was flavorful , didn ' t seem like was drenched with msg . the meat was tender and juicy . the only compliant i would say is i liked my noodles a little bit softer and the spice level to be a bit higher . oh and the price ! a must get pork belly buns . 
this is an awesome cuban diner in a central location with reasonable food . this N N location definitely felt like a higher end diner but the prices were low and the service was good . the oxtail empanada was the winner for the night . the other table favorite was the lechon sandwich . i can ' t wait to come back when i need a sit down restaurant to soak up the booze . this could also be a great place to green lunch at . fyi the hot sauce is hot ! 
this is my all time favorite lunch place ! for just under N ( and this is unheard of in midtown ) , you can walk away with your own , customized felafel sandwich or felafel pizza . felafel pizza you say ? indeed ! crisp has overcame nyc ' s barriers of creativity and created something no man has ever attempted . ok , maybe this is an overstatement but the deliciousness of crisp ' s pizza totally boggled my mind ! my ultimate favorite is the parisian pita pizza . although the space is a little crammed , you can always take one of crisp ' s felafel sandwiches to go and have your co-workers crowd your desk to witness how you ' unzip ' it from its very original case ( true story ) . 
i went with a group that included someone who lives in the neighborhood and has been going to this restaurant for years . we started with drinks at the bar and then moved to a table . while we originally intended to have dinner , we actually ended up just drinking wine and eating a few rounds of appetizers and it was great . everything that came out was incredibly good and the service was excellent . i would definitely go back , and would guess based on my experience that it is difficult to pick something from the menu that wouldn ' t be great . 
this pizza is great
first time at oneN . came here with the purpose of trying their famed foie gras burger aka the rossini burger . just reading the menu description had me desperately hungry . good thing i came after a rigorous pilates and yoga session . rossini burger ( kobe beef , seared foie gras , black truffle cheese , truffle mayo , mushrooms in madeira on brioche ) it was everything as promised and lived up to its expectations . N sizable pieces of foie gras piled on top of a juicy wholesome kobe beef patty . the order also came with scrumptious shoe string fries that were perfect with the truffle mayo . i was in fatty heaven . we also ordered the house-made cavatelli with brown butter sage sauce sausage and the grilled swordfish entree . both delicious as well . the cavatelli were apparently hand made on a daily basis so could definitely taste the freshness of the ingredients there . i ' m usually not a fan of swordfish but this one came tender and grilled to perfection . my only complaint was that my cocktail the pimm ' s cup while tasty and well-balanced was quite lacking in alcohol content . overall , this place was a gem . older family oriented crowd . clean modern appeal . a little on the pricier side ( N foie gras burger ) but a good solid spot nonetheless . see picture for all items described
decent new pho place that opened in the castle ridge plaza - east hanover . the beef pho was good - broth was well made , noodles were good quality , and the flavors are authentic . the price though for pho isn ' t great in terms of cost portion ratio . the small bowl ( and it is small ) is priced around N . kam man ' s pho counter is similar in taste - priced less N and the portions are huge - possibly double . if you don ' t care for dining atmosphere - kam man ' s a better deal . but i have to say the noodle quality is better here . the fried spring rolls and chicken satay were pretty good and made fresh . my brother tried the a shrimp lemongrass saute ( N ) which was tasty - a bit oily though and salty . the service was quick and friendly . our food came out within minutes . if you order at least N - you can opt to pay in cash for a N discount . 
taim rocks . i have tried a few things on the menu , but got addicted to the hummus sandwich and haven ' t been able to bring myself to order anything else since . i get mine with israeli salad , tabouli , and cabbage on a whole wheat pita . it is so good and satisfying and also super affordable . i like eating in places where i feel as though i ' m getting my money ' s worth . my only complaint is that it ' s nearly impossible to eat here when the weather ' s bad or during peak hours . when the sun is shining , however , it ' s lovely to eat outside ! 
i ' d eat at geno ' s but i don ' t know how to speak english . 
everything was awesome ! the service , atmosphere , and food . it has a certain intimacy . we will definitely return . good place for a date . a treat for adults . not sure if i would bring children . we ' ve never been to a byob , this is our chance . 
i recently moved to nj and cam to this resturant . . its one of the best indian resturant i been my fav was kadai paneer and chicken kadai
this is a nice place to eat . their sandwiches and food from the grill are delicious but their food from the deli case are lacking . i don ' t know why they can ' t cook their chicken tenders in from their grill section . they precook them and store them in the deli case which is refrigerated . one time i ordered them and when i was served them they were just luke warm and extremely dry . they have a nice selection of drinks and an amazing wine section . they also have unique gifts for sale which i like looking to see what they have new while i wait for my food . the behind the counter service could use improvement . most of the time the person who it making my order seems as though they would want to be anywhere else and doing anything that isn ' t getting my food together . they just come off with attitude . occasionally when i do go in i get one of the two people who are always smiling and friendly . i always hope that one of them is there when decide to eat at fairchild ' s . 
oh my . . . what can i say . the waitstaff was friendly and fast . the drinks were flowing . the scallops were cooked to perfection . the seafood pasta was to die for ! the price was right . i will definitely be back for seconds . 
well , for one thing , the bunny is gone . but , besides that , being pushed out of the garden by the cold weather has reminded me why i stopped going to this place before this past summer . this place used to be a really great coffee shop . i am still drawn to it for the ways in which it resembles a coffee shop . it still does resemble a coffee shop in the daytime , except that the lights are set incredibly low even then . alas , they want to be a restaurant bar and the wait staff occasionally makes it very clear that they expect the patrons to behave as such . best for grabbing an early evening drink ( alcoholic ) with a friend on a night when they have live music to enjoy . ( they close at midnight . ) also , a good place to try when absolutely everything else is closed . for example , they were open during hurricane sandy and on thanksgiving day . that ' s pretty cool . 
nice place with friendly staff . they have cover charge because of live music on weekends but its still reasonable . drink prices are very reasonable too . it seems like they had good food too but i only tried french fries . mostly its for younger crowds but i liked it overall . definitely recommend . 
brunch ? yes , please ! this is a fantastic brunch spot . super cute , friendly staff , tasty food . if you ' re not here by N Na , expect a wait . just the tip try the cinnamon spice tea--fan . fucking . tastic . 
i ' ve been to l ' artusi as part of a small dinner and i ' ve also hosted a large dinner here ( N ppl ) . on both accounts l ' artusi delivered an amazing meal and wine . i chose a family-style menu with N courses . each course had N dishes which we all shared . i suggest the scallop crudo , roasted mushrooms with an egg cheese ( sounds crazy but it ' s earthy and a real gem ) , bolognese , and gnocchi . the wine list can be a bit overwhelming in its length and organization by region v . type , so i suggest talking to your server or coming in with an idea of what you want on that front . 
love the terminal . . tons of varieties of fresh food , and plenty to eat . N stars
by far one of the best meals i ' ve ever had ! i don ' t even know where to begin . pig piggy pig . i ' ll take it all . i ' m speechless , imagine that ! and , let me add one of the best nights ever as well ! 
amazing service , amazing food . 
this isn ' t the sort of place you ' d send a foodie , but almond is a fun scene , both in the bar and in the restaurant proper . good looking crowd that definitely recalls the hamptons ( the original almond does booming business out east ) . tans in the wintertime , rolex watches and cashmere v-necks - because where else are you going to eat when you can ' t be in the hamptons , darling ? ! 
for pete ' s sake has been a destination on my radar for quite a while , and sunny sunday was the day we landed . i used to jog by the place all the time and it always looked so inviting . i would think , " why the hell am i sweating and huffing when i could be sipping a beer in the shade with those guys , " yesterday i saw things from the other side , and it was pretty nice . my buddy and i were in the area and thinking of a place to have a beer and lunch outside ( N degrees , whoohoo ! ) , fps came to mind so we headed over . the chairs i used to wheeze by were setting out in the sun waiting for our arrival . a short but formidable tap list was a welcome sight . for me , i get a bit put-off when someone unsolicited explains that kenzinger is brewed in philly , but oh well , it ' s not like this is my local , and i didn ' t order it anyway . the wait staff was friendly and chipper - who wouldn ' t be on this lovely almost-spring day ? we kept it real simple , each ordering the burger . the burger was tasty and fresh . pretty standard , but hit the spot . can ' t say much else about the menu from this visit , but our neighbors ' breakfast fare looked good , as did their " bacon bloodies . " another nice aspect of our visit was the friendly folks from the queen village neighborhood . we had two nice gals sit at the table on our left , and a married couple with their daughter on the right . you could tell they were local as their friends stopped to say " hi " in passing . pleasant company to go with the pleasant weather . overall , we had a nice time eating and drinking in the sun at for pete ' s sake . the people , both employees and patrons , we very friendly . the tap list was short but sweet , and the burger , which is always a good thermometer , was on target . also , a nice pub style bar on the inside . if you are in the mood for a few good beers in the sun this spring , i ' d recommend giving fps a try . 
the standard by which all pizza is to be measured . it changed my life . thank you , l . . . thank you , b . . . . thank you . please take a working vacation out to california to teach us how it should be done . ( even though we are not worthy ) 
the burger is excellent , the patio is a cool place to hang out . five stars . 
my fiancee and i had dinner here on a weekend trip to philadelphia . everything we ordered was amazingly good , well prepared and fresh . the service was excellent . we did not drink here so can not comment on the drinks . but the atmosphere was a perfectly romantic and intimate . the room was well decorated . the staff and server friendly . the server knew the menu and made great recommendations . i will be back and this will be one of our regular restaurants on our visits to philly . 
i almost don ' t want to write this review because i ' m selfish and don ' t want all of philadelphia knowing how good this restaurant is . . . so i won ' t say a lot . service was awesome , the food was delicious and the portions were more than generous . my girlfriend woke up this morning and said she was dreaming about doma ' s sushi . pretty sure we ' re ordering takeout on tuesday before we fly home for christmas . check out the menu online . . . this place is better than that junk in rittenhouse at half the price . 
for the past several months , red eye has been my go-to spot to get some work done on my days off and for a cup of coffee . trend looked like it would be my new place if only for its quiet and comfortable atmosphere . while red eye is great , its popularity increase has led to a noise increase and thus , a work decrease for me . i ordered a cappuccino and nursed it for an hour while i did some reading on one of the many cushioned seats in their living room-like setting . then it came time to pay . i knew my drink was N and while , i don ' t love that , i ' ve become accustomed to overpriced cappuccinos . what really irked me is the N minimum credit card charge . i wasn ' t really surprised that they had this , but i still asked how can you have a N minimum in a coffee shop where most of the menu costs less than that . ( even though they are trying their hardest to charge more for everything ) i said that i wasn ' t just going to buy something else because i didn ' t spend enough to meet their minimum and that i could go get cash and come back . they simply charged my card and that was the end of it . . . perhaps salvaging any chance of my return in the process . my want for a quiet and comfortable place to work with a few nice coffee options , which they certainly supply , perhaps supersedes my displeasure with trend ' s greediness . i ' ll bring cash next time , and abide by their minimum but come on , its N and people use credit cards for everything , its time to catch up . 
samurai ribs are good but i hate waiting forever to be seated
N stars for N of the staff being polite and super friendly vegan soft serve . 
we visited the " new " restaurant in manhattan and sat on the stools at the counter . no wait . the tuna appetizer was yummy . our ramen miso broths were nicely balanced with flavors . the pork was fatty and tasted like the chicken . maybe it was that there wasn ' t much flavor in either . unfortunately it felt heavy in our stomachs afterwards . 
i always have solid meals here . i love having lunch at ssam . the best thing is rotisserie duck over rice . with the duck scallions , ssam sauce , crispy shallots , lettuce . its much different than the way i make duck at home , so i enjoy it immensely . add the chive pancakes and you are golden . in the spring ( ramp season ) , i always get a side of ramps and any dishes with ramps in them . cant wait for it this spring . 
i went here on a really busy saturday night with a large group for a bachelorette party . ( starting the night with a byob just seems so right ! ) at first i was a little nervous with where they were going to sit us because the little restaurant seemed packed , but don ' t worry , there ' s another room up a couple of stairs . we waited for a good ten minutes while the host ( who ended up being giorgio , himself ) and one of the waitstaff took turns arranging and rearranging our table for eight . while we were waiting , two more groups ( both with at least ten people ) showed up . one guy pushed his way to the front of the line to check in and wanted to know why their table wasn ' t ready . really dude ? wait your turn . giorgio handled him as best he could without being rude and apologized profusely to us , which was nice . ( that was not the last we ' d see of that dude , by the way . he came back at least two more times demanding to be seated since they had a reservation . . . that they were N minutes late for . ) if you plan on going here on a weekend , definitely make a reservation ! anyway , on to the food - it was really good . we started with the sauteed calamari , which was interesting because it was cooked with white beans and shrimp . no fried calamari was a nice change . also , bruschetta wasn ' t on the menu , but we asked for it and they were able to make some fresh . it was very good ! for the entrees , we ordered a little bit of everything , but i can tell you for sure that there were no complaints around the table . i had the homemade pasta with a delicious bolognese gravy . the pasta was a little too al dente for my liking , but the bolognese was so good that it didn ' t matter . i know one meal that really stood out was the vegetarian grilled veggies . our friend absolutely raved about it and said it was really good . i have to say that the waitstaff here is excellent . even though there were people everywhere ( with a lot of large parties ) , everyone seemed well taken care of . as we finished our meals , giorgio came over to hang out at our table . he is awesome ! he wished my friend a happy wedding and wanted to hear details of the wedding . he had the waitress bring out some tiramisu to celebrate . i think that ' s just fantastic . we had such a great experience , that i will definitely be back in the future ! keep up the good work ! 
i ' ve always thought macaroons were overrated until i tried these . the macaroons here really set the standard . perfect texture perfect flavors . i recommend the classics vanilla , salted caramel , coffee , pistachio
i think i found my favorite sushi place in the area everything from the moment i entered was perfect . i had justin for my server he was exceptional he knew everything you would ever want to know about each offering . he made a few suggestions and i decide to go with them and i wasn ' t in the least disappointed . everything was fresh and well prepared they use the perfect amount of rice in preparing the rolls so the full favor of the fish and other ingredients come through . there are so many good choice i am sure this will become a regular stop when i ' m in the area . the beer was served in frozen glasses which just made everything seem better . the inside of the restaurant was clean and orderly and the decor is calming . if i had to say anything negative its the parking lot its dirt and rock hopefully this is just temporary while they replace the asphalt . i definitely recommend you give them a try this place rates pretty high in my opinion for great sushi . 
it ' s a fun place . it ' s fun to watch when the help line dance . and when the birthday person must saddle up . the food isn ' t the best . i don ' t like all the cheese and egg they put on their salads but that is easily fixed . just ask them not to add it . some meals i ' ve had have not been good but others have been good . their shish-kabob is horrible ! but their fillet mignon was good . so it ' s just picking the right thing . i am not a fan of the peanuts and shells on the floor . sometimes there ' s tiny bugs flying around because of it . 
the place was a great spot for a quick bowl of decent ramen . the pork was much tender than i had expected but the fat content was probably the cause ( not that i ' m complaining at all ! ) a few of the people i went with was a bit disappointed with the fact that there was no ramen that didn ' t have any pork in it ( all the different types of soups used pork broth ) but to be honest , if you ' re looking for ramen , pork kinda goes hand in hand with it . staff was very friendly , but they really should differentiate whether or not they want to bring you the bowls to the table or if they want to stick with calling you name ( but this was really not a big issue . ) some people complained about now the noodles were a bit too firm but i thought it worked very well the broth was rich and full of pork flavor . i ordered extra pork and it was a lot more than i expected but everyone likes more pork . one thing i was disappointed about was that i had to order an egg as a extra ( one would think that an egg was part of the toppings that would come with the price . ) i had also ordered a side of their pork buns which were really good . not traditional at all , but they were the perfect start to the meal . a little on the pricey side for N pieces but i think the taste was good enough . i was actually really worried about space for my group of friends , but the place had tables to accommodate all sizes . overall , the experience was good . great for a quick meal . i wish the price would drop soon because the portion size seems a bit small when comparing to ramen boy in chinatown , but i think a great bowl of ramen is a great bowl of ramen . 
real homely feeling to the good , it ' s like my mexican grandmother cooked it ! great margarita . decor is pretty cool and really adds to a great ambiance . 
this was my first visit to satish and my overall experience was not positive . walked in and there was an empty table with rice spilled all over the floor next to it . had to walk around the rice and it was not cleaned up until about midway through our meal . ( it wasn ' t as though they were too busy either . . . only N tables were occupied while we were there ) nothing stood out food-wise . tandoori meat appetizer was ok . pakora was overly greasy . the chicken curry was under-seasoned and the chicken tikka masala was so salty , it destroyed the flavors in the otherwise decent sauce . i have to say that the rice was good , which is the only thing preventing this from being a no-star review . ordered the naan , but it never came . quirky service . . . like pulling teeth to get them to explain anything clearly . judging by the constant parade of takeout bags whizzing by our table , it was clear that takeout is their thing . lastly , i did not say anything to my wife at the time , but just slightly behind her was a long fly strip hanging from the ceiling . absolutely disgusting . again , this is a takeout joint posing as a restaurant . i will not be returning . 
unbelievable london quality indian , eureka ! ! i live in manhattan , have eaten at all the places on Nth street , Nth street , plus the other high end places like tamarind . nothing compares to gandhi . incredibly fresh ingredients , subtle flavors , perfect execution and attention to detail . well worth the trip to brooklyn . i begged them to open another location in manhattan , to show the rest how it ' s done properly . 
went here on saturday oct . N . sat upstairs . ordered a great white burgundy . . . it was supposed to be a N on menu , came out N , even better for N . appetizers sloppily prepared grill tasting , chipotole shrimp , a very careless , superfresh-supermarket- grade seared ahi , a very poor excuse for sausage fig balsamic a very good crab cake , and nice butter nut sqwash raviloi ( N . N ) for N ravioli , you are kidding . a beet salad were those beets canned or boiled ? sliced poorly , ok salad with it . classic decent caeser salad i would get that again . nice job . entrees rack of lamb simple , nice , tiny portions of spinich and potato au-gratin ( am i at the french laundry ) nooo . tilapia lime tequilla sauce- bland , what sauce ? same mini sides , come on . . with fish ? i do not recomend this restaurant , for the price . we wanted to have one of the many tempting deserts but did not have time . perhaps , we will sit at the bar eat some snacks n a burger . . then order desert ! ps- we have been to this restaurnat at least N times over the past N years and have always been very pleased , this was a let down . 
vito ' s in wethersfield is a family atmosphere . the service . . . varies the staff means well and often . . . . the meals lack consistency in how the our prepared . . . . but . . . generally our family still loves it and find it as a comfortable family or date night place to be . 
i ' m italian and i went to sottocasa a few weeks ago with friends . pizza is really really good , better than some restaurants in italy . atmosphere is frendly , and i really enjoyed my experience there . another good dish is the sweet pizza with nutella very tasty ! 
came here for dinner last night and was really impressed . once we placed our order it didn ' t take long for our food to come and everything looked amazing . we got two salads the arugula and chopped salad both were very tasty and fresh , the two pizzas we got were the margarita and the special pizza that had tomatoes and baby spinach with cheese which was really good and definitely was the highlight of the meal . all in all definitely a pizza restaurant i ' ll go back . 
do you love me ? because i love you ! i cannot stop raving about this place . the service is only decent , but it is quick and efficient . the tables are a bit close together and i feared my booty might knock something over , but those two tiny things aside , this is maybe . . . maybe ! the best breakfast i ' ve ever had in new york . goddamn ! i got the biscuit sandwich . it was a delicious , flakey , buttery biscuit , with cheesy eggs scrambled to perfection and a tomato paste . they call it tomato jam . it came with a side of hash browns that are the kind that are kinda mashed and fried . sooo good . i almost licked my plate . they have blueberry pancakes and fresh squeezed orange juice . this place is so good . note they don ' t take credit cards which is kind of weird considering that his place is kind of expensive . 
awesome place in the neighborhood , we love it ! go there every couple weeks , great service , great food . their pastas are fantastic , great wine and dessert . if i would make N critique , it would be their marinara sauce with the bread , the bread itself tastes great , but they should try and replace that sauce with either a ) plain old evoo , or b ) butter or c ) a tapenade or some sorts . but , all in all , this is a gem ! 
good food , good wine , good service , good menu and beautiful atmosphere . 
come eat here ! i love their burgers . they ' re fresh and well cooked and just amazing . ( hot dogs , maybe not so much ) . the atmosphere is fantastic , service is great , and the beer cocktail selection is better than any burger joint has a right to be . 
nothing new to be said . its the orginal pizza parlor in the country . they are still making pizza the same way in the original oven . no frills , but a must on any first time or anytime trip to ny
worths special trip . very high quality food . don ' t be turned off by the location in the strip mall with shoprite . the atmosphere is warm and pleasant and friendly . the food shows the loving care of the chef . i had tortelli monte carlo which was one of the weekly lunch specials . sauteed jumbo shrimp , mushrooms asparagus with cheese filled tortellinis tossed in a pink rose sauce . N . N . excellent ! 
delicious dinner in the garden . all aspects of the evening--food , service , atmosphere--were completely satisfying . and it ' s a relative bargain . smith street has certainly changed since i lived in carroll gardens in the N ' s . who could ' ve guessed ? 
the line starts forming for dinner around Npm . tiny take out place , no seats , right across the street from the park . the definition of a mom pop operation - i waited about N minutes for my turn to order . i got N meals over rice , duck with crispy pork , duck with chicken , and duck with roast pork to go . the man picks up the duck and starts chopping away , puts it in the first box , then then second , and the third - the piece of duck he picked up was all done . the last box had less than the others and i was thinking , maybe he ' ll make it up with the other meat . but no . . . he picks up another half of duck and continues to fill the last box and tops off the other two as well . then he proceeds to add the pork and chicken portion . this was all on top of a generous helping of rice and vegetables . he finishes the masterpiece with spoonfuls of sauce - the box barely closed when it was time to get it packed up in the bag . all this for under N , three meals , it fed more than N people ( they can vouch for that ) . food was better than similar places , the price doesn ' t hurt either . i felt like i just robbed the guy when i walked out of the place , bag overflowing with rice boxes . anywhere else in nyc he can easily charge N - N for this food . i don ' t often get to eat from chinatown , but now i know where to go for some good grub ) 
this place was super authentic and tasty . the hummus was so creamy and one of the best i tasted ! the bread for dipping and the condiments was vey generous and yummy . the waitress was a bit flustered and for two things we ordered she claimed they were out and then ran to the kitchen and would come back and tell us nevermind they still had lamb . well , we were obviously happy ! i had the iskender and my husband had the lamb shish which i liked way better because it came with tzatziki . next time i plan to get that ! oh , and byo ! 
this is by far my favorite restaurant ! not only is the italian food fabulous , but the atmosphere is exceptional . the service is great too ! when we want folks to feel special this is where we bring them ( and we ' ve brought a lot ) . luca ' s is legendary among our out of state friends who request a visit upon their arrival to nj . rarely a week goes by that my husband and i don ' t have a meal at luca ' s . . . needless to say , i ' m a big fan ! 
my new go to place for brunch . the french toast was delicious , and made from local ingredients- bread made from nitty gritty grains , my favorite vt farm co . ! the bloody mary mimosa bar made the experience and a place where you can get bacon on your plate and in your drink gets an a in my book . 
i ' ve only ordered from seamless last night , however i was impressed . the food came quick and was so delicious . i had the thai mixed chicked and shrimp dumplings , which were so delicious and perfect . my friend had that spicy basil ( kee mao ) noodles with chicken it was so good ! having lunch there today ! 
we happened to decide to try this new and tiny italian byo on the eve of someone ' s family holiday dinner , so the noise level was astronomical . that being said , it was a fine time . i would score it perhaps a N . N , but given the challenge of the dining room , it was N stars for the food and service . had grilled octopus that was good quality and perfectly cooked . the mozzarella app was straightforward . i love having a bottle of olive oil at the table for bread dipping . my pasta entree was good , not great . good little spot to make your own for the neighborhood . 
the gramercy tavern is a highly-touted dining destination in the flatiron section of lower manhattan . and with good reason . the country interior design is exquisite . the front of the restaurant hosts a bustling bar and grilled food scene . make a reservation for the full course prix fixe dinner ( reservations are accepted only N days prior to your dining date and reserving on the first date reservations are accepted is a must ) , and you will find yourself in a quiet , charming dining room at the rear of the restaurant . the wait staff is impeccably groomed , professional and provided excellent , attentive service . we had questions about our wine choice , and our server ' s suggestions were quite helpful . on the menu you will see a N-course dinner and you can choose from a selection of appetizers , entrees , and desserts ( N ) or a chef ' s seasonal tasting menu ( N ) or vegetarian tasting menu ( N ) . and here ' s where the prix fixe conundrum come in . it has been our experience that prix fixe dinners often fall short compared to ordering a la carte when value is an important consideration . we had a wonderful evening at the gramercy tavern . our appetizers , my lovely companion ' s roasted lamb , and the desserts were tasty and eye-appealing . my sea bass was cooked to perfection , but the heavy peanut curry sauce overwhelmed the delicate fish and infused both the fish and the bok choy with an overly salty taste . we were pleased with the overall dining experience , but for many such a costly dinner should be memorable . for us the ambience , service , and the occasion made this a memorable dinner in the city . the food was excellent , but i can ' t say all our dishes were memorable . we would go back and try the front end bar and grill menu . our dinner did not change our less than positive view about the value of prix fixe . 
i about a year ago i would have given this place a full N stars . ( cramped space and all ) today , only N . i ' ve been going to habana for years and have always had a great time . the atmosphere is cool , the food is great and the wait staff was awesome . laid back and attentive . lately i don ' t get that . the past several times that i have gone in this year i found the hostesses and waitresses to be inattentive , and rude . a few weeks ago i actually had a waitress step up to me ( literally ) and get in my face about her tip ! ! ! ( ironically , the tip was a mistake but b c she showed her ass , we didn ' t rectify it ! ! ) needless to say , i went back to speak to the hostess and she was of no help . i explained to her that her waitress was rude and out of line . she asked me about the service , i told her it was mediocre and she proceeded to make excuses for the waitress and be extremely condescending . i was furious and told her about herself and walked out . ( breathe ) so , i recommend that you go to the one in brooklyn . you get the great food , and a wonderful brooklyn atmosphere and way better service ! ! ! ! ! ! 
if you love thin crust pizza , you ' ll love lombardi ' s . my favorite is the margarita - their standard pizza ( mozzarella , san marzano tomato sauce with romano and basil ) . the amount of cheese and sauce they put in it is just perfect they ' ll melt in your mouth . the crust is very crispy and the basil is the finishing touch . the ingredients are top notch it ' s probably my favorite thin crust pizza . i also tried the italian sausage it ' s pretty good . the meat ' s very flavorful , but i still like their margarita better . the place ' s usually packed here , so you might have to wait for awhile . the price isn ' t bad , especially since the pizza ' s huge ( order the large ! ! ! ) . i had a great experience here and i hope you guys will too . 
okay was here last weekend with some friends and tried to get in for lunch but was to busy and the line was to long to get in ( yes a line to get in all day long ) so we went back for dinner . . now the place is packed so it is a bit confusing to understand at first but once you get the idea it ' s not so bad . . there is so much to choose from all over the store , we decided just to get a few things to try . prices are okay maybe a bit on the high side , but i feel you are paying for the experience too . we waited for about ten minutes for a table which you just have to be quick to grab one when available . we were in the meat and cheese dept . , so there is only standing room tables . we ordered a meat and cheese platter with a bottle of wine , which i thought it was all a bit pricey for the portion they gave us but , and it ' s the experience to . . coffee was very good , and the gelatto was very close to the real deal . so if your in the city a must look at least , but i would probably keep away from there during the holidays , i want to go back after the newness wares off to get a better experience . 
excellent thai cuisine and excellent service by joey himself ! joey is very personable and friendly . we usually eat lunch here and always walk away feeling satisfied . the prices are great . i would recommend joey thai ' s to anyone who is interested in thai food . the food is always fresh and tastes great . the hot chile is superb ! we have many great conversations with joey and some of his customers . love it ! 
nothing but good things to say about this place ! the seats are a little weird , they have no backs and they are like tiny stools , but the food and atmosphere makes up for it . first off , we got a small sake to split between three people . it was in a can . only good things can come out of a can . the sake tasted a little sweet and was very smooth going down . my friend and i had the wok shrimp cashew nut and i ' m pretty sure my other friend had a chicken dish that also had shrimp in it . i was very impressed with the amount of shrimp in the dish , i couldn ' t even finish it all . normally places give you a few shrimp pieces but this place did not scrimp on the seafood . the service was also very fast . i swear we were in there for about N minutes total . but i never felt rushed . and they are quick to fill up your water glass ( big plus ) . i would for sure come again and recommend it to others . 
the crepe with caramel . i could only taste the caramel but the crepe itself was tasteless . it was a big dissapointment . the crepe took a while to be made . the french guy that was making the crepe was without emotions . it was a weird experience . 
wow ! just an amazing experience . it is now my favorite go to place . tucked away down a little alley . . . a friend of mine who is an ultimate new yorker who knows all the little hide away places . . i will be back ! 
this was really excellent . i had cod and mango avocado salad with a lychee martini . all three were perfect . 
first time having thai cuisine and it was excellent . . i really enjoyed the veggie spring rolls basil fried rice . . . their thai tea won my taste buds over for sure ! place was cozy which i loved . . 
salads and pizzas a must . reasonable wine list . try anything and dig the scene . 
fast in , fast out , good food , reasonable price - if you ' re headed to the italian market and need lunch before you start shopping , this is it . 
going to go with N . N stars here ! given that the health department made a surprise visit that night i no doubt believe that the place is as wonderful to eat at when the boyz in suits are back in their offices doing what they do best . . . but they are not about the food , too bad for them because brooklyn star is quite about the food ! i have to say in recent memory it was one of the best , most satisfying meals ! the dining room is decorated in a retro slash homey style with herbs in the windows and flowers all about . add that to the great staff and already the night was looking great ! the cornbread is a good place to start . . . both on the menu and on this review . . . . seems like a lot of places are bringin ' it back and of a lot of the places i ' ve experienced it ( red rooster , recette . . . ) are not doing it so well . . . i ' m from south carolina and i ' ve had a few pieces of corn bread . . . and brooklyn star ' s version is no bs . . . lol . . . its on the crumbly side with a nice corn flavor and heat heat heat . good job guys ! as for the rest . . . we had the quail , chili and bone marrow . the bird was excellently stuffed , a great size portion to share . cooked on the lovely side of medium and the accompaniment chorizo was purrfect . the chili with tripe was equally good , maybe a stretch for some as trip has a texture not loved by all , but if you like tripe you ' ll love the chili . finally the bone marrow . . . whats not to love . . . pure fat on bread . . . the life giver smeared on bread . . . if you dont love it you haven ' t lived . great job guys . . . i ' ll be back for sure ! 
my friend ' s nathania alvita took me to this place the first day i came to new york . we were walking down the street and suddenly she said that " we are here " and i was like where ' s the restaurant ? and she pointed that halal cart . i was like " what ? are u serious " , she said " yes " . i felt unsured at first , however i saw people are waiting in a very long line to buy , after N minutes waiting finally we got the food . the first bite was sooooooooooooooooo impressing and memorable . . . the food is really tasty . . the yellow rice was amazingg and the meat was really perfect . i think this is the most memorable time i had in my life . . the only reason i want to come back to new york is to eat this halal cart ! ! ! thanks a lot to nathania ! ! i will not forget this . ! 
bacon galoreeeeee ! it can get pretty loud in there , i had a hard time hearing the specials of the night from our waiter but it was okay because the food beer specials are listed on the back wall . tried the bacon beer flight ( N ) . it comes with N different beers paired with N bacon flavors . the night they offered jalapeno , apple cider , smoked apple-wood and black pepper . the jalapeno was my absolute favoriteeeee ! also tried the bacon burger with fries ( N ) . the burger was very juicy and topped with apple-wood bacon and a side of sliced pickles . the fries were crispy and perfect ! i do wish the burger came with some lettuce and tomatoes to offset all the grease . tip - they only take reservations for parties of N or larger and be sure to drink a lot of water during and after your meal ! 
great place for vegans to dine with their carnivore friends . everybody is covered . my wife and i used to go there when it was dingy and hosted cheap comedy shows . it has been spruced up and is a great place for a meal in olde city . they have a number of good vegan items including vegan popcorn . however , as a vegan , go with what pam s suggested to me the vegan pulled pork . that sandwich is killer . a taste as wonderful as the sandwich is sloppy ! seriously , you ' ll need a lot of napkins . it comes with vegan coleslaw on it . don ' t settle for that . order vegan coleslaw as your side too ! khyber knows vegan coleslaw ! you can never have too much ! just proofreading this review i want to get in my car and get that sandwich now ! 
excellent the best food ! 
this place is right near where i work so when i ' m not too busy i try to go pretty regularly . a friend turned me on to them about N years ago and i ' ve never had even an average meal . my favorite is the ropa vieja -- delicious shredded beef in sauce with some veggies . pour this over the yellow rice , mix with the beans , mop it up with the bread and you ' re in business . and even though they ' re slammin ' busy -- the staff always makes an effort to serve you quickly . . . and with a smile . for take out , order at the counter towards the back . don ' t worry , the people eating at the counter you ' re crowding are too excited about the food to notice you or be bothered . oh , and as the other yelp ' er said -- the coffee is great . 
not bad
